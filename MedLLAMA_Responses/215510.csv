You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of presumed coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) who presents with respiratory distress, hypertension, and evidence of aspiration on CT chest. Cardiac enzymes are rising, and an electrocardiogram (EKG) shows a left bundle branch block (LBBB). The patient has been started on IV heparin and is awaiting a cardiac catheterization. The patient's creatinine has improved from 1.3 to 1.1, and fluid resuscitation has resolved acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory distress and pulmonary edema may lead to hypoxia, which can be exacerbated by aspiration pneumonia.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's CT chest shows evidence of aspiration, which may lead to pneumonia and respiratory failure.
3. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The rising cardiac enzymes and LBBB on EKG may indicate ACS, which can lead to myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest.
4. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient's cardiac enzymes and LBBB may also indicate cardiac tamponade, which can lead to cardiac arrest.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine has improved, but the patient is still at risk for renal failure due to the underlying disease and potential complications.
6. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and febrile response may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and pulmonary edema may lead to respiratory failure, which can require mechanical ventilation.
8. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac enzymes and LBBB may indicate a high risk of cardiac arrest, which can be fatal if not treated promptly.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and aggressive management of the patient's condition to prevent further deterioration and improve outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of CAD and DM who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, hypertension, and evidence of aspiration on CT chest. His cardiac enzymes are rising, with troponin levels increasing from 0.27 to 1.07. He has a new LBBB on EKG, and cardiology is aware of the situation, with plans for a catheterization today. The patient is receiving IV heparin and has been started on antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia. His creatinine has improved from 1.3 to 1.1, and he is receiving IV hydration. The patient is also being managed for DM with SSC insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's rising troponin levels and new LBBB on EKG suggest the possibility of ACS, which could lead to myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's elevated WBC count and febrile state suggest aspiration pneumonia, which could lead to respiratory failure, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's initial creatinine level of 1.3 and subsequent improvement to 1.1 suggest acute renal failure, which could lead to chronic kidney disease, electrolyte imbalances, and acidosis.
4. Hypertensive Emergency: The patient's hypertension could lead to hypertensive emergency, which could cause encephalopathy, intracranial hemorrhage, and cardiac arrest.
5. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac enzymes are rising, and he has a new LBBB on EKG, which increases the risk of cardiac arrest.
6. Sepsis: The patient's febrile state and elevated WBC count suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction, shock, and death.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and requirement for mechanical ventilation suggest the possibility of respiratory failure, which could lead to prolonged ventilation, tracheostomy, and chronic respiratory disease."

   Cardiac cath [**10-28**]
   1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
   revealed
   single vessel disease with in stent occlusion of the LCX.  The LMCA had
   no angiographically apparent flow limiting disease.  The LAD had minor
   luminal irregularities but no focal stenoses.  The mid to distal LAD
   was
   a very small caliber vessel.  The LCX was occluded in the region of the
   prior stents.  The RCA had minor luminal irregularities and was a
   dominant vessel.
   2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated diastolic dysfunction (LVEDP 35 mm
   Hg), moderate pulmonary hypertension (PA pressure 36/22 mm Hg),
   elevated
   right sided filling pressures (RVEDP 21 mm Hg), and elevated left sided
   filling pressures (PCWP 22 mg Hg). The cardiac index was normal.  There
   was no inappropriate step up of oxygen saturation from the SVC to the
   PA and therefore no evidence of intracardiac shunt.  There was no
   evidence of constrictive or restrictive cardiomyopathy.
   3. Left ventriculogram done from [**Doctor Last Name **] and LAO projections showed global
   hypokinesis,  increased volume of LV, and no mitral regurgitation.
   4. . . .
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.

   4. Moderate primary pulmonary hypertension.
   5. Acute posterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.

   Assessment and Plan
 The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent.
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Titrate up Metoprolol from 12.5 mg po bid as HR and SBP tolerates.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily
   - Trend cardiac biomarkers until MB peak.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear based on current records if this was
   hypoxic or hypercarbic respiratory failure, but likely hypoxic given CT
   demonstrating bibasilar consolidations. Most likely etiology at this
   time is acute pulmonary edema given elevated filling pressures and PCWP
   suggestive of elevated right and left-sided filling pressures in
   setting of ACS with possible additional component of aspiration
   pneumonia versus pneumonitis.
   - Diurese with Lasix prn, goal TBB -1-2 L
   - Wean ventilation and extubated today if possible
   - Cover with amp/sulbactam for aspiration event as patient does not
   have any HAP risk factors.
   - Follow-up sputum sensitivities and blood cultures.
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I today as above.
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os), goal TBB as above.
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Continue monitoring on
   telemetry.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Elevated WBC with left shift suggestive of either
   infectious process or reactive leukocytosis [**2-24**] ACS.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC, culture data.
   - f/u repeat CXR read today.
   .
   # Anemia: Most recent hematocrit of 31.1 from 36 on admission after
   fluid rescucitation with unknown baseline.  Hct stable overnight.
   - Trend hct
   - Obtain PCP records for baseline hct.
   - Active T+S, transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although AST>ALT
   somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history.  LFTs today
   persistently elevated, will continue to monitor.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.
   .
   # DM 2: Cover with SSI.
   .
   # EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.
   - When extubated and off sedation, CIWA protocol with valium.

   CCU ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and I concur
   with the history, physical, assessment and plan as outlined above.
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4055**] is a 49 year old man who developed very late stent
   thrombosis following placement of two overlapping TAXUS stents.
   Successful PCI was performed with balloon angioplasty alone yesterday.
   Right and left heart catheterization showed elevated right and left
   heart pressures with a dilated cardiomyopathy and LVEF = 30%.
   He was extubated this morning and he is doing well.
   We will continue aspirin 325 mg daily indefinitely and Plavix 75 mg
   twice daily for one month, followed by 75 mg daily indefinitely
   thereafter.
   Appropriate medications including beta blockers and ACE inhibitors will
   be started for his cardiomyopathy.
   Plan was discussed with the patient.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   CCU ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and I concur
   with the history, physical, assessment and plan as outlined above.
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4055**] is a 49 year old man who developed very late stent
   thrombosis following placement of two overlapping TAXUS stents.
   Successful PCI was performed with balloon angioplasty alone yesterday.
   Right and left heart catheterization showed elevated right and left
   heart pressures with a dilated cardiomyopathy and LVEF = 30%.
   He was extubated this morning and he is doing well.
   We will continue aspirin 325 mg daily indefinitely and Plavix 75 mg
   twice daily for one month, followed by 75 mg daily indefinitely
   thereafter.
   Appropriate medications including beta blockers and ACE inhibitors will
   be started for his cardiomyopathy.
   Plan was discussed with the patient.

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM2) who was admitted for respiratory failure and found to have an acute non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He underwent a cardiac catheterization with thrombectomy of a previously placed left circumflex (LCX) stent, and was diagnosed with one-vessel coronary artery disease, moderate diastolic and systolic ventricular dysfunction, and moderate primary pulmonary hypertension. He was also found to have acute posterior myocardial infarction and was managed with acute percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O. His oxygen saturation is 93% and his respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 99 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 113/64 mmHg. His cardiac index is normal, and his left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 40%.
* Hemodynamic status: The patient has elevated right and left-sided filling pressures, with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 22 mmHg and a right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (RVEDP) of 21 mmHg.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 12.4 x 10^9/L, his hemoglobin is 10.1 g/dL, and his platelet count is 147 x 10^9/L. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 31 mg/dL, and his creatinine is 0.9 mg/dL.
* Imaging studies: The patient's chest X-ray (CXR) shows bibasilar consolidations, and his echocardiogram (ECHO) demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral akinesis with an LVEF of 40%.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is at risk for developing respiratory failure due to his acute pulmonary edema and elevated filling pressures.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and he is at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
3. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and he is at risk for developing an infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
4. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy, and he is at risk for bleeding, particularly in the setting of his elevated international normalized ratio (INR).
5. Kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is at risk for developing acute kidney injury, particularly in the setting of his cardiac dysfunction and elevated blood pressure.
6. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, and he is at risk for developing hepatic dysfunction, particularly in the setting of his cardiac dysfunction and elevated blood pressure.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

   1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
   revealed
   single vessel disease with in stent occlusion of the LCX.  The LMCA had
   no angiographically apparent flow limiting disease.  The LAD had minor
   luminal irregularities but no focal stenoses.  The mid to distal LAD
   was
   a very small caliber vessel.  The LCX was occluded in the region of the
   prior stents.  The RCA had minor luminal irregularities and was a
   dominant vessel.
   2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated diastolic dysfunction (LVEDP 35 mm
   Hg), moderate pulmonary hypertension (PA pressure 36/22 mm Hg),
   elevated
   right sided filling pressures (RVEDP 21 mm Hg), and elevated left sided
   filling pressures (PCWP 22 mg Hg). The cardiac index was normal.  There
   was no inappropriate step up of oxygen saturation from the SVC to the
   PA and therefore no evidence of intracardiac shunt.  There was no
   evidence of constrictive or restrictive cardiomyopathy.
   3. Left ventriculogram done from [**Doctor Last Name **] and LAO projections showed global
   hypokinesis,  increased volume of LV, and no mitral regurgitation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Cardiac cath [**10-28**]
   1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
   revealed
   single vessel disease with in stent occlusion of the LCX.  The LMCA had
   no angiographically apparent flow limiting disease.  The LAD had minor
   luminal irregularities but no focal stenoses.  The mid to distal LAD
   was
   a very small caliber vessel.  The LCX was occluded in the region of the
   prior stents.  The RCA had minor luminal irregularities and was a
   dominant vessel.
   2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated diastolic dysfunction (LVEDP 35 mm
   Hg), moderate pulmonary hypertension (PA pressure 36/22 mm Hg),
   elevated
   right sided filling pressures (RVEDP 21 mm Hg), and elevated left sided
   filling pressures (PCWP 22 mg Hg). The cardiac index was normal.  There
   was no inappropriate step up of oxygen saturation from the SVC to the
   PA and therefore no evidence of intracardiac shunt.  There was no
   evidence of constrictive or restrictive cardiomyopathy.
   3. Left ventriculogram done from [**Doctor Last Name **] and LAO projections showed global
   hypokinesis,  increased volume of LV, and no mitral regurgitation.
   4. . . .
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
   3. Moderate systolic ventricular dysfunction.
   4. Moderate primary pulmonary hypertension.
   5. Acute posterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.

   Assessment and Plan
 The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent.
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Titrate up Metoprolol from 12.5 mg po bid as HR and SBP tolerates.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily
   - Trend cardiac biomarkers until MB peak.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear based on current records if this was
   hypoxic or hypercarbic respiratory failure, but likely hypoxic given CT
   demonstrating bibasilar consolidations. Most likely etiology at this
   time is acute pulmonary edema given elevated filling pressures and PCWP
   suggestive of elevated right and left-sided filling pressures in
   setting of ACS with possible additional component of aspiration
   pneumonia versus pneumonitis.
   - Diurese with Lasix prn, goal TBB -1-2 L
   - Wean ventilation and extubated today if possible
   - Cover with amp/sulbactam for aspiration event as patient does not
   have any HAP risk factors.
   - Follow-up sputum sensitivities and blood cultures.
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I today as above.
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os), goal TBB as above.
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Continue monitoring on
   telemetry.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Elevated WBC with left shift suggestive of either
   infectious process or reactive leukocytosis [**2-24**] ACS.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC, culture data.
   - f/u repeat CXR read today.
   .
   # Anemia: Most recent hematocrit of 31.1 from 36 on admission after
   fluid rescucitation with unknown baseline.  Hct stable overnight.
   - Trend hct
   - Obtain PCP records for baseline hct.
   - Active T+S, transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although AST>ALT
   somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history.  LFTs today
   persistently elevated, will continue to monitor.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.
   .
   # DM 2: Cover with SSI.
   .
   # EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.
   - When extubated and off sedation, CIWA protocol with valium.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and NSTEMI, who has undergone PCI and thrombectomy of a previously placed LCx stent. The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple organ systems.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, and blood pressure of 113/64 mmHg. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated cardiac biomarkers, including troponin-T, creatine kinase (CK), and CK-MB. The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus rhythm with 1:1 conduction.

The patient's cardiac catheterization report reveals single-vessel disease with in-stent occlusion of the LCX, and moderate diastolic and systolic ventricular dysfunction. The patient's left ventriculogram shows global hypokinesis and increased volume of the left ventricle.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to acute pulmonary edema, which is supported by the patient's elevated filling pressures and PCWP. The patient's pulmonary edema is likely caused by the patient's ACS with possible additional component of aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis.

The patient's anemia is likely due to blood loss during the PCI procedure and fluid resuscitation. The patient's transaminitis is uncertain in etiology, but may be related to the patient's EtOH use.

The patient's medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, lisinopril, and furosemide. The patient is also receiving antibiotics for possible aspiration event.

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac catheterization report reveals single-vessel disease with in-stent occlusion of the LCX, which may lead to recurrent myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to worsening pulmonary edema, respiratory acidosis, or respiratory failure.
3. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's anemia and cardiac dysfunction may lead to hemodynamic instability, including hypotension or hypertension.
4. Infection: The patient's anemia and immunosuppressive therapy may increase the risk of infection, including pneumonia or sepsis.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and cardiac dysfunction may lead to thrombocytopenia, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's transaminitis may lead to hepatic dysfunction, which may worsen the patient's anemia and increase the risk of bleeding.

The patient's care plan should focus on managing the patient's cardiac and respiratory failure, anemia, and transaminitis, while also monitoring for potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent.
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Titrate up Metoprolol from 12.5 mg po bid as HR and SBP tolerates.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily
   - Trend cardiac biomarkers until MB peak.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear based on current records if this was
   hypoxic or hypercarbic respiratory failure, but likely hypoxic given CT
   demonstrating bibasilar consolidations. Most likely etiology at this
   time is acute pulmonary edema given elevated filling pressures and PCWP
   suggestive of elevated right and left-sided filling pressures in
   setting of ACS with possible additional component of aspiration
   pneumonia versus pneumonitis.
   - Diurese with Lasix prn, goal TBB -1-2 L
   - Wean ventilation and extubated today if possible
   - Cover with amp/sulbactam for aspiration event as patient does not
   have any HAP risk factors.
   - Follow-up sputum sensitivities and blood cultures.
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I today as above.
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os), goal TBB as above.
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Continue monitoring on
   telemetry.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Elevated WBC with left shift suggestive of either
   infectious process or reactive leukocytosis [**2-24**] ACS.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC, culture data.
   - f/u repeat CXR read today.
   .
   # Anemia: Most recent hematocrit of 31.1 from 36 on admission after
   fluid rescucitation with unknown baseline.  Hct stable overnight.
   - Trend hct
   - Obtain PCP records for baseline hct.
   - Active T+S, transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although AST>ALT
   somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history.  LFTs today
   persistently elevated, will continue to monitor.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.
   .
   # DM 2: Cover with SSI.
   .
   # EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.
   - When extubated and off sedation, CIWA protocol with valium.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old gentleman with a past medical history significant for CAD, s/p PCI, and DM 2, admitted for respiratory failure and found to have an NSTEMI. He has undergone catheterization with thrombectomy of a previously placed LCx stent.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 101.1°F, heart rate 130 bpm, blood pressure 159/89 mmHg, respiratory rate 27 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 97%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving invasive ventilation and has a central venous catheter.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received 1,502 mL of fluids and has a negative fluid balance of 1,918 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving non-rebreather oxygen and is on a ventilator in CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 12.4 K/uL, Hemoglobin 11.8 g/dL, Platelet count 170 K/uL.
	+ Blood chemistry: Creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, Troponin-T 1.05 ng/mL, Lactic acid 2.2 mmol/L, LDH 805 IU/L.
	+ Electrolytes: Potassium 4.2 mEq/L, Phosphorus 2.9 mg/dL, Magnesium 2.0 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan are as follows:

* CAD: The patient is to continue ASA 325 mg, Plavix 75 mg, and Atorvastatin 80 mg. Metoprolol is to be titrated up from 12.5 mg po bid as HR and SBP tolerate.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is to be diuresed with Lasix prn, with a goal of TBB -1-2 L. Ventilation is to be weaned and the patient is to be extubated today if possible. Cover with Amp/Sulbactam for aspiration event.
* Pump: The patient is to be diuresed as above, and Metoprolol is to be started as above.
* Rhythm: The patient is to be monitored on telemetry, and if any arrhythmias occur, they are to be treated according to hospital protocol.
* Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC is to be trended, and fever curve, WBC, and culture data are to be monitored.
* Anemia: The patient's Hct is to be trended, and PCP records are to be obtained for baseline Hct.
* Transaminitis: The patient's LFTs are to be trended, and if persistently elevated, viral serologies are to be checked.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Sepsis: The patient's WBC is elevated, and he has a fever, which may indicate an underlying infection.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is on a ventilator, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if the ventilator is not functioning properly.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of CAD and is receiving medications that may affect his cardiac rhythm.
* Infection: The patient has a central line and is receiving antibiotics, which may increase the risk of infection.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of DM 2 and may be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Renal failure: The patient has a history of CAD and may be at risk for renal failure.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Overnight, pt became tachycardic, hypertensive and developed
   wide-complex QRS waves on EKG.  These waves were thought to be
   secondary to tachycardia induced BBB which the patient has had
   previously.  He was treated with multiple doses of valium and ativan
   for presumed alcohol withdrawl and concern for delirium tremens.  With
   increasing frequency of valium, pts hemodynamics did not stabilize and
   developed hypoxic respiratory failure leading to intubation.  Pt was
   briefly treated with a nitro gtt which was weaned off when pressures
   stabilized.  Versed gtt was simultaneously started and titrated to
   control his hemodynamic state.  Additionally, pt was given a banana

   CCU COMPREHENSIVE PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and I
   concur with the History, Physical, and Medical Decision Making.   Mr.
   [**Known lastname 4055**] is a 49 year old man who developed very late stent thrombosis
   following placement of two overlapping TAXUS stents.  Successful PCI
   was performed with balloon angioplasty alone yesterday.  Right and left
   heart catheterization showed elevated right and left heart pressures
   with a dilated cardiomyopathy and LVEF = 30%.  We have now learned that
   the cardiomyopathy is of longstanding duration.
   After an initial period of extubation, the patient developed
   hypertension, tachycardia, and fevers consistent with alcohol
   withdrawal syndrome.  He was treated with IV benzodiazapines.  He
   ultimately required intubation of hypoxemia due to his underlying
   aspiration pneumonia.  He has been given vitamins with his IVFs.  We
   will rest him today on the ventilatory and aim toward extubation in the
   AM should his condition stabilize.
   We will continue aspirin 325 mg daily indefinitely and Plavix 75 mg
   twice daily for one month, followed by 75 mg daily indefinitely
   thereafter.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Overnight, pt became tachycardic, hypertensive and developed
   wide-complex QRS waves on EKG.  These waves were thought to be
   secondary to tachycardia induced BBB which the patient has had
   previously.  He was treated with multiple doses of valium and ativan
   for presumed alcohol withdrawl and concern for delirium tremens.  With
   increasing frequency of valium, pts hemodynamics did not stabilize and
   developed hypoxic respiratory failure leading to intubation.  Pt was
   briefly treated with a nitro gtt which was weaned off when pressures
   stabilized.  Versed gtt was simultaneously started and titrated to
   control his hemodynamic state.  Additionally, pt was given a banana
   bag.

   After an initial period of extubation, the patient developed
   hypertension, tachycardia, and fevers consistent with alcohol
   withdrawal syndrome.  He was treated with IV benzodiazapines.  He
   ultimately required intubation of hypoxemia due to his underlying
   aspiration pneumonia.  He has been given vitamins with his IVFs.  We
   will rest him today on the ventilatory and aim toward extubation in the
   AM should his condition stabilize.
   We will continue aspirin 325 mg daily indefinitely and Plavix 75 mg
   twice daily for one month, followed by 75 mg daily indefinitely
   thereafter.

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old male admitted for respiratory failure, found to have an NSTEMI, and underwent PCI with thrombectomy of a previously placed LCx stent. He has a history of CAD, DM2, and s/p PCI. The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of tachycardia, hypertension, and fevers, which were treated with benzodiazepines. He was intubated for hypoxemia due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis, anemia, and transaminitis, and his ECG shows sinus tachycardia with 1:1 conduction with RBBB.

Potential medical complications:

1. Delirium tremens: The patient's symptoms of tachycardia, hypertension, and fevers are consistent with alcohol withdrawal syndrome. He was treated with benzodiazepines, but further management is necessary to prevent complications.
2. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's history of CAD, DM2, and s/p PCI puts him at risk for cardiovascular complications. His lab results show elevated troponin-T, which suggests ongoing myocardial injury. Close monitoring of his cardiovascular status is necessary to prevent further complications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration pneumonia, and he is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Weaning him off the ventilator will be challenging, and close monitoring of his respiratory status is necessary.
4. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis are concerning for sepsis. Further investigation is necessary to determine the cause of these symptoms, and antibiotics should be continued until the patient's condition improves.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to his underlying cardiomyopathy and chronic kidney disease. Close monitoring of his hemoglobin levels is necessary to prevent further complications.
6. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis is of uncertain etiology, but it may be related to his underlying liver disease or medication use. Close monitoring of his liver function tests is necessary to prevent further complications.
7. Diabetes: The patient's DM2 is well-controlled, but close monitoring of his blood glucose levels is necessary to prevent complications.
8. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient's history of ethanol use suggests that he may be at risk for ethanol withdrawal syndrome. Close monitoring of his symptoms and treatment with benzodiazepines are necessary to prevent complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue benzodiazepines to manage delirium tremens and ethanol withdrawal syndrome.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely and adjust his medication regimen as necessary to prevent further complications.
3. Wean the patient off the ventilator gradually and closely monitor his respiratory status.
4. Continue antibiotics until the patient's condition improves.
5. Monitor the patient's hemoglobin levels closely and transfuse as necessary to prevent further complications.
6. Monitor the patient's liver function tests closely and adjust his medication regimen as necessary to prevent further complications.
7. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels closely and adjust his medication regimen as necessary to prevent complications.
8. Consider consulting a specialist in infectious diseases to further investigate the cause of the patient's fever and leukocytosis."

   Overnight, pt became tachycardic, hypertensive and developed
   wide-complex QRS waves on EKG.  These waves were thought to be
   secondary to tachycardia induced BBB which the patient has had
   previously.  He was treated with multiple doses of valium and ativan
   for presumed alcohol withdrawl and concern for delirium tremens.  With
   increasing frequency of valium, pts hemodynamics did not stabilize and
   developed hypoxic respiratory failure leading to intubation.  Pt was
   briefly treated with a nitro gtt which was weaned off when pressures
   stabilized.  Versed gtt was simultaneously started and titrated to
   control his hemodynamic state.  Additionally, pt was given a banana
   bag.

   Assessment and Plan
 The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent.
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Titrate up Metoprolol from 12.5 mg po bid as HR and SBP tolerates.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily
   - Trend cardiac biomarkers until MB peak.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear based on current records if this was
   hypoxic or hypercarbic respiratory failure, but likely hypoxic given CT
   demonstrating bibasilar consolidations. Most likely etiology at this
   time is acute pulmonary edema given elevated filling pressures and PCWP
   suggestive of elevated right and left-sided filling pressures in
   setting of ACS with possible additional component of aspiration
   pneumonia versus pneumonitis.
   - Diurese with Lasix prn, goal TBB -1-2 L
   - Wean ventilation and extubated today if possible
   - Cover with amp/sulbactam for aspiration event as patient does not
   have any HAP risk factors.
   - Follow-up sputum sensitivities and blood cultures.
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I today as above.
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os), goal TBB as above.
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Continue monitoring on
   telemetry.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Elevated WBC with left shift suggestive of either
   infectious process or reactive leukocytosis [**2-24**] ACS.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC, culture data.
   - f/u repeat CXR read today.
   .
   # Anemia: Most recent hematocrit of 31.1 from 36 on admission after
   fluid rescucitation with unknown baseline.  Hct stable overnight.
   - Trend hct
   - Obtain PCP records for baseline hct.
   - Active T+S, transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although AST>ALT
   somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history.  LFTs today
   persistently elevated, will continue to monitor.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.
   .
   # DM 2: Cover with SSI.
   .
   # EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.
   - When extubated and off sedation, CIWA protocol with valium.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent.
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Titrate up Metoprolol from 12.5 mg po bid as HR and SBP tolerates.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily
   - Trend cardiac biomarkers until MB peak.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Unclear based on current records if this was
   hypoxic or hypercarbic respiratory failure, but likely hypoxic given CT
   demonstrating bibasilar consolidations. Most likely etiology at this
   time is acute pulmonary edema given elevated filling pressures and PCWP
   suggestive of elevated right and left-sided filling pressures in
   setting of ACS with possible additional component of aspiration
   pneumonia versus pneumonitis.
   - Diurese with Lasix prn, goal TBB -1-2 L
   - Wean ventilation and extubated today if possible
   - Cover with amp/sulbactam for aspiration event as patient does not
   have any HAP risk factors.
   - Follow-up sputum sensitivities and blood cultures.
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I today as above.
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os), goal TBB as above.
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Continue monitoring on
   telemetry.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Elevated WBC with left shift suggestive of either
   infectious process or reactive leukocytosis [**2-24**] ACS.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC, culture data.
   - f/u repeat CXR read today.
   .
   # Anemia: Most recent hematocrit of 31.1 from 36 on admission after
   fluid rescucitation with unknown baseline.  Hct stable overnight.
   - Trend hct
   - Obtain PCP records for baseline hct.
   - Active T+S, transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although AST>ALT
   somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history.  LFTs today
   persistently elevated, will continue to monitor.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a past medical history of CAD, DM2, and PCI, admitted for respiratory failure and NSTEMI. He underwent catheterization and thrombectomy of the previously placed LCx stent. The patient is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation, with a fever of 101.1°F (38.4°C). He has a history of tachycardia, hypertension, and wide-complex QRS waves on EKG, which were treated with valium and ativan for presumed alcohol withdrawal and concern for delirium tremens.

The patient's vital signs are:

* T: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* HR: 130 bpm
* BP: 159/89 mmHg
* RR: 27 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 97%

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 12.4 K/uL
* Hct: 29.2%
* Plt: 147 K/uL
* Cr: 0.9 mg/dL
* TCO2: 28 mmHg
* Glucose: 149 mg/dL

The patient's diagnosis includes:

* NSTEMI
* Respiratory failure
* Acute pulmonary edema
* Aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis
* CAD
* DM2

The plan is to:

* Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, and atorvastatin 80 mg
* Titrate up Metoprolol from 12.5 mg po bid as HR and SBP tolerate
* Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily
* Trend cardiac biomarkers until MB peak
* Diuresis with Lasix prn, goal TBB -1-2 L
* Wean ventilation and extubate today if possible
* Cover with amp/sulbactam for aspiration event
* Follow-up sputum sensitivities and blood cultures

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pneumonia or pneumonitis
* Sepsis
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Acute kidney injury
* Anemia
* Transaminitis
* Hypoglycemia
* Hypertension
* Tachycardia

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan as necessary to prevent these potential complications and ensure optimal care."

   Overnight, pt became tachycardic, hypertensive and developed
   wide-complex QRS waves on EKG.  These waves were thought to be
   secondary to tachycardia induced BBB which the patient has had
   previously.  He was treated with multiple doses of valium and ativan
   for presumed alcohol withdrawl and concern for delirium tremens.  With
   increasing frequency of valium, pts hemodynamics did not stabilize and
   developed hypoxic respiratory failure leading to intubation.  Pt was
   briefly treated with a nitro gtt which was weaned off when pressures
   stabilized.  Versed gtt was simultaneously started and titrated to
   control his hemodynamic state.  Additionally, pt was given a banana
   bag.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old gentleman admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, NSTEMI, and cardiac catheterization. The patient has a significant past medical history of CAD, s/p PCI and DM 2.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated and stabilized on ventilation with a FiO2 of 100% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. The patient has a fever of 101.1°F (38.4°C) and is receiving antibiotics.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of CAD, s/p PCI and thrombectomy of the previously placed LCx stent. The patient's LVEF is 40% with mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral akinesis on TTE.
* Hemodynamics: The patient's hemodynamics are stable, with a heart rate of 130 bpm and blood pressure of 159/89 mmHg.
* Neurological: The patient is sedated and has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3.
* Laboratory results: The patient has a white blood cell count of 12.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.8 g/dL, and creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and stabilized on ventilation, but there is a risk of further respiratory deterioration if the patient's condition worsens.
* Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and has undergone cardiac catheterization, which increases the risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
* Infection: The patient has a fever and is receiving antibiotics, which increases the risk of infection. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an infection.
* Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hemodynamics are stable, but there is a risk of further instability if the patient's condition worsens.
* Neurological complications: The patient is sedated and has a GCS of 3, which increases the risk of neurological complications such as brain injury or death.

The plan of care for the patient includes:

* Continue antibiotics and pan-culture to treat the patient's infection.
* Monitor the patient's hemodynamics and adjust therapy as necessary.
* Wean the patient from ventilation as tolerated.
* Diuresis with Lasix prn to manage fluid overload.
* Continue metoprolol and plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize.
* Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust sedation as necessary.
* Trend the patient's laboratory results, including white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine, to monitor for any changes in the patient's condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, NSTEMI, and s/p PCI and thrombectomy of a previously placed LCx stent. The patient is intubated and on ventilator support with minimal changes made overnight. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 102°F this morning.

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC) 12.4-8.4 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb) 10.0 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt) 170-173 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr) 0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T 1.05 ng/mL
* Lactic acid 2.2 mmol/L
* LDH 805 IU/L
* Calcium (Ca++) 8.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++) 2.4 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4) 2.2 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CXR: Stable cardiomegaly without overt pulmonary edema
* TTE: Mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral akinesis with LVEF 40%

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Delirium tremens: Hemodynamics stabilized with intubation and sedation with benzodiazepines
* CAD: Patient s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx
* Fever/leucocytosis: Most likely etiology is PNA, but also concerning for reactive leukocytosis and ACS
* Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash pulmonary edema vs PNA
* Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema
* Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with RBBB when tachycardia
* Anemia: Improved o/n
* Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time
* DM 2: Cover with SSI
* EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Pneumonia (PNA) and reactive leukocytosis, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction
* Flash pulmonary edema, which can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and heart failure
* Anemia, which can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues
* Transaminitis, which can lead to liver dysfunction and potential liver failure
* Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which can occur in patients with DM 2 and can lead to severe metabolic acidosis and organ dysfunction
* Ethanol withdrawal syndrome, which can lead to seizures, hallucinations, and other neurological complications.

Based on the patient's condition, the following interventions are recommended:

* Continue antibiotics for PNA and cover with SSI for DM 2
* Monitor and manage the patient's respiratory status, including weaning from ventilator support and diuresis
* Monitor and manage the patient's cardiac status, including LVEF and pulmonary edema
* Monitor and manage the patient's anemia, including transfusions and erythropoietin therapy
* Monitor and manage the patient's transaminitis, including liver function tests and potential liver transplantation
* Monitor and manage the patient's DM 2, including insulin therapy and glucose monitoring
* Monitor and manage the patient's EtOH withdrawal syndrome, including benzodiazepines and other medications."

   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Continue metoprolol at lower dose of 12.5 mg PO BID.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, NSTEMI, and thrombectomy of a previously placed LCx stent. He remains intubated and ventilated, with a fever of 102°F this morning. His respiratory status is stable, with a RSBI of 86. He has been experiencing delirium tremens, which is being managed with Midazolam and Fentanyl drips. His cardiac status is stable, with a LVEF of 40% on TTE. He has anemia, with a Hct of 29.3%, and transaminitis, with elevated LFTs.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis, despite being on antibiotics, suggest the possibility of sepsis. Broadening antibiotic coverage and repeating cultures may be necessary.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's intubation and ventilation increase his risk of developing VAP. Elevating his head of bed and monitoring for signs of pneumonia are necessary.
3. Flash pulmonary edema: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and pulmonary edema on CXR suggest the possibility of flash pulmonary edema. Monitoring his fluid status and diuresis is necessary.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and NSTEMI increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock. Monitoring his cardiac status and adjusting his medication regimen as necessary is important.
5. Delirium: The patient's delirium tremens and agitation require close monitoring and management with sedatives and antipsychotics.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may require transfusion, especially if his Hct drops below 28.
7. Transaminitis: The patient's elevated LFTs require close monitoring, and further investigation into the etiology of the transaminitis may be necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Repeat BCx, UCx, and sputum cx to rule out pneumonia.
2. Broaden antibiotic coverage and repeat cultures if the patient's fever persists.
3. Monitor the patient's fluid status and diuresis to prevent flash pulmonary edema.
4. Adjust the patient's medication regimen as necessary to manage his cardiac status.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's delirium and adjust his sedation regimen as necessary.
6. Repeat Hct and consider transfusion if the patient's Hct drops below 28.
7. Monitor the patient's LFTs and consider further investigation into the etiology of the transaminitis if the levels persistently elevate."

   Assessment and Plan
 The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent.
   .
   #Delirium tremens: hemodynamics stabilized with intubation and sedation
   with benzos.
   -continue versed gtt titrating to comfort and hemodynamic stability
   -pt may require additional doses of valium to stabilize hemodynamics
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Continue metoprolol at 25 mg PO BID.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily when pressures stable
   .
   # Fever/leucocytosis: most likely etiology is PNA, however also
   concerning for reactive leukocytosis [**2-24**] ACS.  WBC stable.  Plan to
   continue abx as below and pan-culture.  Trend WBC.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stablized on vent.
   - Obtain ABG today
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - Diurese with Lasix prn, goal TBB -500- neg 1 liter today
   - Cover with amp/sulbactam for aspiration event as patient does not
   have any HAP risk factors.
   - Repeat sputum cxs today
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os), goal TBB as above.
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with RBBB when
   tachycardia.  Monitor on tele.

   # Anemia: Improved o/n
   - Trend daily crit
   - Active T+S, transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although AST>ALT
   somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history.  LFTs today
   persistently elevated, will continue to monitor.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old gentleman admitted for respiratory failure and found to have an NSTEMI, s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent. He remains intubated and fully ventilated on AC mode with minimal changes overnight. His vital signs are stable, with a fever of 101.4°F and a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute. His laboratory results show mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral akinesis with an LVEF of 40% on TTE. He has a WBC of 12.4 and a Hct of 35.1%. He is being treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and diuretics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient's fever and leukocytosis are concerning for PNA, and a pan-culture is planned.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and flash pulmonary edema may be indicative of ARDS.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and elevated WBC may be indicative of sepsis.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's LVEF of 40% and pulmonary edema may be indicative of cardiac complications, such as heart failure or cardiogenic shock.
5. Delirium: The patient's agitation and restlessness may be indicative of delirium, and midazolam and fentanyl drips are being used to manage his symptoms.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of EtOH use and transaminitis may be indicative of gastrointestinal complications, such as pancreatitis or liver disease.
7. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance is negative, and he is receiving diuretics to manage his fluid status.
8. Thrombosis: The patient's history of PCI and thrombectomy may be indicative of thrombosis, and anticoagulation therapy is being used to prevent further thrombotic events.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent.
   .
   # Fever/leucocytosis: Pt still febrile despite being on Unasyn for
   presumed aspiration PNA based on initial imaging, but with no
   leukocytosis.   Recent UA markedly positive, but UCx shows no growth to
   date.  Will pan culture again today as pt 102 this morning and broaden
   antibiotic coverage.
   - Repeat BCx, UCx, sputum cx
   - d/c Unasyn
   - Initiate Vanc/Cefepime/Ceftriaxone for double coverage;  if cultures
   negative x48hrs, will d/c Ceftriaxone
   .
   # Delirium tremens: Hemodynamics stabilized with intubation and
   sedation with benzos.  Uptitrated Midazolam overnight in the setting of
   discontinuing prn Valium doses, currently appropriately sedated.
   -Continue Midazolam/Fentanyl gtt, titrating to comfort and hemodynamic
   stability
   -d/c Valium
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Continue metoprolol at lower dose of 12.5 mg PO BID.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily when pressures stable and sedation
   weaned off
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent.
   - CPAP trial; wean vent as tolerated
   - Diurese with Lasix prn, goal TBB even- (-)500 today
   - Cover with antibiotics as above for ?aspiration PNA, as no clinical
   improvement on Unasyn
   - Repeat CXR
   - Repeat sputum cxs today
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os), goal TBB as above.
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with RBBB when
   tachycardia.  Monitor on tele.
   ..
   # Anemia: Hct stable, 35.1-> 29.3 overnight, but was previously stable
   at 29.3, suspect yesterday
s Hct was a spurious result.  Will repeat
   Hct, as no evidence of bleed, will trend daily.
   - Active T+S, transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although AST>ALT
   somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history.  LFTs today
   persistently elevated but essentially stable from yesterday, will
   continue to monitor.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.
   .
   # DM 2: Cover with SSI.
   .
   # EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and I concur
   with the History, Physical, and Medical Decision Making.
   History:  Documented by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9287**]: Documented by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   Medical Decision Making:   Mr. [**Known lastname 4055**] is a 49 year old man who
   developed very late stent thrombosis following placement of two
   overlapping TAXUS stents.  Successful PCI was performed with balloon
   angioplasty alone yesterday.  Right and left heart catheterization
   showed elevated right and left heart pressures with a dilated
   cardiomyopathy and LVEF = 30%.  We have now learned that the
   cardiomyopathy is of longstanding duration.   He has also developed
   acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome that required large dosages of
   benzodiazepidine.
   After an initial period of stabilization, he required re-intubation for
   worsening hypoxemia.   He developed a fever to 102 today and we have
   broadened his antibiotic coverage.   We will continue to rest him today
   on the ventilatory today and aim toward extubation in the AM should his
   condition stabilize.
   We will continue aspirin 325 mg daily indefinitely and Plavix 75 mg
   twice daily for one month, followed by 75 mg daily indefinitely
   thereafter.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and I concur
   with the History, Physical, and Medical Decision Making.
   History:  Documented by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9287**]: Documented by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   Medical Decision Making:   Mr. [**Known lastname 4055**] is a 49 year old man who
   developed very late stent thrombosis following placement of two
   overlapping TAXUS stents.  Successful PCI was performed with balloon
   angioplasty alone yesterday.  Right and left heart catheterization
   showed elevated right and left heart pressures with a dilated
   cardiomyopathy and LVEF = 30%.  We have now learned that the
   cardiomyopathy is of longstanding duration.   He has also developed
   acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome that required large dosages of
   benzodiazepidine.
   After an initial period of stabilization, he required re-intubation for
   worsening hypoxemia.   He developed a fever to 102 today and we have
   broadened his antibiotic coverage.   We will continue to rest him today
   on the ventilatory today and aim toward extubation in the AM should his
   condition stabilize.
   We will continue aspirin 325 mg daily indefinitely and Plavix 75 mg
   twice daily for one month, followed by 75 mg daily indefinitely
   thereafter.

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2, and acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He was admitted for respiratory failure and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with thrombectomy of a previously placed left circumflex (LCx) stent. He developed fever, leucocytosis, and delirium tremens, and was intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient's current status is:

* Fever: 102°F, with a temperature spike this morning
* Leucocytosis: 12.4 K/μL, with a recent UA showing marked positivity
* Delirium tremens: Hemodynamically stable, sedated with midazolam and fentanyl
* CAD: S/p PCI and thrombectomy, with mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral akinesis on TTE
* Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure, stabilized on vent, with a possible diagnosis of flash pulmonary edema vs pneumonia
* Anemia: Hct stable, 35.1% to 29.3% overnight, with a possible false result yesterday
* Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology, with persistently elevated LFTs
* DM 2: Covered with SSI
* EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI

Potential medical complications:

* Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's fever and leucocytosis, there is a possibility of aspiration pneumonia, which may require broadening of antibiotic coverage.
* Flash pulmonary edema: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and pulmonary edema on TTE suggest the possibility of flash pulmonary edema, which may require diuresis and close monitoring.
* Delirium tremens: The patient's delirium tremens may require continued sedation and close monitoring to prevent further complications.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine and BUN levels suggest the possibility of acute kidney injury, which may require close monitoring and possible dialysis.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's transaminitis and elevated LFTs suggest the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding, which may require close monitoring and possible transfusion.
* Infection: The patient's fever and leucocytosis suggest the possibility of infection, which may require broadening of antibiotic coverage and close monitoring."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent.
   .
   # Fever/leucocytosis: Pt still febrile despite being on Unasyn for
   presumed aspiration PNA based on initial imaging, but with no
   leukocytosis.   Recent UA markedly positive, but UCx shows no growth to
   date.  Will pan culture again today as pt 102 this morning and broaden
   antibiotic coverage.
   - Repeat BCx, UCx, sputum cx
   - d/c Unasyn
   - Initiate Vanc/Cefepime/Ceftriaxone for double coverage;  if cultures
   negative x48hrs, will d/c Ceftriaxone
   .
   # Delirium tremens: Hemodynamics stabilized with intubation and
   sedation with benzos.  Uptitrated Midazolam overnight in the setting of
   discontinuing prn Valium doses, currently appropriately sedated.
   -Continue Midazolam/Fentanyl gtt, titrating to comfort and hemodynamic
   stability
   -d/c Valium
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Continue metoprolol at lower dose of 12.5 mg PO BID.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily when pressures stable and sedation
   weaned off
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent.
   - CPAP trial; wean vent as tolerated
   - Diurese with Lasix prn, goal TBB even- (-)500 today
   - Cover with antibiotics as above for ?aspiration PNA, as no clinical
   improvement on Unasyn
   - Repeat CXR
   - Repeat sputum cxs today
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os), goal TBB as above.
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with RBBB when
   tachycardia.  Monitor on tele.
   ..
   # Anemia: Hct stable, 35.1-> 29.3 overnight, but was previously stable
   at 29.3, suspect yesterday
s Hct was a spurious result.  Will repeat
   Hct, as no evidence of bleed, will trend daily.
   - Active T+S, transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although AST>ALT
   somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history.  LFTs today
   persistently elevated but essentially stable from yesterday, will
   continue to monitor.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.
   .
   # DM 2: Cover with SSI.
   .
   # EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of NSTEMI, s/p PCI, and DM 2. The patient has a complex medical history, including CAD, s/p PCI, and DM 2.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Fever: 102.0°F, with no leukocytosis, but with a positive UA and negative UCx.
* Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash pulmonary edema vs PNA, stabilized on vent.
* Delirium tremens: Hemodynamics stabilized with intubation and sedation with benzos.
* CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx, with TTE demonstrating mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral akinesis with LVEF 40%.
* Anemia: Hct stable, but decreased overnight, suspecting a spurious result, will repeat Hct and trend daily.
* Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology, with AST>ALT, will continue to monitor and consider viral serologies if LFTs persistently elevated.
* DM 2: Cover with SSI.
* EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis due to the patient's fever, leukocytosis, and positive UA.
* Respiratory failure due to flash pulmonary edema or PNA.
* Cardiac complications due to CAD, including myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
* Anemia due to blood loss or bone marrow suppression.
* Transaminitis due to EtOH or other causes, which can lead to liver failure.
* Diabetic ketoacidosis due to DM 2 and inadequate insulin control.
* Delirium tremens due to EtOH withdrawal or other causes, which can lead to seizures, coma, or death.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Repeat BCx, UCx, and sputum cx to broaden antibiotic coverage.
* Continue Midazolam and Fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management.
* Continue ASA, Plavix, and atorvastatin for CAD management.
* Continue metoprolol at a lower dose of 12.5 mg PO BID.
* Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily when pressures stable and sedation weaned off.
* Diurese with Lasix prn, goal TBB even-(-)500 today.
* Cover with antibiotics for?aspiration PNA.
* Repeat CXR and sputum cxs today.
* Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os), goal TBB as above.
* Continue to trend LFTs and consider viral serologies if persistently elevated.
* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust medications as necessary.
* Consider starting ACE-I when pressures stabilize.
* Monitor the patient's anemia and transfuse as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
 The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent
   and being managed for EtOH withdrawl
   .
   # Fever/leucocytosis: Abx coverage broadened yesterday, pan cultured
   given fevers over the last 24 hrs.  Sputum showed rare GPCs, otherwise
   no + cxs.
   - follow cxs
   - Continue  Vanc/Cefepime/Ceftriaxone for double coverage;  if cultures
   negative x48hrs, will d/c Ceftriaxone.  Will add flagyl for gram
   coverage out of concern for aspiration event.
   .
   # Delirium tremens: Hemodynamics stabilized with intubation and
   sedation with benzos.  Was able to decrease Midazolam doses o/n.
   -Continue Midazolam/Fentanyl gtt, titrating to comfort and hemodynamic
   stability
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Continue metoprolol at lower dose of 12.5 mg PO BID.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily when pressures stable and sedation
   weaned off
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent.
   - ABG this afternoon, wean vent as tolerated
   - Diurese with Lasix gtt today, goal TBB even- (-)500 today
   - Cover with antibiotics as above for ?aspiration PNA
   - Will re-culture if fevers persist.
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os), goal TBB as above.
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with RBBB when
   tachycardia.  Monitor on tele.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable, 35.1-> 29.3 overnight, but was previously stable
   at 29.3, suspect yesterday
s Hct was a spurious result.  Will repeat
   Hct, as no evidence of bleed, will trend daily.
   - Active T+S, transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although AST>ALT
   somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history.  LFTs today
   persistently elevated but essentially stable from yesterday, will
   continue to monitor.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.

   Medical Decision Making:   Mr. [**Known lastname 4055**] is a 49 year old man who
   developed very late stent thrombosis following placement of two
   overlapping TAXUS stents.  Successful PCI was performed with balloon
   angioplasty alone yesterday.  Right and left heart catheterization
   showed elevated right and left heart pressures with a dilated
   cardiomyopathy and LVEF = 30%.  We have now learned that the
   cardiomyopathy is of longstanding duration.   He has also developed
   acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome that required large dosages of
   benzodiazepidine.
   After an initial period of stabilization, he required re-intubation for
   worsening hypoxemia.  After having been treated for aspiration and
   community acquired pneumonia, he has continued with low grade fevers
   although his WBC remains normal.   We will further broader his
   antibiotic coverage with Flagyl with evidence of ongoing infection.
   We will continue ventilatory support today and push diuresis.  We will
   continue aspirin 325 mg daily indefinitely and Plavix 75 mg twice daily
   for one month, followed by 75 mg daily indefinitely thereafter.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of respiratory failure, NSTEMI, and acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome. He has a significant medical history, including CAD, s/p PCI, and DM 2.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Fever: The patient has had a fever for the past 24 hours, with a temperature of 102.0°F (38.9°C). He has been re-cultured and repeated CXR shows increased opacity at the lung base.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on ventilatory support with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%.
* Cardiac status: The patient has a dilated cardiomyopathy with an LVEF of 40%. He has been treated with Integrillin, ASA, Plavix, and metoprolol.
* Hemodynamics: The patient's hemodynamics are stable, with a blood pressure of 103/67 mmHg and a heart rate of 89 bpm.
* Lab results: The patient's WBC count is 8.4 K/uL, Hct is 29.1%, and platelet count is 173 K/uL. His LFTs are persistently elevated, with an AST of 59 IU/L and an ALT of 67 IU/L.
* Medications: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, and flagyl for gram coverage.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Pneumonia: The patient's fever and increased opacity on CXR suggest the possibility of pneumonia.
* Flash pulmonary edema: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and pulmonary edema on TTE suggest the possibility of flash pulmonary edema.
* Aspiration: The patient's respiratory failure and aspiration of gastric contents may lead to aspiration pneumonia.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's dilated cardiomyopathy and elevated right and left heart pressures may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
* Anemia: The patient's Hct is 29.1%, which is low. He may require transfusion for anemia.
* Transaminitis: The patient's persistently elevated LFTs suggest the possibility of transaminitis, which may be due to EtOH or other causes.
* Delirium tremens: The patient's acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome may lead to delirium tremens.
* DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to his immobilization and medical conditions.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected pneumonia
* Ventilatory support with weaning as tolerated
* Diuresis with Lasix to reduce fluid overload
* Monitoring of volume status and electrolyte levels
* Transfusion for anemia if Hct < 28
* Trending of LFTs to monitor for transaminitis
* Monitoring for cardiac complications and arrhythmias
* Monitoring for delirium tremens and adjusting sedation as needed
* Consideration of flagyl for gram coverage in case of aspiration pneumonia."

   Assessment and Plan
 The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent
   and being managed for EtOH withdrawl
   .
   # Fever/leucocytosis: Abx coverage broadened yesterday, pan cultured
   given fevers over the last 24 hrs.  Sputum showed rare GPCs, otherwise
   no + cxs.
   - follow cxs
   - Continue  Vanc/Cefepime/Ceftriaxone for double coverage;  if cultures
   negative x48hrs, will d/c Ceftriaxone.  Will add flagyl for gram
   coverage out of concern for aspiration event.
   .
   # Delirium tremens: Hemodynamics stabilized with intubation and
   sedation with benzos.  Was able to decrease Midazolam doses o/n.
   -Continue Midazolam/Fentanyl gtt, titrating to comfort and hemodynamic
   stability
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Continue metoprolol at lower dose of 12.5 mg PO BID.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily when pressures stable and sedation
   weaned off
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent.
   - ABG this afternoon, wean vent as tolerated
   - Diurese with Lasix gtt today, goal TBB even- (-)500 today
   - Cover with antibiotics as above for ?aspiration PNA
   - Will re-culture if fevers persist.
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os), goal TBB as above.
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with RBBB when
   tachycardia.  Monitor on tele.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable, 35.1-> 29.3 overnight, but was previously stable
   at 29.3, suspect yesterday
s Hct was a spurious result.  Will repeat
   Hct, as no evidence of bleed, will trend daily.
   - Active T+S, transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although AST>ALT
   somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history.  LFTs today
   persistently elevated but essentially stable from yesterday, will
   continue to monitor.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.
   .
   # DM 2: Cover with SSI.
   .
   # EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   given fevers over the last 24 hrs.  Sputum showed rare GPCs, otherwise
   no + cxs.
   - follow cxs
   - Continue  Vanc/Cefepime/Ceftriaxone for double coverage;  if cultures
   negative x48hrs, will d/c Ceftriaxone.  Will add flagyl for gram
   coverage out of concern for aspiration event.
   .
   # Delirium tremens: Hemodynamics stabilized with intubation and

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, NSTEMI, and EtOH withdrawal. He has a history of CAD, s/p PCI, and DM 2. His current condition includes:

* Fever (102.0°F) and leucocytosis, with broadened antibiotic coverage
* Delirium tremens, managed with sedation and benzodiazepines
* CAD, with mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral akinesis, managed with ASA, Plavix, atorvastatin, and metoprolol
* Respiratory failure, stabilized on ventilation, with concern for flash pulmonary edema or PNA
* Anemia, with a stable Hct of 29.3%, and uncertain etiology
* Transaminitis, with persistently elevated LFTs, possibly related to EtOH
* DM 2, managed with SSI

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory failure and prolonged ventilation make him at risk for developing VAP.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs): The patient's central venous catheters and peripheral IV lines increase his risk for CRBSIs.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's fever and leucocytosis suggest a possible pulmonary infection, which may be complicated by his respiratory failure.
4. Delirium: The patient's delirium tremens may worsen his respiratory status and increase his risk for aspiration.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen his cardiac status and increase his risk for complications related to EtOH withdrawal.
6. Transaminitis: The patient's persistently elevated LFTs may indicate ongoing liver damage, which may complicate his recovery.
7. EtOH withdrawal: The patient's EtOH withdrawal may lead to seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, and other complications.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's CAD and NSTEMI increase his risk for cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for potential pneumonia and sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and wean ventilation as tolerated.
3. Manage the patient's delirium with benzodiazepines and monitor his respiratory status.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusion if his Hct falls below 28%.
5. Trend the patient's LFTs and consider checking viral serologies if his transaminitis persists.
6. Manage the patient's EtOH withdrawal with thiamine, folate, and MVI.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
8. Consider consulting a specialist, such as a cardiologist or a gastroenterologist, to help manage the patient's complex medical condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent.
   .
   # Fever/leucocytosis: Pt still febrile despite being on Unasyn for
   presumed aspiration PNA based on initial imaging, but with no
   leukocytosis.   Recent UA markedly positive, but UCx shows no growth to
   date.  Will pan culture again today as pt 102 this morning and broaden
   antibiotic coverage.
   - Repeat BCx, UCx, sputum cx
   - d/c Unasyn
   - Initiate Vanc/Cefepime/Ceftriaxone for double coverage;  if cultures
   negative x48hrs, will d/c Ceftriaxone
   .
   # Delirium tremens: Hemodynamics stabilized with intubation and
   sedation with benzos.  Uptitrated Midazolam overnight in the setting of
   discontinuing prn Valium doses, currently appropriately sedated.
   -Continue Midazolam/Fentanyl gtt, titrating to comfort and hemodynamic
   stability
   -d/c Valium
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Continue metoprolol at lower dose of 12.5 mg PO BID.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily when pressures stable and sedation
   weaned off
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent.
   - CPAP trial; wean vent as tolerated
   - Diurese with Lasix prn, goal TBB even- (-)500 today
   - Cover with antibiotics as above for ?aspiration PNA, as no clinical
   improvement on Unasyn
   - Repeat CXR
   - Repeat sputum cxs today
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os), goal TBB as above.
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with RBBB when
   tachycardia.  Monitor on tele.
   ..
   # Anemia: Hct stable, 35.1-> 29.3 overnight, but was previously stable
   at 29.3, suspect yesterday
s Hct was a spurious result.  Will repeat
   Hct, as no evidence of bleed, will trend daily.
   - Active T+S, transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although AST>ALT
   somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history.  LFTs today
   persistently elevated but essentially stable from yesterday, will
   continue to monitor.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.
   .
   # DM 2: Cover with SSI.

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), admitted for respiratory failure and found to have an NSTEMI. He underwent a cardiac catheterization and thrombectomy of a previously placed left circumflex (LCx) stent. The patient has developed fever, leukocytosis, and delirium tremens. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's fever and leukocytosis may be related to aspiration pneumonia, which is a common complication in critically ill patients.
2. Septic shock: The patient's fever and leukocytosis may be indicative of septic shock, which can be a life-threatening condition.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory acidosis.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's CAD and recent cardiac catheterization may increase his risk of cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, and heart failure.
5. Delirium tremens: The patient's delirium tremens may worsen if not managed properly, leading to increased agitation, confusion, and potential for falls or other accidents.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and potential for organ dysfunction.
7. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis may be related to his liver disease or other underlying conditions, and may worsen if not managed properly, leading to potential liver failure.
8. Diabetes mellitus type 2: The patient's DM2 may worsen if not managed properly, leading to potential complications such as ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, and nephropathy.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and delirium tremens require immediate attention and management. The patient's respiratory failure and cardiac complications require close monitoring and management. The patient's anemia and transaminitis require further evaluation and management. The patient's DM2 requires close monitoring and management. The patient's EtOH use requires further evaluation and management.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for potential aspiration pneumonia.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
3. Continue to manage the patient's cardiac status, including monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure.
4. Manage the patient's delirium tremens with benzodiazepines and other medications as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and transfuse as necessary.
6. Continue to manage the patient's transaminitis and monitor for potential liver failure.
7. Monitor the patient's DM2 and adjust treatment as necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's EtOH use and provide education on safe drinking habits."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, NSTEMI, and suspected aspiration pneumonia. He has a history of CAD, DM2, and EtOH use. His current status includes:

* Fever (102.0°F) and leucocytosis
* Positive UA, but UCx shows no growth
* NSTEMI with thrombectomy of a previously placed LCx stent
* Respiratory failure with hypoxic respiratory failure and flash pulmonary edema
* Delirium tremens
* Anemia (Hct 29.3%) and transaminitis
* DM2 and EtOH use

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient's fever and leucocytosis persist, suggesting a high risk of aspiration pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leucocytosis, and positive UA increase the risk of sepsis, particularly with the recent thrombectomy and NSTEMI.
3. Flash pulmonary edema: The patient's respiratory failure and hypoxic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further lung damage and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Delirium tremens: The patient's sedation and anesthesia may need to be adjusted to manage his delirium and prevent further complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, potentially leading to further complications, such as cardiovascular instability and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis may be a sign of underlying liver damage, potentially leading to further complications, such as coagulopathy and increased risk of bleeding.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's NSTEMI and thrombectomy may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and heart failure.
8. DVT and VAP: The patient's immobility and respiratory failure increase the risk of DVT and VAP, potentially leading to further complications and prolonged hospitalization.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential aspiration pneumonia and sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely, considering further interventions, such as tracheostomy and lung recruitment maneuvers.
3. Adjust sedation and anesthesia to manage delirium tremens and prevent further complications.
4. Continue diuresis and monitor the patient's volume status to prevent further fluid overload and respiratory failure.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusion if Hct < 28%.
6. Trend LFTs and consider checking viral serologies if transaminitis persists.
7. Consider starting ACE-I and metoprolol as planned, and monitor the patient's cardiac status closely.
8. Implement DVT and VAP prophylaxis measures, such as compression stockings and early mobilization."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent
   and being managed for EtOH withdrawl.
   .
   # Fever: Abx coverage broadened to quadruple coverage, pan-cultured
   given fevers. Sputum showed rare GPCs, otherwise no + cxs. WBC 7.8
   today (overall a downwards trend since admission). Consider drug fever
   versus pneumonia versus other infection versus withdrawal syndrome.
   - follow cxs
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Ceftriaxone/Flagyl;  if cultures negative
   x48hrs, will d/c Ceftriaxone
   - monitor WBC count
   .
   # Delirium tremens: Hemodynamics stabilized with intubation and
   sedation with benzos.  Currently slightly agitated off of
   fentanyl/versed for an hour.
   -Restart, if needed, Midazolam/Fentanyl gtt, titrating to comfort and
   hemodynamic stability
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Continue metoprolol at lower dose of 12.5 mg PO BID.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily when pressures stable and sedation
   weaned off
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent.
   - Wean vent as tolerated today; possibly extubation is looks
   appropriate
   - Diurese with Lasix gtt today, goal: negative 1L to 1.5L today
   - Extra dose of 500 mg IV diuril now to help with diuresis
   - Cover with 4 antibiotics as above for ?aspiration PNA
   - Will re-culture if fevers persist; follow fever curve and WBC count
   - ABG to get a sense for ventilator settings appropriateness
   - SBT this morning
   - CXR post-extubation
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above; goal negative 1 to 1.5L today; via lasix drip and
   one-time diuril dose this AM with repeat PRN
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os)
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with RBBB when
   tachycardic.  Monitor on telemetry.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable, 35.1-> 29.3 overnight, but was previously stable
   at 29.3, suspect yesterday
s Hct was a spurious result.  Will repeat
   Hct, as no evidence of bleed, will trend daily.
   - Active T+S, transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although AST>ALT
   somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.
   .
   # DM 2: Cover with SSI.
   .
   # EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and I
   concur with the History, Physical, and Assessment and Treatment Plan.
   My examination was performed in the present of the housestaff and the
   above note documents this examination.
   History:  Documented by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He was unable to tolerate coming
   off his benzodiazepines due to agitation and his IV sedation was
   reinstituted.  His note writing was somewhat non sensical.  He moves
   all extremities.
   Physical: Documented by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6192**].  He still shows signs of volume
   overload as manifest by his low paO2 = 55 on FIO2 = 40%.
   Medical Decision Making:   Mr. [**Known lastname 4055**] is a 49 year old man who
   developed very late stent thrombosis following placement of two
   overlapping TAXUS stents.  Successful PCI was performed with balloon
   angioplasty alone yesterday.  Right and left heart catheterization
   showed elevated right and left heart pressures with a dilated
   cardiomyopathy and LVEF = 30%.  We have now learned that the
   cardiomyopathy is of longstanding duration.   He has also developed
   acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome that required large dosages of
   benzodiazepidine.
   After an initial period of stabilization, he required re-intubation for
   worsening hypoxemia.  After having been treated for aspiration and
   community acquired pneumonia.  His antibiotic coverage was broadened
   yesterday with the addition of Flagyl.  He continues to spike
   temperatures to 101.5 although his WBC has remained normal.   He did
   not tolerate attempts at weaning the ventilator.  We will continue
   ventilatory support again today and force diuresis.  Our fluid goals
   are negative 1-2 liters daily.
   We will continue aspirin 325 mg daily indefinitely and Plavix 75 mg
   twice daily for one month, followed by 75 mg daily indefinitely
   thereafter.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and I
   concur with the History, Physical, and Assessment and Treatment Plan.
   My examination was performed in the present of the housestaff and the
   above note documents this examination.
   History:  Documented by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He was unable to tolerate coming
   off his benzodiazepines due to agitation and his IV sedation was
   reinstituted.  His note writing was somewhat non sensical.  He moves
   all extremities.
   Physical: Documented by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6192**].  He still shows signs of volume
   overload as manifest by his low paO2 = 55 on FIO2 = 40%.
   Medical Decision Making:   Mr. [**Known lastname 4055**] is a 49 year old man who
   developed very late stent thrombosis following placement of two
   overlapping TAXUS stents.  Successful PCI was performed with balloon
   angioplasty alone yesterday.  Right and left heart catheterization
   showed elevated right and left heart pressures with a dilated
   cardiomyopathy and LVEF = 30%.  We have now learned that the
   cardiomyopathy is of longstanding duration.   He has also developed
   acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome that required large dosages of
   benzodiazepidine.
   After an initial period of stabilization, he required re-intubation for
   worsening hypoxemia.  After having been treated for aspiration and
   community acquired pneumonia.  His antibiotic coverage was broadened
   yesterday with the addition of Flagyl.  He continues to spike
   temperatures to 101.5 although his WBC has remained normal.   He did
   not tolerate attempts at weaning the ventilator.  We will continue
   ventilatory support again today and force diuresis.  Our fluid goals
   are negative 1-2 liters daily.
   We will continue aspirin 325 mg daily indefinitely and Plavix 75 mg
   twice daily for one month, followed by 75 mg daily indefinitely
   thereafter.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male admitted for respiratory failure, found to have an NSTEMI, and is being managed for EtOH withdrawal. The patient has a complex medical history, including CAD, DM2, and recent PCI with thrombectomy of a previously placed LCx stent.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has a fever of 101.3°F and is producing a lot of white sputum. The sputum culture is pending, and the patient is being treated with quadruple antibiotics.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of CAD and has undergone PCI with thrombectomy. He has a dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%. He is receiving aspirin, Plavix, and atorvastatin.
* Hemodynamic: The patient's blood pressure is 111/71 mmHg, and his heart rate is 90 beats per minute. He is receiving vasopressors to maintain blood pressure.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 28 mg/dL.
* Hepatic: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 59 U/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 67 U/L.
* Neurological: The patient is experiencing delirium tremens and is receiving benzodiazepines and fentanyl for sedation.
* Infectious: The patient has a fever and is producing sputum, which is being cultured. He is being treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and ceftriaxone.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture is pending, and he is being treated with antibiotics. If the culture is positive, the patient may develop pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate sepsis. If the patient's condition worsens, he may develop septic shock.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and recent PCI with thrombectomy may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and his BUN level is also elevated. If the patient's kidney function worsens, he may develop renal failure.
5. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may indicate liver damage or failure.
6. Delirium: The patient's delirium tremens may worsen if his sedation is decreased or if he experiences withdrawal symptoms.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if he experiences respiratory acidosis or if his ventilation settings are not optimized.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuing antibiotics and antifungal therapy
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis or organ failure
* Optimizing ventilation settings
* Managing the patient's delirium tremens with benzodiazepines and fentanyl
* Monitoring the patient's cardiac function and adjusting his medication regimen as needed
* Monitoring the patient's renal function and adjusting his fluid management as needed
* Monitoring the patient's liver function and adjusting his medication regimen as needed"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent
   and being managed for EtOH withdrawl.
   .
   # Fever: Abx coverage broadened to quadruple coverage, pan-cultured
   given fevers. Sputum showed rare GPCs, otherwise no + cxs. WBC 7.8
   today (overall a downwards trend since admission). Consider drug fever
   versus pneumonia versus other infection versus withdrawal syndrome.
   - follow cxs
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Ceftriaxone/Flagyl;  if cultures negative
   x48hrs, will d/c Ceftriaxone
   - monitor WBC count
   .
   # Delirium tremens: Hemodynamics stabilized with intubation and
   sedation with benzos.  Currently slightly agitated off of
   fentanyl/versed for an hour.
   -Restart, if needed, Midazolam/Fentanyl gtt, titrating to comfort and
   hemodynamic stability
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Continue metoprolol at lower dose of 12.5 mg PO BID.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily when pressures stable and sedation
   weaned off
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent.
   - Wean vent as tolerated today; possibly extubation is looks
   appropriate
   - Diurese with Lasix gtt today, goal: negative 1L to 1.5L today
   - Extra dose of 500 mg IV diuril now to help with diuresis
   - Cover with 4 antibiotics as above for ?aspiration PNA
   - Will re-culture if fevers persist; follow fever curve and WBC count
   - ABG to get a sense for ventilator settings appropriateness
   - SBT this morning
   - CXR post-extubation
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above; goal negative 1 to 1.5L today; via lasix drip and
   one-time diuril dose this AM with repeat PRN
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os)
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with RBBB when
   tachycardic.  Monitor on telemetry.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable, 35.1-> 29.3 overnight, but was previously stable
   at 29.3, suspect yesterday
s Hct was a spurious result.  Will repeat
   Hct, as no evidence of bleed, will trend daily.
   - Active T+S, transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although AST>ALT
   somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.
   .
   # DM 2: Cover with SSI.
   .
   # EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Radiology: Most recent CXR 10/9/9 - Small bilateral layering pleural
   effusions with mild pulmonary edema are unchanged since the previous
   chest radiograph.
   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent
   and being managed for EtOH withdrawl.
   .
   # Fever: Abx coverage broadened to quadruple coverage, pan-cultured
   given fevers. Sputum showed rare GPCs, otherwise no + cxs. WBC 7.8
   today (overall a downwards trend since admission). Consider drug fever
   versus pneumonia versus other infection versus withdrawal syndrome.
   - follow cxs
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Ceftriaxone/Flagyl;  if cultures negative
   x48hrs, will d/c Ceftriaxone
   - monitor WBC count
   .
   # Delirium tremens: Hemodynamics stabilized with intubation and
   sedation with benzos.  Currently slightly agitated off of
   fentanyl/versed for an hour.
   -Restart, if needed, Midazolam/Fentanyl gtt, titrating to comfort and
   hemodynamic stability
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Continue metoprolol at lower dose of 12.5 mg PO BID.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily when pressures stable and sedation
   weaned off
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent.
   - Wean vent as tolerated today; possibly extubation is looks
   appropriate
   - Diurese with Lasix gtt today, goal: negative 1L to 1.5L today
   - Extra dose of 500 mg IV diuril now to help with diuresis
   - Cover with 4 antibiotics as above for ?aspiration PNA
   - Will re-culture if fevers persist; follow fever curve and WBC count
   - ABG to get a sense for ventilator settings appropriateness
   - SBT this morning
   - CXR post-extubation
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above; goal negative 1 to 1.5L today; via lasix drip and
   one-time diuril dose this AM with repeat PRN
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os)
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with RBBB when
   tachycardic.  Monitor on telemetry.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable, 35.1-> 29.3 overnight, but was previously stable
   at 29.3, suspect yesterday
s Hct was a spurious result.  Will repeat
   Hct, as no evidence of bleed, will trend daily.
   - Active T+S, transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although AST>ALT
   somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.
   .
   # DM 2: Cover with SSI.
   .
   # EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old gentleman with a significant past medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD) with a recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). The patient was admitted for respiratory failure and was found to have an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with thrombosis of the left circumflex (LCx) stent. He is currently being managed for ethanol withdrawal and is intubated.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 101.3°F, heart rate 90 bpm, blood pressure 111/71 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 97%.
* Laboratory results: White blood cell count 7.8 K/uL, hemoglobin 10.4 g/dL, platelet count 197 K/uL, and creatinine 1.4 mg/dL.
* Imaging studies: Chest radiograph shows small bilateral layering pleural effusions with mild pulmonary edema.
* Medications: The patient is receiving a broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen, including vancomycin, cefepime, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole, as well as anticoagulation therapy with heparin and aspirin.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen and fevers, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's chest radiograph shows bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema, which may indicate pneumonia.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy, which may increase the risk of bleeding or cardiac complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and is being managed for respiratory failure, which may require continued ventilatory support.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of ethanol withdrawal and is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis, which may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications.
6. Delirium tremens: The patient is receiving sedation with benzodiazepines and is at risk for developing delirium tremens.
7. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 10.4 g/dL, which may indicate anemia.
8. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, which may indicate transaminitis.
9. Hyperglycemia: The patient has a history of DM2 and is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis, which may increase the risk of hyperglycemia.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should continue to receive close monitoring and management, including:

* Continued antibiotic therapy
* Monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results
* Close monitoring of cardiac and respiratory status
* Management of ethanol withdrawal symptoms
* Monitoring of gastrointestinal function
* Monitoring of liver function
* Monitoring of blood glucose levels
* Adjusting medications as necessary to manage the patient's condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent
   and being managed for EtOH withdrawl.
   .
   # Fever: Abx coverage broadened to quadruple coverage, pan-cultured
   given fevers. Sputum showed rare GPCs, otherwise no + cxs. WBC 7.8
   today (overall a downwards trend since admission). Consider drug fever
   versus pneumonia versus other infection versus withdrawal syndrome.
   - follow cxs
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Ceftriaxone/Flagyl;  if cultures negative
   x48hrs, will d/c Ceftriaxone
   - monitor WBC count
   .
   # Delirium tremens: Hemodynamics stabilized with intubation and
   sedation with benzos.  Currently slightly agitated off of
   fentanyl/versed for an hour.
   -Restart, if needed, Midazolam/Fentanyl gtt, titrating to comfort and
   hemodynamic stability
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Continue metoprolol at lower dose of 12.5 mg PO BID.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily when pressures stable and sedation
   weaned off
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent.
   - Wean vent as tolerated today; possibly extubation is looks
   appropriate
   - Diurese with Lasix gtt today, goal: negative 1L to 1.5L today
   - Extra dose of 500 mg IV diuril now to help with diuresis
   - Cover with 4 antibiotics as above for ?aspiration PNA
   - Will re-culture if fevers persist; follow fever curve and WBC count
   - ABG to get a sense for ventilator settings appropriateness
   - SBT this morning
   - CXR post-extubation
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above; goal negative 1 to 1.5L today; via lasix drip and
   one-time diuril dose this AM with repeat PRN
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os)
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with RBBB when
   tachycardic.  Monitor on telemetry.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable, 35.1-> 29.3 overnight, but was previously stable
   at 29.3, suspect yesterday
s Hct was a spurious result.  Will repeat
   Hct, as no evidence of bleed, will trend daily.
   - Active T+S, transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although AST>ALT
   somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.
   .
   # DM 2: Cover with SSI.
   .
   # EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, NSTEMI, and EtOH withdrawal. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His fever has been managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and his WBC count is trending downwards. He has a history of CAD, DM2, and EtOH use. His current medications include aspirin, Plavix, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and Lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's fever, WBC count, and radiology reports suggest the possibility of pneumonia. The patient's antibiotics may need to be adjusted based on the culture results.
2. Flash Pulmonary Edema: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and pulmonary edema on chest radiograph suggest the possibility of flash pulmonary edema. The patient's diuretic regimen and ventilator settings may need to be adjusted to manage this condition.
3. Delirium Tremens: The patient's agitation and restlessness may be indicative of delirium tremens. His sedation regimen, including fentanyl and Midazolam, may need to be adjusted to manage this condition.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CAD, PCI, and thrombectomy of a previously placed stent may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure. His medications, including aspirin, Plavix, and metoprolol, may need to be adjusted based on his cardiac status.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia, which is not severe, may be related to his EtOH withdrawal or other underlying conditions. His hemoglobin and hematocrit levels will need to be closely monitored.
6. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis, which is characterized by elevated AST and ALT levels, may be related to his EtOH use or other underlying conditions. His liver function tests will need to be closely monitored.
7. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient's DM2 and EtOH use may increase his risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. His blood glucose levels will need to be closely monitored, and his insulin regimen will need to be adjusted as necessary.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. His antibiotics, diuretics, and sedation regimen will need to be adjusted based on his culture results, pulmonary edema, and cardiac status. His anemia, transaminitis, and diabetic ketoacidosis will also need to be closely monitored and managed."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent
   and being managed for EtOH withdrawl.
   .
   # Fever/leucocytosis: Abx coverage broadened to triple coverage,
   pan-cultured given fevers. Sputum showed rare GPCs, otherwise no + cxs.
   - follow cxs
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Ceftriaxone/Flagyl for double coverage;  if
   cultures negative x48hrs, will d/c Ceftriaxone.
   .
   # Delirium tremens: Hemodynamics stabilized with intubation and
   sedation with benzos.  Was able to decrease Midazolam doses o/n.
   -Continue Midazolam/Fentanyl gtt, titrating to comfort and hemodynamic
   stability
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg.
   - Continue metoprolol at lower dose of 12.5 mg PO BID.
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily when pressures stable and sedation
   weaned off
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent.
   - ABG this afternoon, wean vent as tolerated
   - Diurese with Lasix gtt today, goal: even- (-)500 today
   - Cover with antibiotics as above for ?aspiration PNA
   - Will re-culture if fevers persist.
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os), goal TBB as above.
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with RBBB when
   tachycardic.  Monitor on tele.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable, 35.1-> 29.3 overnight, but was previously stable
   at 29.3, suspect yesterday
s Hct was a spurious result.  Will repeat
   Hct, as no evidence of bleed, will trend daily.
   - Active T+S, transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although AST>ALT
   somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history.  LFTs today
   persistently elevated but essentially stable from yesterday, will
   continue to monitor.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.
   .
   # DM 2: Cover with SSI.
   .
   # EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, NSTEMI, and EtOH withdrawal. The patient has a significant medical history, including CAD, DM2, and PCI.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Fever: 101.3°F (38.5°C) with a temperature range of 38.4-38.5°C (101.2-101.3°F) over the past 24 hours.
* Leucocytosis: WBC count of 8.4, with a slight increase from previous values.
* Hemodynamic instability: Blood pressure ranging from 111/71 mmHg to 123/81 mmHg (90/52 mmHg to 89/61 mmHg) over the past 24 hours.
* Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure, stabilized on a ventilator.
* Cardiovascular status: Mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral akinesis with an LVEF of 40% (30% on V-gram).
* Neurological status: Delirium tremens, stabilized with intubation and sedation.

The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Vanc, Cefepime, Ceftriaxone, and Flagyl, for suspected aspiration pneumonia. The patient is also receiving diuretics, including Lasix, to manage fluid overload.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever, leucocytosis, and respiratory failure, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and fevers may indicate the development of pneumonia.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CAD, NSTEMI, and PCI increases the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction.
4. Delirium: The patient's delirium tremens may worsen or persist, leading to increased risk of complications such as aspiration, falls, and medication errors.
5. Kidney injury: The patient's fluid overload and cardiovascular instability may increase the risk of kidney injury or acute kidney injury.
6. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's transaminitis may worsen or persist, leading to increased risk of liver failure.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may worsen or persist, leading to increased risk of respiratory failure and death.

In summary, the patient is at risk of developing various medical complications, including sepsis, pneumonia, cardiovascular complications, delirium, kidney injury, hepatic dysfunction, and respiratory failure. Close monitoring and management of the patient's condition are crucial to prevent or minimize these complications."

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Would check mini-BAL for gram stain and culture.
2. Would obtain neurologic imaging (MRI) to evaluate for underlying neurologic d
isease and possible central etiology of
fevers.
3. Would check amylase, lipase, full set of LFTs to evaluate for pancreatitis an
d for acalculous cholecystitis (and would have a low-threshold for obtaining [**Name (NI) **]
 sono).
4. Consider line changes, given that his lines are approximately 7 days old [**Company 2742**]
his point, although given the time course of his fevers, this is somewhat less l
ikely.
5. Given prolonged NGT, consider sinusitis and sinus CT to rule out sinusitis, a
lthough this seems unlikely given that the fevers have been persistent throughou
t his hospitalization.
6. Given lack of leukocytosis, would strongly consider
non-infectious etiologies as cause of fever. To this end, would pursue work-up f
or possible underlying blood clots. Would also strongly consider not fully treat
ed DTs as the cause of the patient's fever, and would place the patient on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9377**] taper as per guidelines for DTs. Finally, would also consider
drugs as possible underlying cause of fevers, and cultures remain negative, woul
d d/c all antibiotics and observe.
7. Please check stool for C diff.
Highest considerations would be DVT, DTs, drugs, lines, and perhaps central sour
ce given decr MS w/ minimal imaging to date. C. dif possible too, but WBC in
decline. Would consider d/c ABX tomorrow as aspiration has been adequately treat
ed, and drug fevers possible. Continue cxs, and consider changing lines and full
y imaging head.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent
   and being managed for EtOH withdrawl; course complicated by altered
   mental status, re-intubation, and difficulty weaning off the vent
   yesterday (secondary to decreased clearing of secretions and hypoxia).
   .
   # Fever: Fevers persisting, despite being on 4 antibiotics. Sputum
   showed rare GPCs in one sample, otherwise no + cultures. WBC 8.8 today
   (overall a downwards trend since admission; stable for approximately 4
   days now). Consider drug fever versus pneumonia versus other infectious
   source (LFTs elevated but stable/downtrending; altered mental status
   seems sedation-related but could be neurological process; no diarrhea;
   CXR clear; rash does not seem so severe as to be causing these fevers)
   versus withdrawal syndrome.
   - follow cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin (since [**10-31**]) / Cefepime (since [**10-31**]) / Flagyl
   (since [**11-1**])
   - F/U CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Monitor WBC count, fever curve
   - Consider neuro consult and/or repeat CT scan/MRI of head
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent. Diuresed to point where
   lungs sounds clear, CXR looks clear, and Cr bumped
 believe diuresis
   appropriate now. Was 1.6L positive over past 24 hours. Extubated
   yesterday.
   - Goal today: even to -500mL; using lasix PRN to achieve this goal
   - Cover with 3 antibiotics as above for ?aspiration PNA
   - Re-culture if fevers persist; follow fever curve and WBC count
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, metoprolol
   12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily when pressures stable and sedation
   weaned off
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema
 now believe
   fluid overload has resolved.
   - Goal today: even to -500mL; using lasix PRN to achieve this goal
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os)
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with RBBB when
   tachycardic.  Monitor on telemetry.
   .
   # Delirium tremens: Outside of typical window timeframe for DT
s, but
   still a possibility.
   - Monitor mental status
   .
   # Anemia: Hct improved at 34.6 today. No evidence of bleed, will trend
   daily.
   - Transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although previously
   AST>ALT somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history. LFTs
   stable/downtrending over past couple of days.
   - Trend LFTs, if persistently elevated, will check viral serologies.
   - Abdominal CT scan
   .
   # DM 2: Patient hyperglycemic in 200s past 24 hours; increased glargine
   dose this morning.
   - Monitor blood sugars
   .
   # EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 FEVER - 101.9
F - [**2121-11-3**] 08:00 AM (Trange over 24hours:
   99.6-101.9)
   Extubated.
   Feels no fever/chills, no chest pain/pressure. Breathing significantly
   improved. Feels oriented. Denies abdominal pain. Loose stools.
   Dry cough since starting work at a recycling plant (wears a mask but
   doesn
t feel that it fits very well).
   Keen to eat and walk.
   CT head: Motion artifact
 limited study; layering secretions in
   nasopharynx
   CT A/P: pending
   ID consulted:
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Would check mini-BAL for gram stain and culture.
2. Would obtain neurologic imaging (MRI) to evaluate for underlying neurologic d
isease and possible central etiology of
fevers.
3. Would check amylase, lipase, full set of LFTs to evaluate for pancreatitis an
d for acalculous cholecystitis (and would have a low-threshold for obtaining [**Name (NI) **]
 sono).
4. Consider line changes, given that his lines are approximately 7 days old [**Company 2742**]
his point, although given the time course of his fevers, this is somewhat less l
ikely.
5. Given prolonged NGT, consider sinusitis and sinus CT to rule out sinusitis, a
lthough this seems unlikely given that the fevers have been persistent throughou
t his hospitalization.
6. Given lack of leukocytosis, would strongly consider
non-infectious etiologies as cause of fever. To this end, would pursue work-up f
or possible underlying blood clots. Would also strongly consider not fully treat
ed DTs as the cause of the patient's fever, and would place the patient on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9377**] taper as per guidelines for DTs. Finally, would also consider
drugs as possible underlying cause of fevers, and cultures remain negative, woul
d d/c all antibiotics and observe.
7. Please check stool for C diff.
Highest considerations would be DVT, DTs, drugs, lines, and perhaps central sour
ce given decr MS w/ minimal imaging to date. C. dif possible too, but WBC in
decline. Would consider d/c ABX tomorrow as aspiration has been adequately treat
ed, and drug fevers possible. Continue cxs, and consider changing lines and full
y imaging head.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old gentleman with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD) with a recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and thrombus extraction of a stent in the left circumflex (LCx) artery. He is also diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) and has a history of ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal.

The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure and was found to have an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with a thrombus in the LCx artery. He underwent a catheterization procedure, including thrombus extraction, and is currently being managed for EtOH withdrawal.

The patient's current condition is complicated by a persistent fever, despite being on four antibiotics. The fever is not fully explained by the patient's underlying conditions, and the possibility of a drug fever, pneumonia, or other infectious source is being considered. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is trending downwards, which may indicate a resolving infection.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a clear chest X-ray (CXR) and lungs sounds clear. He was recently extubated and is being monitored for signs of respiratory failure.

The patient's cardiac status is also being closely monitored, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40% and mild global hypokinesis on echocardiogram. He is being treated with anticoagulation therapy and is at risk for bleeding.

The patient's dermatological condition is being monitored, with a macular rash on his bilateral axillae, which may be related to contact dermatitis or a fungal infection.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pneumonia: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient's fever persists, and the possibility of pneumonia cannot be ruled out.
2. Drug fever: The patient's fever may be related to a drug reaction or an allergic reaction to one of the medications he is receiving.
3. Central nervous system (CNS) infection: The patient's altered mental status may be related to a CNS infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk for pulmonary embolism due to his recent surgery and immobility.
5. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy increases his risk of bleeding, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract or brain.
6. Wound infection: The patient's recent surgery increases his risk of developing a wound infection.

To address these potential complications, the patient's care team will continue to monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies, and adjust his treatment plan accordingly."

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Would check mini-BAL for gram stain and culture.
2. Would obtain neurologic imaging (MRI) to evaluate for underlying neurologic d
isease and possible central etiology of
fevers.
3. Would check amylase, lipase, full set of LFTs to evaluate for pancreatitis an
d for acalculous cholecystitis (and would have a low-threshold for obtaining [**Name (NI) **]
 sono).
4. Consider line changes, given that his lines are approximately 7 days old [**Company 2742**]
his point, although given the time course of his fevers, this is somewhat less l
ikely.
5. Given prolonged NGT, consider sinusitis and sinus CT to rule out sinusitis, a
lthough this seems unlikely given that the fevers have been persistent throughou
t his hospitalization.
6. Given lack of leukocytosis, would strongly consider
non-infectious etiologies as cause of fever. To this end, would pursue work-up f
or possible underlying blood clots. Would also strongly consider not fully treat
ed DTs as the cause of the patient's fever, and would place the patient on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9377**] taper as per guidelines for DTs. Finally, would also consider
drugs as possible underlying cause of fevers, and cultures remain negative, woul
d d/c all antibiotics and observe.
7. Please check stool for C diff.
Highest considerations would be DVT, DTs, drugs, lines, and perhaps central sour
ce given decr MS w/ minimal imaging to date. C. dif possible too, but WBC in
decline. Would consider d/c ABX tomorrow as aspiration has been adequately treat
ed, and drug fevers possible. Continue cxs, and consider changing lines and full
y imaging head.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent
   and being managed for EtOH withdrawl; course complicated by altered
   mental status, re-intubation, and difficulty weaning off the vent
   yesterday (secondary to decreased clearing of secretions and hypoxia).
   .
   # Fever: Fevers persisting, despite being on 4 antibiotics. Sputum
   showed rare GPCs in one sample, otherwise no + cultures. WBC 8.8 today
   (overall a downwards trend since admission; stable for approximately 4
   days now). Consider drug fever versus pneumonia versus other infectious
   source (LFTs elevated but stable/downtrending; altered mental status
   seems sedation-related but could be neurological process; no diarrhea;
   CXR clear; rash does not seem so severe as to be causing these fevers)
   versus withdrawal syndrome.
   - follow cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin (since [**10-31**]) / Cefepime (since [**10-31**]) / Flagyl
   (since [**11-1**])
   - F/U CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Monitor WBC count, fever curve
   - Consider neuro consult and/or repeat CT scan/MRI of head
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent. Diuresed to point where
   lungs sounds clear, CXR looks clear, and Cr bumped
 believe diuresis
   appropriate now. Was 1.6L positive over past 24 hours. Extubated
   yesterday.

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to NSTEMI, now s/p PCI and thrombectomy. The patient's current condition is complicated by fever, altered mental status, and difficulty weaning off the ventilator.

The patient's fever has persisted despite being on four antibiotics, and the sputum culture showed rare GPCs in one sample. The WBC count has been trending downwards since admission, but the patient's condition remains unstable.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash pulmonary edema vs. PNA. The patient was stabilized on the ventilator and diuresed to the point where lung sounds are clear, and the CXR looks clear.

The patient's cardiac status is also unstable, with mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral akinesis with LVEF 40%. The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy with Integrillin.

The patient's mental status is altered, and the possibility of delirium tremens cannot be ruled out. The patient's dermatological condition is a macular, bilateral axillary rash, which is a concern for contact dermatitis or fungal infection.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated LFTs, which are stable and downtrending over the past couple of days. The patient's blood glucose levels have been in the 200s, and the patient has been receiving insulin therapy.

The patient's fluid status is stable, with a goal of even to -500mL using lasix PRN to achieve this goal. The patient's volume status is being monitored, and the patient is receiving prophylactic anticoagulation therapy with heparin SQ.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated WBC count suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure could worsen, leading to respiratory arrest or failure.
3. Cardiac failure: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and the possibility of cardiac failure cannot be ruled out.
4. Delirium tremens: The patient's altered mental status and history of EtOH withdrawal make it possible for delirium tremens to occur.
5. Infectious complications: The patient's fever and elevated WBC count suggest the possibility of an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis or organ failure.
6. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid status is stable, but the possibility of fluid overload cannot be ruled out, especially if the patient's diuresis is not adequate.
7. Thrombotic complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, but the possibility of thrombotic complications, such as DVT or PE, cannot be ruled out.

In summary, the patient's condition is unstable, and the possibility of various medical complications exists. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Would check mini-BAL for gram stain and culture.
2. Would obtain neurologic imaging (MRI) to evaluate for underlying neurologic d
isease and possible central etiology of
fevers.
3. Would check amylase, lipase, full set of LFTs to evaluate for pancreatitis an
d for acalculous cholecystitis (and would have a low-threshold for obtaining [**Name (NI) **]
 sono).
4. Consider line changes, given that his lines are approximately 7 days old [**Company 2742**]
his point, although given the time course of his fevers, this is somewhat less l
ikely.
5. Given prolonged NGT, consider sinusitis and sinus CT to rule out sinusitis, a
lthough this seems unlikely given that the fevers have been persistent throughou
t his hospitalization.
6. Given lack of leukocytosis, would strongly consider
non-infectious etiologies as cause of fever. To this end, would pursue work-up f
or possible underlying blood clots. Would also strongly consider not fully treat
ed DTs as the cause of the patient's fever, and would place the patient on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9377**] taper as per guidelines for DTs. Finally, would also consider
drugs as possible underlying cause of fevers, and cultures remain negative, woul
d d/c all antibiotics and observe.
7. Please check stool for C diff.
Highest considerations would be DVT, DTs, drugs, lines, and perhaps central sour
ce given decr MS w/ minimal imaging to date. C. dif possible too, but WBC in
decline. Would consider d/c ABX tomorrow as aspiration has been adequately treat
ed, and drug fevers possible. Continue cxs, and consider changing lines and full
y imaging head.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 FEVER - 101.9
F - [**2121-11-3**] 08:00 AM (Trange over 24hours:
   99.6-101.9)
   Extubated.
   Feels no fever/chills, no chest pain/pressure. Breathing significantly
   improved. Feels oriented. Denies abdominal pain. Loose stools.
   Dry cough since starting work at a recycling plant (wears a mask but
   doesn
t feel that it fits very well).
   Keen to eat and walk; very talkative.
   Remembers severe SOB prior to the ambulance.
   CT head: Motion artifact
 limited study; layering secretions in
   nasopharynx
   CT A/P: pending
   ID consulted:
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Would check mini-BAL for gram stain and culture.
2. Would obtain neurologic imaging (MRI) to evaluate for underlying neurologic d
isease and possible central etiology of
fevers.
3. Would check amylase, lipase, full set of LFTs to evaluate for pancreatitis an
d for acalculous cholecystitis (and would have a low-threshold for obtaining [**Name (NI) **]
 sono).
4. Consider line changes, given that his lines are approximately 7 days old [**Company 2742**]
his point, although given the time course of his fevers, this is somewhat less l
ikely.
5. Given prolonged NGT, consider sinusitis and sinus CT to rule out sinusitis, a
lthough this seems unlikely given that the fevers have been persistent throughou
t his hospitalization.
6. Given lack of leukocytosis, would strongly consider
non-infectious etiologies as cause of fever. To this end, would pursue work-up f
or possible underlying blood clots. Would also strongly consider not fully treat
ed DTs as the cause of the patient's fever, and would place the patient on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9377**] taper as per guidelines for DTs. Finally, would also consider
drugs as possible underlying cause of fevers, and cultures remain negative, woul
d d/c all antibiotics and observe.
7. Please check stool for C diff.
Highest considerations would be DVT, DTs, drugs, lines, and perhaps central sour
ce given decr MS w/ minimal imaging to date. C. dif possible too, but WBC in
decline. Would consider d/c ABX tomorrow as aspiration has been adequately treat
ed, and drug fevers possible. Continue cxs, and consider changing lines and full
y imaging head.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent
   and being managed for EtOH withdrawl; course complicated by
   re-intubation, but now extubated (on [**11-3**]) and breathing comfortably.
   .
   # Fever: Fevers persisting, despite being on 4 antibiotics. Sputum
   showed rare GPCs in one sample, otherwise no + cultures. WBC 8.8 today
   (overall a downwards trend since admission; stable for approximately 4
   days now). Consider drug fever versus pneumonia versus other infectious
   source (LFTs elevated but stable/downtrending; altered mental status
   seems sedation-related but could be neurological process; no diarrhea;
   CXR clear; rash does not seem so severe as to be causing these fevers)
   versus withdrawal syndrome.
   - Appreciate & f/u ID recs
   - F/U cultures
   - Discontinue Cefepime, Vancomycin
   - Continue flagyl, but at c.diff dosing, until c.diff negative
   - F/U c.diff test
   - F/U final read CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Monitor WBC count, fever curve

   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent. Diuresed to point where
   lungs sounds clear, CXR looks clear, and Cr bumped
 believe diuresis
   appropriate now. Was 1.6L positive over past 24 hours. Extubated
   yesterday. Significantly improved respiratory status today. Patient
   reports chronic dry cough.
   - Goal today: even to -500mL; using lasix PRN to achieve this goal
   (hopefully in
s shouldn
t be as great, now that d/c
ing multiple IV
   antibiotics)
   - Re-culture if fevers persist; follow fever curve and WBC count;
   re-image lungs if respiratory status changes
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and NSTEMI. He has undergone catheterization and thrombectomy of a previously placed LCx stent. The patient has been extubated and is breathing comfortably, but still has a fever.

The patient's fever has persisted despite being on four antibiotics, and sputum cultures have shown rare GPCs in one sample. The WBC count is trending downwards, but the patient's mental status is still altered, with reports of confusion and repetitive conversation. The patient has a dry cough and is experiencing a macular rash on his axillae.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated LFTs, but they are stable and downtrending. The patient's Hct has improved, but his anemia is still being monitored. The patient's blood sugar levels are being monitored, and he is on a regular diet.

The patient's medical history includes CAD, DM2, and EtOH withdrawal. He is currently on multiple medications, including ASA, Plavix, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and lisinopril.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Infectious etiologies: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient's fever persists, and sputum cultures have shown rare GPCs. The patient's WBC count is trending downwards, but the patient's mental status is still altered. The patient's rash may be a sign of an allergic reaction or an infectious process.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure may be caused by pneumonia, which could be exacerbated by the patient's altered mental status and cough.
3. Central nervous system infection: The patient's altered mental status and confusion could be caused by a central nervous system infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis.
4. Blood clots: The patient's DVT prophylaxis and stress ulcer prophylaxis may need to be adjusted based on the patient's laboratory results and clinical status.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated LFTs may be caused by pancreatitis, which could be exacerbated by the patient's altered mental status and abdominal pain.
6. Cholecystitis: The patient's elevated LFTs and abdominal pain may be caused by cholecystitis, which could be exacerbated by the patient's altered mental status.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's CAD and NSTEMI may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

Based on the patient's laboratory results and clinical status, the following recommendations are made:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's fever curve and WBC count.
2. Re-culture the patient's sputum if the fever persists.
3. Follow up on the patient's LFTs and Hct levels.
4. Monitor the patient's blood sugar levels and adjust the patient's medication regimen as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust the patient's medication regimen as needed.
6. Consider imaging the patient's lungs and abdomen to rule out any underlying infections or inflammatory processes.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust the patient's medication regimen as needed."

   The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent
   and being managed for EtOH withdrawl; course complicated by altered
   mental status, re-intubation, and difficulty weaning off the vent
   yesterday (secondary to decreased clearing of secretions and hypoxia).
   .
   # Fever: Fevers persisting, despite being on 4 antibiotics. Sputum
   showed rare GPCs in one sample, otherwise no + cultures. WBC 8.8 today
   (overall a downwards trend since admission; stable for approximately 4
   days now). Consider drug fever versus pneumonia versus other infectious
   source (LFTs elevated but stable/downtrending; altered mental status
   seems sedation-related but could be neurological process; no diarrhea;
   CXR clear; rash does not seem so severe as to be causing these fevers)
   versus withdrawal syndrome.
   - follow cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin (since [**10-31**]) / Cefepime (since [**10-31**]) / Flagyl
   (since [**11-1**])
   - F/U CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Monitor WBC count, fever curve
   - Consider neuro consult and/or repeat CT scan/MRI of head

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male admitted for respiratory failure, NSTEMI, and EtOH withdrawal. The patient has a complex medical history, including CAD, DM2, and a recent PCI and thrombectomy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Fever: The patient has a persistent fever, despite being on four antibiotics. Sputum cultures are pending, and the patient's WBC count is trending downward.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure, which is concerning for flash pulmonary edema or PNA.
* CAD: The patient has a history of CAD, and recent catheterization and thrombus extraction of a stent in the LCx artery.
* Pump failure: The patient has mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral akinesis with an LVEF of 40%.
* Rhythm: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm with 1:1 conduction and RBBB.
* Delirium tremens: The patient is at risk for delirium tremens due to EtOH withdrawal.
* Anemia: The patient's Hct has improved to 34.6, and there is no evidence of bleeding.
* Transaminitis: The patient's LFTs are stable and downtrending, but the etiology is uncertain.
* DM2: The patient is hyperglycemic and is being treated with increased glargine dosing.
* EtOH: The patient is being treated for EtOH withdrawal with thiamine, folate, and MVI.
* Dermatologic: The patient has a rash that is being treated with miconazole powder application.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever and elevated LFTs make sepsis a possibility.
* Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and hypoxic respiratory failure make pneumonia a concern.
* Flash pulmonary edema: The patient's respiratory failure and hypoxic respiratory failure make flash pulmonary edema a possibility.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of CAD and recent catheterization and thrombus extraction make cardiac arrhythmias a concern.
* Delirium tremens: The patient's EtOH withdrawal and history of CAD make delirium tremens a possibility.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not treated properly.
* Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis may worsen if not treated properly.
* DM2: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen if not treated properly.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing antibiotics for possible pneumonia
* Monitoring WBC count and fever curve
* Considering a neuro consult and/or repeat CT scan/MRI of the head
* Monitoring the patient's mental status and treating for delirium tremens if necessary
* Trending LFTs and checking viral serologies if persistently elevated
* Monitoring the patient's blood sugars and adjusting glargine dosing as necessary
* Applying miconazole powder to the patient's rash and monitoring clinically
* Continuing prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Would check mini-BAL for gram stain and culture.
2. Would obtain neurologic imaging (MRI) to evaluate for underlying neurologic d
isease and possible central etiology of
fevers.
3. Would check amylase, lipase, full set of LFTs to evaluate for pancreatitis an
d for acalculous cholecystitis (and would have a low-threshold for obtaining [**Name (NI) **]
 sono).
4. Consider line changes, given that his lines are approximately 7 days old [**Company 2742**]
his point, although given the time course of his fevers, this is somewhat less l
ikely.
5. Given prolonged NGT, consider sinusitis and sinus CT to rule out sinusitis, a
lthough this seems unlikely given that the fevers have been persistent throughou
t his hospitalization.
6. Given lack of leukocytosis, would strongly consider
non-infectious etiologies as cause of fever. To this end, would pursue work-up f
or possible underlying blood clots. Would also strongly consider not fully treat
ed DTs as the cause of the patient's fever, and would place the patient on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9377**] taper as per guidelines for DTs. Finally, would also consider
drugs as possible underlying cause of fevers, and cultures remain negative, woul
d d/c all antibiotics and observe.
7. Please check stool for C diff.
Highest considerations would be DVT, DTs, drugs, lines, and perhaps central sour
ce given decr MS w/ minimal imaging to date. C. dif possible too, but WBC in
decline. Would consider d/c ABX tomorrow as aspiration has been adequately treat
ed, and drug fevers possible. Continue cxs, and consider changing lines and full

   Labs: CK 2233 (had been trending down from ~[**2112**] to 1600 to 800 and
   then bumped)
   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent
   and being managed for EtOH withdrawl; course complicated by
   re-intubation, but now extubated (on [**11-3**]) and breathing comfortably.
   .
   # Fever: Fevers persisting, despite being on 4 antibiotics. Sputum
   showed rare GPCs in one sample, otherwise no + cultures. WBC 8.8 today
   (overall a downwards trend since admission; stable for approximately 4
   days now). Consider drug fever versus pneumonia versus other infectious
   source (LFTs elevated but stable/downtrending; altered mental status
   seems sedation-related but could be neurological process; no diarrhea;
   CXR clear; rash does not seem so severe as to be causing these fevers)
   versus withdrawal syndrome.
   - Appreciate & f/u ID recs
   - F/U cultures
   - Discontinue Cefepime, Vancomycin
   - Continue flagyl, but at c.diff dosing, until c.diff negative
   - F/U c.diff test
   - F/U final read CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Monitor WBC count, fever curve
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent. Diuresed to point where
   lungs sounds clear, CXR looks clear, and Cr bumped
 believe diuresis
   appropriate now. Was 1.6L positive over past 24 hours. Extubated
   yesterday. Significantly improved respiratory status today. Patient
   reports chronic dry cough.
   - Goal today: even to -500mL; using lasix PRN to achieve this goal
   (hopefully in
s shouldn
t be as great, now that d/c
ing multiple IV
   antibiotics)
   - Re-culture if fevers persist; follow fever curve and WBC count;
   re-image lungs if respiratory status changes
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, metoprolol
   12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily, perhaps tomorrow
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema
 now believe
   fluid overload has resolved.
   - Goal today: even to -500mL; using lasix PRN to achieve this goal
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize
   (perhaps tomorrow)
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os)
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with LBBB when
   tachycardic.  Monitor on telemetry.
   .
   # Mental status: Previously confused, believed to be d/t DT
s, but now
   outside that timeframe window. Still with some confusion (ie: visual,
   seeing a bag that wasn
t there) and also quite repetitive and
   circuitous in conversation (unclear if this is his baseline?)
   - Monitor mental status
   .
   # Anemia: Hct improved at 34.6 today. No evidence of bleed, will trend
   daily.
   - Transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although previously
   AST>ALT somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history. LFTs
   stable/downtrending over past couple of days. No abdominal pain.
   - F/U CT abdomen & pelvis
   - F/U hepatitis viral studies
   - Trend LFTs daily
   .
   # DM 2: Now that patient on regular (heart-healthy) diet, as opposed to
   tube feeds, will monitor blood sugars and adjust medication regimen as
   needed (not on insulin at home).
   - Monitor blood sugars
   .
   # EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.
   .
   # Dermatologic: rash = macular, bilateral axillae
 concern contact
   dermatitis versus fungal
   -miconazole powder application
   -monitor clinically

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and I
   concur with the History, Physical, and Assessment and Treatment Plan.
   My examination was performed in the present of the housestaff and the
   above note documents this examination.
   History:  Documented by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He is now extubated and reasonably
   oriented.
   Physical: Documented by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   Medical Decision Making:   Mr. [**Known lastname 4055**] is a 49 year old man who
   developed very late stent thrombosis following placement of two
   overlapping TAXUS stents.  Successful PCI was performed with balloon
   angioplasty alone yesterday.  Right and left heart catheterization
   showed elevated right and left heart pressures with a dilated
   cardiomyopathy and LVEF = 30%.  We have learned that the cardiomyopathy
   is of longstanding duration.   He has also developed acute alcohol
   withdrawal syndrome that required large dosages of benzodiazepidine.
   After extubation, his fevers seemed to have improved and we are
   reducing his antibiotic regimen given the negative cultures.  He is
   positive yesterday and we are aiming toward being negative today.
   We will continue aspirin 325 mg daily indefinitely and Plavix 75 mg
   twice daily for one month, followed by 75 mg daily indefinitely
   thereafter.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 49 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for CAD
   s/p PCI and DM 2 admitted for respiratory failure found to have an
   NSTEMI, now s/p cath with thrombectomy of previously placed LCx stent
   and being managed for EtOH withdrawl; course complicated by
   re-intubation, but now extubated (on [**11-3**]) and breathing comfortably.
   .
   # Fever: Fevers persisting, despite being on 4 antibiotics. Sputum
   showed rare GPCs in one sample, otherwise no + cultures. WBC 8.8 today
   (overall a downwards trend since admission; stable for approximately 4
   days now). Consider drug fever versus pneumonia versus other infectious
   source (LFTs elevated but stable/downtrending; altered mental status
   seems sedation-related but could be neurological process; no diarrhea;
   CXR clear; rash does not seem so severe as to be causing these fevers)
   versus withdrawal syndrome.
   - Appreciate & f/u ID recs
   - F/U cultures
   - Discontinue Cefepime, Vancomycin
   - Continue flagyl, but at c.diff dosing, until c.diff negative
   - F/U c.diff test
   - F/U final read CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Monitor WBC count, fever curve
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure concerning for flash
   pulmonary edema vs PNA.  Stabilized on vent. Diuresed to point where
   lungs sounds clear, CXR looks clear, and Cr bumped
 believe diuresis
   appropriate now. Was 1.6L positive over past 24 hours. Extubated
   yesterday. Significantly improved respiratory status today. Patient
   reports chronic dry cough.
   - Goal today: even to -500mL; using lasix PRN to achieve this goal
   (hopefully in
s shouldn
t be as great, now that d/c
ing multiple IV
   antibiotics)
   - Re-culture if fevers persist; follow fever curve and WBC count;
   re-image lungs if respiratory status changes
   .
   # CAD: Patient now s/p PTCA and thrombus extraction of stent in LCx.
   TTE demonstrates mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral
   akinesis with LVEF 40%, although V-gram suggests 30%.  Given
   Integrillin x18 hours following cath.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg, plavix 75 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, metoprolol
   12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Resume home lisinopril 10 mg daily, perhaps tomorrow
   .
   # Pump: TTE today with LVEF 40% with pulmonary edema
 now believe
   fluid overload has resolved.
   - Goal today: even to -500mL; using lasix PRN to achieve this goal
   - Metoprolol as above, plan to start ACE-I when pressures stabilize
   (perhaps tomorrow)
   - Monitor volume status (UOP, I/Os)
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently sinus with 1:1 conduction with LBBB when
   tachycardic.  Monitor on telemetry.
   .
   # Mental status: Previously confused, believed to be d/t DT
s, but now
   outside that timeframe window. Still with some confusion (ie: visual,
   seeing a bag that wasn
t there) and also quite repetitive and
   circuitous in conversation (unclear if this is his baseline?)
   - Monitor mental status
   .
   # Anemia: Hct improved at 34.6 today. No evidence of bleed, will trend
   daily.
   - Transfuse for hct<28 given ACS.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Uncertain etiology at this time, although previously
   AST>ALT somewhat concerning for EtOH given social history. LFTs
   stable/downtrending over past couple of days. No abdominal pain.
   - F/U CT abdomen & pelvis
   - F/U hepatitis viral studies
   - Trend LFTs daily
   .
   # DM 2: Now that patient on regular (heart-healthy) diet, as opposed to
   tube feeds, will monitor blood sugars and adjust medication regimen as
   needed (not on insulin at home).
   - Monitor blood sugars
   .
   # EtOH: Thiamine, folate, MVI.

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and I
   concur with the History, Physical, and Assessment and Treatment Plan.
   My examination was performed in the present of the housestaff and the
   above note documents this examination.
   History:  Documented by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He is now extubated and reasonably
   oriented.
   Physical: Documented by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   Medical Decision Making:   Mr. [**Known lastname 4055**] is a 49 year old man who
   developed very late stent thrombosis following placement of two
   overlapping TAXUS stents.  Successful PCI was performed with balloon
   angioplasty alone yesterday.  Right and left heart catheterization
   showed elevated right and left heart pressures with a dilated
   cardiomyopathy and LVEF = 30%.  We have learned that the cardiomyopathy
   is of longstanding duration.   He has also developed acute alcohol
   withdrawal syndrome that required large dosages of benzodiazepidine.
   After extubation, his fevers seemed to have improved and we are
   reducing his antibiotic regimen given the negative cultures.  He is
   positive yesterday and we are aiming toward being negative today.
   We will continue aspirin 325 mg daily indefinitely and Plavix 75 mg
   twice daily for one month, followed by 75 mg daily indefinitely
   thereafter.

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old man who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and was found to have an NSTEMI. He underwent PCI with thrombectomy of a previously placed LCx stent and is being managed for EtOH withdrawal. He has been extubated and is breathing comfortably. Despite being on four antibiotics, his fevers persist, and his WBC count is trending downward. He has a history of CAD, DM2, and EtOH use.

Potential medical complications:

1. Infection: The patient's fevers and WBC count suggest that he may have an underlying infection, which could be caused by pneumonia, sepsis, or another source.
2. Drug fever: The patient's antibiotic regimen has been reduced, and he is being monitored for signs of a drug fever.
3. Central nervous system (CNS) infection: The patient's altered mental status and rash could be indicative of a CNS infection.
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and rash could be caused by a PE.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's LVEF is 40%, and he has a history of CAD and DM2, which could increase his risk of cardiac complications.
6. Gastrointestinal (GI) complications: The patient's elevated LFTs and abdominal pain could be indicative of GI complications.
7. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels could indicate renal failure.
8. Sepsis: The patient's fever, WBC count, and altered mental status could be indicative of sepsis.
9. Pulmonary edema: The patient's respiratory failure and hypoxic respiratory failure could be caused by pulmonary edema.
10. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's LBBB and tachycardia could be indicative of cardiac arrhythmias.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's fevers, WBC count, and mental status.
2. Re-culture the patient's blood and respiratory secretions if his fevers persist.
3. Consider imaging the patient's lungs and abdomen to rule out pneumonia and other causes of his respiratory failure.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider adjusting his medication regimen as needed.
5. Consider transferring the patient to a step-down unit or a medical ward if his condition improves.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's GI status and consider adjusting his medication regimen as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider adjusting his medication regimen as needed.
8. Consider transferring the patient to a step-down unit or a medical ward if his condition improves.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Would check mini-BAL for gram stain and culture.
2. Would obtain neurologic imaging (MRI) to evaluate for underlying neurologic d
isease and possible central etiology of
fevers.
3. Would check amylase, lipase, full set of LFTs to evaluate for pancreatitis an
d for acalculous cholecystitis (and would have a low-threshold for obtaining [**Name (NI) **]
 sono).
4. Consider line changes, given that his lines are approximately 7 days old [**Company 2742**]
his point, although given the time course of his fevers, this is somewhat less l
ikely.
5. Given prolonged NGT, consider sinusitis and sinus CT to rule out sinusitis, a
lthough this seems unlikely given that the fevers have been persistent throughou
t his hospitalization.
6. Given lack of leukocytosis, would strongly consider
non-infectious etiologies as cause of fever. To this end, would pursue work-up f
or possible underlying blood clots. Would also strongly consider not fully treat
ed DTs as the cause of the patient's fever, and would place the patient on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9377**] taper as per guidelines for DTs. Finally, would also consider
drugs as possible underlying cause of fevers, and cultures remain negative, woul
d d/c all antibiotics and observe.
7. Please check stool for C diff.
Highest considerations would be DVT, DTs, drugs, lines, and perhaps central sour
ce given decr MS w/ minimal imaging to date. C. dif possible too, but WBC in
decline. Would consider d/c ABX tomorrow as aspiration has been adequately treat
ed, and drug fevers possible. Continue cxs, and consider changing lines and full
y imaging head.

   # Fever: Fevers persisting, despite being on 4 antibiotics. Sputum
   showed rare GPCs in one sample, otherwise no + cultures. WBC 8.8 today
   (overall a downwards trend since admission; stable for approximately 4
   days now). Consider drug fever versus pneumonia versus other infectious

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and I
   concur with the History, Physical, and Assessment and Treatment Plan.
   My examination was performed in the present of the housestaff and the
   above note documents this examination.
   History:  Documented by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He is now extubated and reasonably
   oriented.
   Physical: Documented by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   Medical Decision Making:   Mr. [**Known lastname 4055**] is a 49 year old man who
   developed very late stent thrombosis following placement of two
   overlapping TAXUS stents.  Successful PCI was performed with balloon
   angioplasty alone yesterday.  Right and left heart catheterization
   showed elevated right and left heart pressures with a dilated
   cardiomyopathy and LVEF = 30%.  We have learned that the cardiomyopathy
   is of longstanding duration.   He has also developed acute alcohol
   withdrawal syndrome that required large dosages of benzodiazepidine.
   After extubation, his fevers seemed to have improved and we are
   reducing his antibiotic regimen given the negative cultures.  He is
   positive yesterday and we are aiming toward being negative today.
   We will continue aspirin 325 mg daily indefinitely and Plavix 75 mg
   twice daily for one month, followed by 75 mg daily indefinitely
   thereafter.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 BAL FLUID CULTURE - At [**2121-11-3**] 12:37 PM
   mini BAL
 FEVER - 101.9
F - [**2121-11-3**] 08:00 AM (Trange over 24hours:
   99.6-101.9)
   Extubated.
   Feels no fever/chills, no chest pain/pressure. Breathing significantly
   improved. Feels oriented. Denies abdominal pain. Loose stools.
   Dry cough since starting work at a recycling plant (wears a mask but
   doesn
t feel that it fits very well).
   Keen to eat and walk; very talkative.
   Remembers severe SOB prior to the ambulance.
   CT head: Motion artifact
 limited study; layering secretions in
   nasopharynx
   CT A/P: pending
   ID consulted:
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Would check mini-BAL for gram stain and culture.
2. Would obtain neurologic imaging (MRI) to evaluate for underlying neurologic d
isease and possible central etiology of
fevers.
3. Would check amylase, lipase, full set of LFTs to evaluate for pancreatitis an
d for acalculous cholecystitis (and would have a low-threshold for obtaining [**Name (NI) **]
 sono).
4. Consider line changes, given that his lines are approximately 7 days old [**Company 2742**]
his point, although given the time course of his fevers, this is somewhat less l
ikely.
5. Given prolonged NGT, consider sinusitis and sinus CT to rule out sinusitis, a
lthough this seems unlikely given that the fevers have been persistent throughou
t his hospitalization.
6. Given lack of leukocytosis, would strongly consider
non-infectious etiologies as cause of fever. To this end, would pursue work-up f
or possible underlying blood clots. Would also strongly consider not fully treat
ed DTs as the cause of the patient's fever, and would place the patient on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9377**] taper as per guidelines for DTs. Finally, would also consider
drugs as possible underlying cause of fevers, and cultures remain negative, woul
d d/c all antibiotics and observe.
7. Please check stool for C diff.
Highest considerations would be DVT, DTs, drugs, lines, and perhaps central sour
ce given decr MS w/ minimal imaging to date. C. dif possible too, but WBC in
decline. Would consider d/c ABX tomorrow as aspiration has been adequately treat
ed, and drug fevers possible. Continue cxs, and consider changing lines and full
y imaging head.

   angioplasty alone yesterday.  Right and left heart catheterization
   showed elevated right and left heart pressures with a dilated
   cardiomyopathy and LVEF = 30%.  We have learned that the cardiomyopathy
   is of longstanding duration.   He has also developed acute alcohol
   withdrawal syndrome that required large dosages of benzodiazepidine.
   After extubation, his fevers seemed to have improved and we are
   reducing his antibiotic regimen given the negative cultures.  He is
   positive yesterday and we are aiming toward being negative today.
   We will continue aspirin 325 mg daily indefinitely and Plavix 75 mg
   twice daily for one month, followed by 75 mg daily indefinitely
   thereafter.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old man admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, NSTEMI, and EtOH withdrawal. He has undergone PCI with thrombectomy of a previously placed LCx stent and is currently managed for EtOH withdrawal.

The patient's fever persists despite being on four antibiotics, and the sputum culture showed rare GPCs in one sample. The WBC count is stable and trending downwards. The patient's mental status is still confused, and he has some visual hallucinations.

The patient's respiratory status has improved significantly since extubation, and he is breathing comfortably. His chest X-ray is clear, and his lung sounds are clear.

The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a LVEF of 40% and pulmonary edema. His cardiac rhythm is sinus with 1:1 conduction with LBBB when tachycardic.

The patient's anemia has improved, and his Hct is 34.6. His transaminitis is stable and downtrending, and his liver function tests are stable.

The patient's DM2 is being managed with a regular diet, and his blood sugars are being monitored. His EtOH withdrawal is being managed with thiamine, folate, and MVI.

The patient's dermatologic condition is a macular rash in his axillae, which is being treated with miconazole powder.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's fever persists despite being on antibiotics, and there is a risk of developing a new infection.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status has improved, but there is still a risk of developing pneumonia.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but there is still a risk of developing cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's mental status is still confused, and there is a risk of developing neurological complications such as seizures or stroke.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's transaminitis is stable, but there is still a risk of developing gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding or perforation.
6. Dermatological complications: The patient's rash is being treated, but there is still a risk of developing dermatological complications such as infection or allergic reactions.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia has improved, but there is still a risk of developing anemia or worsening of his anemia.
8. Diabetes: The patient's DM2 is being managed, but there is still a risk of developing complications such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's fever and adjust his antibiotic regimen as necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his oxygen therapy as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust his transfusion regimen as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's DM2 and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's dermatologic condition and adjust his treatment regimen as necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.

I recommend that the patient continue to receive close monitoring and treatment in the ICU to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, NSTEMI, and ethanol withdrawal. He has undergone PCI with thrombectomy of a previously placed LCx stent and is currently extubated. The patient's fever is being monitored, and the differential diagnosis includes fever as part of withdrawal syndrome, drug fever, or aspiration pneumonia. He has been diuresed to improve his respiratory status, and his Cr has returned to baseline. The patient has mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral akinesis with an LVEF of 40%. He has been started on ASA, Plavix, Atorvastatin, and Metoprolol, and his Lisinopril has been resumed. The patient's mental status has improved since extubation, but he is being monitored for benzodiazepine withdrawal. His Hct has improved, and his LFTs are stable/downtrending. He is being monitored for blood sugars and adjusting his medication regimen as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pneumonia.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral akinesis with an LVEF of 40% may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock.
3. Infection: The patient's fever and pulmonary infiltrates may indicate an infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload may lead to respiratory failure, cardiac failure, or kidney injury.
5. Benzodiazepine withdrawal: The patient's benzodiazepine withdrawal may lead to seizures, agitation, or other withdrawal symptoms.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, or other symptoms.
7. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis may worsen, leading to liver damage or failure.
8. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient's ethanol withdrawal may lead to seizures, hallucinations, or other withdrawal symptoms.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely for signs of respiratory failure or pneumonia.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely for signs of cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Monitor the patient's fluid status closely to prevent fluid overload.
4. Monitor the patient's mental status closely for signs of benzodiazepine withdrawal or other withdrawal symptoms.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and transaminitis closely for signs of worsening.
6. Monitor the patient's ethanol withdrawal closely for signs of seizures, hallucinations, or other withdrawal symptoms.
7. Consider adjusting the patient's medication regimen as needed to manage his symptoms and prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM 2), and alcohol abuse, admitted for respiratory failure and NSTEMI. He underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and thrombectomy of a previously placed left circumflex (LCx) stent. The patient is currently being managed for ethanol withdrawal and is extubated. He has a fever, hypoxic respiratory failure, and is at risk for flash pulmonary edema and pneumonia.

Medical Complications:

1. Fever: The patient's fever is concerning, and it is unclear whether it is related to ethanol withdrawal, drug fever, or aspiration pneumonia. The patient's WBC count is downtrending, but it is still elevated. Further monitoring and cultures are needed to determine the cause of the fever.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure, which is concerning for flash pulmonary edema or pneumonia. The patient has been diuresed, and his lung sounds are clear. However, he still requires close monitoring for respiratory status changes.
3. CAD: The patient's CAD is stable, and he is being managed with aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin. His LVEF is 40%, and he has mild global hypokinesis and basal inferolateral akinesis.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis, which is unclear in etiology. His liver function tests (LFTs) are stable and downtrending, and he has a fatty liver on abdominal CT. Hepatitis viral studies are negative, and the patient's transaminitis is believed to be related to fatty liver.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is improving, and he is being monitored daily. He may require transfusion if his Hct falls below 28.
6. DM 2: The patient's DM 2 is being managed with a regular diet, and his blood sugars are being monitored. His glargine dose has been increased, and he may require further adjustments to his medication regimen.
7. EtOH Withdrawal: The patient is being managed for ethanol withdrawal, and he is at risk for benzodiazepine withdrawal given his history of benzodiazepine use.
8. Dermatologic: The patient has a rash in his axillae, which is improving with miconazole powder application.

Action Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's fever and WBC count, and consider re-culturing if fevers persist.
2. Continue to diuresed the patient to achieve a negative fluid balance, and monitor his lung sounds and CXR for any changes.
3. Continue to manage the patient's CAD with aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin, and monitor his LVEF and cardiac function.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's transaminitis, and consider following up with a hepatologist as an outpatient.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia, and consider transfusing if his Hct falls below 28.
6. Continue to manage the patient's DM 2 with a regular diet, and monitor his blood sugars.
7. Continue to manage the patient's ethanol withdrawal, and monitor him for benzodiazepine withdrawal.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's dermatologic condition, and consider following up with a dermatologist as an outpatient.

ICU Care:

1. Nutrition: The patient will receive a regular, heart-healthy diet.
2. Glycemic Control: The patient will receive SSI, and a consult has been given to [**Last Name (un) 72**] for high sugars and large insulin requirement.
3. Lines: The patient has a 20-gauge line, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP will be continued.
4. Communication: The patient's parents will be updated on his condition.
5. Code status: The patient's code status is full code.
6. Disposition: The patient will be transferred to the step-down unit on the floor today."
