   Assessment and Plan
 RETROPERITONEAL BLEED (RP BLEED), SPONTANEOUS
   67M w/St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] mechanical aortic valve admitted [**Date range (3) 12204**] for
   subtherapeutic INR now on lovenox bridge and coumadin who presents with
   2 days of low back pain and found to have retroperitoneal hematoma in
   setting of 8 point hct drop.
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL BLEED. Retroperitoneal bleed found on CT torso
   w/contrast; 8 point Hct drop; systolics in 70s; on [**5-15**] received 2
   units FFP and 2 units pRBCs, 3.2L IVF in ED, more IVF on floor. On
   floor systolics in 100s (baseline 140s even on antihypertensives); HR
   in 80s. Hct 39.2 on [**5-9**] -> 31.4 at 12pm -> 25.5 at 3pm -> 26.6 at 6pm
   (during second unit pRBC). Etiology for bleed unclear; appears
   spontaneous in setting of supratherapeutic INR and lovenox bridge. CT
   negative for dissection; no history of trauma or recent intravascular
   manipulation/procedures.
   - Maintain active type and screen, 2 large bore PIV, 2 units crossed in
   blood bank
   - Hct q4h, transfuse for Hct > 25
   - Vascular surgery following: appreciate recs - for now will defer to
   IR
   - IR following; will not intervene without INR < 2. Overnight pt still
   bleeding despite INR < 2, pt to angio but no active extravasation seen.
   IR will follow.
   - Hold home ASA/coumadin/lovenox, hold antihypertensives
   - Monitor UOP and I/Os and pressures; IVF or blood products for MAP <
   65 or UOP < 30 cc/hr
   - Monitor bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome in
   setting of distention (initially 21), elevated lactate, decreased UOP.
   - Trend lactate
   - General surgery following for increased abdominal pressure:
   appreciate recs - ?angio for embolization (unsigned note)
   - Morphine for abdominal pain but watch blood pressures
   - Transfuse Plts if < 50
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   # COAGULOPATHY/MECHANICAL VALVE. St. Jude's valve in aortic position,
   pt on coumadin with lovenox bridge. INR slightly supratherapeutic at
   4.2 on admission (goal 2.5-3.5). [**5-16**] INR decreased to 2.0 s/p 4 units
   FFP.
   - Ordered for 2 more units FFP (for total of 6 by [**5-16**] by 7am)
   - Hold coumadin/lovenox in setting of bleed
   - Cardiology recommended initially holding vitamin K but given
   continued bleeding, gave 5 mg [**5-16**] AM
   - Monitor coags q4 hours
   - Check fibrinogen [**Hospital1 **] (wnl thus far)
   - Will restart heparin with goal PTT 60-80 without bolus when INR < 2.0
   and Hct stable X 24 hours without transfusions
   - Continue home dicloxacillin for endocarditis prophylaxis
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. Creatinine 1.7 on admission. Received contrast
   for CT torso with prophylactic bicarb prior to procedure. Contrast
   again for angio, got NAC/bicarb.  Likely prerenal etiology in setting
   of hypovolemia/bleed despite large volume resuscitation; bladder scan
   on admission to MICU with only 50 cc urine. FeNa 0.3% (on diuretics),
   Na 45. Foley in place by urology. Urinalysis benign (neg nitrite,
   leuks; though occ bact on sediment). Low urine output overnight despite
   fluids/blood products.
   - Hold home lisinopril
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Monitor UOP, I/O. IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr.
   - Monitor bladder pressures to rule out abdominal compartment syndrome
   - Follow urine culture (pending)
   .
   # ARRHYTHMIA/ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. s/p PMP in [**2139**] in setting of CHB.
   Pt with WCT, paced, to 100s-120s overnight [**5-15**]. In and out of sinus
   rhythm with HR 70s-80s. Unclear why pacer is pacing a tachycardic
   rhythm.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Hold home metoprolol in setting of active bleeding/hypovolemia
   - Consider EP consult if tachycardia increases.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS. Possibly related to bleeding, multiple transfusions.
   - Trend WBC, monitor temperature, CIS.
   - Follow urine culture (pending)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG.
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes in setting of bleed; first two sets negative
   - Hold ASA in setting of active bleeding
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - Continue simvastatin
   .
   # HYPERTENSION
   - Hold home lisinopril, metoprolol, HCTZ in setting of active bleeding.
   .
   # COPD
   - Continue home atrovent prn
   .
   # HISTORY OF GIB
   - Continue home omeprazole
   - Hold home iron until taking POs
   .
   # FEN: pRBCs/IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO except meds in setting of
   active bleeding; senna prn when taking POs
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (hold anticoagulation in setting of bleed)
   # Access: 2 PIV

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve who was admitted for subtherapeutic INR. He presented with 2 days of low back pain and was found to have a retroperitoneal hematoma. The patient has undergone multiple transfusions, including 5 units of packed red blood cells and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma, and has received IV fluids and blood products.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.1°C (98.7°F)
* Heart rate: 77 bpm (64-113 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 92/49 mmHg (60/90 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 193 x 10^9/L
* White blood cell count: 10.9 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.7 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 27 mg/dL
* Sodium: 141 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.4 mEq/L
* Calcium: 7.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.9 mg/dL

The patient's condition is complicated by several medical issues, including:

1. Retroperitoneal bleed: The patient has a spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma, which is likely related to his mechanical aortic valve and supratherapeutic INR.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has a supratherapeutic INR, which is being managed with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has a creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL and is receiving IV fluids and blood products.
4. Arrhythmia: The patient has a paced rhythm with a heart rate of 100s-120s, which is unclear why the pacemaker is pacing a tachycardic rhythm.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has a white blood cell count of 10.9 x 10^9/L, which may be related to bleeding and multiple transfusions.
6. CAD: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting.
7. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient has a history of hypercholesterolemia and is receiving simvastatin.
8. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is receiving antihypertensive medications.

The patient is being managed with the following medications:

* Lovenox bridge
* Coumadin
* Amiodarone
* Morphine
* Fentanyl
* Lorazepam
* Simvastatin
* Metoprolol
* Lisinopril
* HCTZ
* Omeprazole
* Iron

The patient's plan is to continue to receive IV fluids and blood products, as well as medications to manage his coagulopathy, arrhythmia, and other medical issues. He will be closely monitored for signs of bleeding, infection, and other complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed) and multiple comorbidities. The patient has a mechanical aortic valve and was taking coumadin with a lovenox bridge. He presented with 2 days of low back pain and was found to have a retroperitoneal hematoma.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T = 97.4°F, HR = 77 bpm, BP = 92/49 mmHg, RR = 13 insp/min, SpO2 = 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: MAP < 65, UOP < 30 cc/hr, and pressures are holding
* Laboratory results: Hct = 26.6%, platelets = 193 K/uL, Cr = 1.6 mg/dL, Glucose = 144 mg/dL, INR = 2.0
* Imaging studies: CT torso with contrast shows a retroperitoneal bleed, no dissection, and no history of trauma or recent intravascular manipulation/procedures

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient is still bleeding despite INR < 2.0, and further bleeding can lead to hypovolemic shock, organ failure, and death.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine is 1.7 mg/dL, and he has received contrast for CT and angiography. Further kidney damage can lead to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a mechanical aortic valve and was taking coumadin with a lovenox bridge. He is currently on heparin with a goal PTT 60-80 without bolus. Further bleeding or coagulopathy can lead to hemorrhagic complications.
4. Arrhythmia: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently paced. Further arrhythmia can lead to cardiac complications.
5. Sepsis: The patient has a Foley catheter and is receiving multiple blood products, which can increase the risk of sepsis.
6. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient has a retroperitoneal bleed and is receiving large volumes of IV fluids, which can increase the risk of abdominal compartment syndrome.
7. Pulmonary complications: The patient has a history of COPD and is receiving oxygen therapy. Further pulmonary complications can lead to respiratory failure.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Maintaining active type and screen, 2 large bore PIV, and 2 units crossed in blood bank
2. Hct q4h, transfusing for Hct > 25, and platelets < 50 in setting of active bleeding
3. Holding home ASA/coumadin/lovenox, holding antihypertensives, and monitoring UOP and I/Os and pressures
4. Monitoring bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome in setting of distention (initially 21), elevated lactate, and decreased UOP
5. Trending lactate and following urine culture (pending)
6. Continuing amiodarone, holding home metoprolol, and considering EP consult if tachycardia increases
7. Trending WBC, monitoring temperature, and CIS
8. Following urine culture (pending) and monitoring for signs of sepsis
9. Continuously monitoring the patient's condition and adjusting the plan of care as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 RETROPERITONEAL BLEED (RP BLEED), SPONTANEOUS
   67M w/St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] mechanical aortic valve admitted [**Date range (3) 12204**] for
   subtherapeutic INR now on lovenox bridge and coumadin who presents with
   2 days of low back pain and found to have retroperitoneal hematoma in
   setting of 8 point hct drop.
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL BLEED. Retroperitoneal bleed found on CT torso
   w/contrast; 8 point Hct drop; systolics in 70s; on [**5-15**] received 2
   units FFP and 2 units pRBCs, 3.2L IVF in ED, more IVF on floor. On
   floor systolics in 100s (baseline 140s even on antihypertensives); HR
   in 80s. Hct 39.2 on [**5-9**] -> 31.4 at 12pm -> 25.5 at 3pm -> 26.6 at 6pm
   (during second unit pRBC). Etiology for bleed unclear; appears
   spontaneous in setting of supratherapeutic INR and lovenox bridge. CT
   negative for dissection; no history of trauma or recent intravascular
   manipulation/procedures.
   - Maintain active type and screen, 2 large bore PIV, 2 units crossed in
   blood bank
   - Hct q4h, transfuse for Hct > 25; platelets < 50 in setting of active
   bleeding
   - Hold home ASA/coumadin/lovenox, hold antihypertensives
   - Monitor UOP and I/Os and pressures; IVF or blood products for MAP <
   65 or UOP < 30 cc/hr
   - Monitor bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome in
   setting of distention (initially 21), elevated lactate, decreased UOP.
   - Trend lactate
   - General surgery following for increased abdominal pressure:
   appreciate recs - ?angio for embolization (unsigned note)
   - Vascular surgery following: appreciate recs - for now will defer to
   IR
   - IR following; will not intervene without INR < 2. Overnight pt still
   bleeding despite INR < 2, pt to angio but no active extravasation seen.
   IR will follow.
   - Morphine for abdominal pain but watch blood pressures
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   # COAGULOPATHY/MECHANICAL VALVE. St. Jude's valve in aortic position,
   pt on coumadin with lovenox bridge. INR slightly supratherapeutic at
   4.2 on admission (goal 2.5-3.5). [**5-16**] INR decreased to 2.0 s/p 4 units
   FFP.
   - Ordered for 2 more units FFP (for total of 6 by [**5-16**] by 7am)
   - Hold coumadin/lovenox in setting of bleed
   - Cardiology recommended initially holding vitamin K but given
   continued bleeding, gave 5 mg [**5-16**] AM
   - Monitor coags q4 hours
   - Check fibrinogen [**Hospital1 **] (wnl thus far)
   - Will restart heparin with goal PTT 60-80 without bolus when INR < 2.0
   and Hct stable X 24 hours without transfusions
   - Continue home dicloxacillin for endocarditis prophylaxis
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. Creatinine 1.7 on admission. Received contrast
   for CT torso with prophylactic bicarb prior to procedure. Contrast
   again for angio, got NAC/bicarb.  Likely prerenal etiology in setting
   of hypovolemia/bleed despite large volume resuscitation; bladder scan
   on admission to MICU with only 50 cc urine. FeNa 0.3% (on diuretics),
   Na 45. Foley in place by urology. Urinalysis benign (neg nitrite,
   leuks; though occ bact on sediment). Low urine output overnight despite
   fluids/blood products.
   - Hold home lisinopril
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Monitor UOP, I/O. IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr.
   - Monitor bladder pressures to rule out abdominal compartment syndrome
   - Follow urine culture (pending)
   .
   # TACHYARRHYTHMIA/HISTORY OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. s/p PMP in [**2139**] in
   setting of CHB.  Pt initially in sinus rhythm, not paced, with RBBB in

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve, who was admitted with a subtherapeutic INR and presents with retroperitoneal bleeding, spontaneous in nature. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions and has a significant drop in hemoglobin levels.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.3°C
* Heart rate: 77 bpm
* Blood pressure: 92/49 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%

The patient's physical examination is significant for:

* Abdomen: Firm, tender to palpation in the left flank, distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, multiple ecchymoses present at sites of lovenox injections; firm mass in the left flank at the site of increased tenderness.
* GU: Foley draining amber urine.

The patient's laboratory results are significant for:

* Hemoglobin: 26.6 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 24.6%
* Platelet count: 193 K/uL
* INR: 2.0
* Creatinine: 1.7 mg/dL
* Lactate: 3.6 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 203 ng/mL

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and the EKG shows a paced rhythm with a heart rate of 108 beats per minute.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for continued bleeding due to the spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma and the supratherapeutic INR.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and the urine output is low, which may indicate acute renal failure.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is slightly supratherapeutic, and the patient is receiving multiple blood transfusions, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently in a paced rhythm, which may increase the risk of tachyarrhythmia.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is not mentioned, but the patient is receiving multiple blood transfusions, which may increase the risk of hyperkalemia.
6. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's blood pressure is low, and the patient is receiving multiple blood transfusions, which may indicate hypovolemic shock.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Maintaining active type and screen, 2 large bore PIV, 2 units crossed in blood bank
* Holding home ASA/coumadin/lovenox, holding antihypertensives
* Monitoring UOP and I/Os and pressures; IVF or blood products for MAP < 65 or UOP < 30 cc/hr
* Monitoring bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome in setting of distention
* Trend lactate
* General surgery following for increased abdominal pressure
* IR following; will not intervene without INR < 2.0
* Morphine for abdominal pain but watch blood pressures
* Guaiac stools

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his bleeding, coagulopathy, and other medical complications to prevent further deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
 RETROPERITONEAL BLEED (RP BLEED), SPONTANEOUS
   67M w/St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] mechanical aortic valve admitted [**Date range (3) 12204**] for
   subtherapeutic INR now on lovenox bridge and coumadin who presents with
   2 days of low back pain and found to have retroperitoneal hematoma in
   setting of 8 point hct drop.
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL BLEED. Retroperitoneal bleed found on CT torso
   w/contrast; 8 point Hct drop; systolics in 70s; on [**5-15**] received 2
   units FFP and 2 units pRBCs, 3.2L IVF in ED, more IVF on floor. On
   floor systolics in 100s (baseline 140s even on antihypertensives); HR
   in 80s. Hct 39.2 on [**5-9**] -> 31.4 at 12pm -> 25.5 at 3pm -> 26.6 at 6pm
   (during second unit pRBC). Etiology for bleed unclear; appears
   spontaneous in setting of supratherapeutic INR and lovenox bridge. CT
   negative for dissection; no history of trauma or recent intravascular
   manipulation/procedures.  Interventional radiology attempted to
   intervene last night but could not find a source for bleed, suggesting
   venous source.
   - Maintain active type and screen, 2 large bore PIV, 2 units crossed in
   blood bank
   - Hct q6h, transfuse for Hct > 25; platelets < 50 in setting of active
   bleeding
   - Hold home ASA/coumadin/lovenox, hold antihypertensives
   - Monitor UOP and I/Os and pressures; IVF or blood products for MAP <
   65 or UOP < 30 cc/hr
   - Monitor bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome in
   setting of distention (initially 21), elevated lactate, decreased UOP.
   - Trend lactate
   - General surgery following for increased abdominal pressure:
   appreciate recs
   - Vascular surgery following: appreciate recs - for now will defer to
   IR
   - IR following
   - Morphine for abdominal pain but watch blood pressures
   - Guaiac stools
   -fentanyl patch for pain control
   .
   # COAGULOPATHY/MECHANICAL VALVE. St. Jude's valve in aortic position,
   pt on coumadin with lovenox bridge. INR slightly supratherapeutic at
   4.2 on admission (goal 2.5-3.5). [**5-16**] INR decreased to 2.0 s/p 4 units
   FFP.  Patient received oral vitamin K overnight.
   - Ordered for 2 more units FFP (for total of 6 by [**5-16**] by 7am)
   - Will give vitamin K 5mg IV x 1 now
   - Hold coumadin/lovenox in setting of bleed
   - Cardiology recommended initially holding vitamin K but given
   continued bleeding, gave 5 mg [**5-16**] AM
   - Monitor coags q4 hours
   - Check fibrinogen [**Hospital1 **] (wnl thus far)
   - Will restart heparin with goal PTT 60-80 without bolus when INR < 2.0
   and Hct stable X 24 hours without transfusions
   - Continue home dicloxacillin for endocarditis prophylaxis
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. Creatinine 1.7 on admission. Received contrast
   for CT torso with prophylactic bicarb prior to procedure. Contrast
   again for angio, got NAC/bicarb.  Likely prerenal etiology in setting
   of hypovolemia/bleed despite large volume resuscitation; bladder scan
   on admission to MICU with only 50 cc urine. FeNa 0.3% (on diuretics),
   Na 45. Foley in place by urology. Urinalysis benign (neg nitrite,
   leuks; though occ bact on sediment). Low urine output overnight despite
   fluids/blood products.
   - Hold home lisinopril
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Monitor UOP, I/O. IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr.
   - Monitor bladder pressures to rule out abdominal compartment syndrome
   - Follow urine culture (pending)
   - bolus 1 liter of fluid now and monitor UOP
   .
   # TACHYARRHYTHMIA/HISTORY OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. s/p PMP in [**2139**] in
   setting of CHB.  Pt initially in sinus rhythm, not paced, with RBBB in
   70s-90s. Later pt developed WCT, a-sensed v-paced, to 100s-120s, may
   have p waves present indicating this is a sinus tachycardia. In and out
   of sinus rhythm.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Hold home metoprolol in setting of active bleeding/hypovolemia
   - consider EP consult if other arrhythmias or if PM interrogation
   required.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS. Possibly related to bleeding, multiple transfusions.
   - Trend WBC, monitor temperature, CIS.
   - Follow urine culture (pending)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve who was admitted for subtherapeutic INR and presented with 2 days of low back pain. He was found to have a retroperitoneal hematoma with an 8-point Hct drop. The etiology of the bleed is unclear, but it appears spontaneous in setting of supratherapeutic INR and lovenox bridge.

The patient has received multiple blood products, including 5 units of packed red blood cells and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma, and has received IV fluids and vasopressors to maintain blood pressure.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Retroperitoneal bleed: The patient's bleed is ongoing, and further intervention may be needed to identify and treat the source of the bleeding.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is slightly supratherapeutic, and he is at risk for further bleeding complications.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine is elevated, and he has received contrast agents for imaging studies. He is at risk for further kidney damage.
4. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and has developed a paced WCT, which may indicate a sinus tachycardia.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be related to bleeding or multiple transfusions.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and he is at risk for further hypertensive episodes.
7. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient has a Foley catheter in place and is at risk for developing compartment syndrome due to distention and elevated lactate levels.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Maintaining active type and screen, 2 large bore PIV, and 2 units crossed in blood bank.
2. Monitoring UOP and I/Os and pressures, and IVF or blood products for MAP < 65 or UOP < 30 cc/hr.
3. Monitoring bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of aortic valve replacement (AVR) on coumadin, admitted to the ICU with spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed) in the setting of an international normalized ratio (INR) of 4.2. The patient underwent an unsuccessful interventional radiology (IR) procedure to locate the source of the bleeding. He received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), but his hemoglobin (Hct) continued to drop. The patient is currently hypovolemic with low urine output and is being treated with aggressive intravenous fluid (IVF) and vitamin K to correct the coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's INR is still elevated, and he is at risk for further bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ dysfunction.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to hypovolemia and dye load, and continued IVF and monitoring of urine output are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is currently limited to nasal cannula oxygen, but he may require more aggressive respiratory support if his condition deteriorates.
4. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of underlying infection, and close monitoring for signs of sepsis is necessary.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently well-controlled, but he may be at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's distended and tender abdomen, particularly in the left lower quadrant (LLQ), may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, which could worsen his condition.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to his immobility and may require prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and/or anticoagulation therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 FEVER - 101.2
F - [**2142-5-16**] 09:00 PM
   - PM Hct 23 (from 25) after 1 unit of pRBCs in AM; ordered for 1
   additional unit of pRBCs
   - Pt subjectively SOB at ~3:30 PM, though O2 sats 100%; ordered for
   albuterol/ipratropium nebs with no relief of symptoms. O2 sats dropped
   transiently to 92-93% in setting of hyperventillation and patient
   appeared uncomfortable, so BiPAP initiated. Got IV Lasix 40, then 80 mg
   but no increased UOP.
   - CXR showed increased opacity over LLL (some effusion there)
   - EKG showed T-wave inversions in anterior leads more pronounced than
   on prior (although quality of EKG was low given patient's movement).
   - Cardiac enzymes showed elevated CK but only proportionally elevated
   CK-MB and flat troponins, raising concern for ? intra-abdominal process
   contributing to muscle necrosis
   - At 6:00 PM, patient still appearing in distress (anxious,
   diaphoretic) despite O2 sats in upper 90s. Lactate trending up, UOP
   trailing off, bladder pressure up to 29. Patient intubated.
   - Patient became hypotensive, so CVL placed in LIJ, but only extended
   to brachiocephalic. [**Month (only) 60**] need to be exchanged over wire for 20-cm line
   (current line is 16-cm).
   - Started on pressors with neo; converted to levophed for goal MAP > 65
   - A-line not placed
   - Spiked fever in PM to > 101, so started on vanco/zosyn, cultured. Of
   note, pus was leaking from around Foley at this time.
   - Bladder pressures trending up (25-29), Hct not yet stable, patient
   clinically worsening so contact[**Name (NI) **] surgery to update/re-evaluate as
   needed; they will add patient back onto list in AM if still unstable
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2759**] (PCP) came to evaluate patient. He would like to
   communicate to team that he feels it is better to give MORE blood to
   keep up with losses and avoid hypoperfusion to organs. Also, was
   interested in giving protamine (limited data; see email) as the patient
   had recently been on Lovenox in addition to warfarin, and may need

   Assessment and Plan
   67M w/St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] mechanical aortic valve admitted [**Date range (3) 12204**] for
   subtherapeutic INR now on lovenox bridge and coumadin who presents with
   2 days of low back pain and found to have retroperitoneal hematoma in
   setting of 8 point hct drop.
   .
   # Respiratory distress. Patient intubated [**5-16**] after ~90 minutes of
   uncomfortable breathing, patient in distress despite O2 sats in upper
   90s, no response to Lasix or IVF. Concern that origin of SOB may be
   increased abdominal pressure/work of breathing. Unable to tolerate
   BiPAP so intubated.
   - Currently on trial of pressure support
   - Monitor for PIP > 30 as could indicate compartment syndrome
   - Consider mental status, patient
s ability to tolerate BIPAP prior to
   extubation
   .
   # Hypotension. Patient dropped pressures to SBPs in 80s MAPs in 50s
   shortly after intubation and was unable to tolerate even low dose
   sedation. Therefore, CVL placed and started on pressors (initially neo,
   then converted to levophed).
   - Wean as tolerated
   - Goal MAP > 65
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL BLEED. Retroperitoneal bleed found on CT torso
   w/contrast; 8 point Hct drop; systolics in 70s; on [**5-15**] received 2
   units FFP and 2 units pRBCs, 3.2L IVF in ED, more IVF on floor. On
   floor systolics in 100s (baseline 140s even on antihypertensives); HR
   in 80s. Hct 39.2 on [**5-9**] -> 31.4 at 12pm -> 25.5 at 3pm -> 26.6 at 6pm
   (during second unit pRBC). Etiology for bleed unclear; appears
   spontaneous in setting of supratherapeutic INR and lovenox bridge. CT
   negative for dissection; no history of trauma or recent intravascular
   manipulation/procedures.  Interventional radiology attempted to
   intervene last night but could not find a source for bleed, suggesting
   venous source.  To date, patient has received 9 units of pRBCs with no
   bump in Hct.  Discoloration of skin apparent.
   - Maintain active type and screen, 2 large bore PIV, 2 units crossed in
   blood bank
   - Hct q6h, transfuse for Hct > 25; platelets < 50 in setting of active
   bleeding
   - Hold home ASA/coumadin/lovenox, hold antihypertensives
   - Monitor UOP and I/Os and pressures
   - Monitor bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome in
   setting of distention (initially 21), elevated lactate, decreased UOP.
   - Trend lactate (increasing)
   - General surgery following for increased abdominal pressure:
   appreciate recs
   - Vascular surgery following: appreciate recs - for now will defer to
   IR
   - IR following
 discuss value of tagged RBC scan to identify ? site of
   bleeding
   - Morphine for abdominal pain but watch blood pressures
   - Guaiac stools
   - fentanyl patch for pain control
   .
   # COAGULOPATHY/MECHANICAL VALVE. St. Jude's valve in aortic position,
   pt on coumadin with lovenox bridge. INR slightly supratherapeutic at
   4.2 on admission (goal 2.5-3.5). [**5-16**] INR decreased to 2.0 s/p 4 units
   FFP.  Patient received oral vitamin K overnight. Total of 6 units FFP.
   INR now ~ normalized at 1.2.
   - Hold coumadin/lovenox in setting of bleed
   - Cardiology recommended initially holding vitamin K but given
   continued bleeding, gave 5 mg [**5-16**] AM
   - Monitor coags daily
   - Check fibrinogen [**Hospital1 **] (wnl thus far)
   - Continue home dicloxacillin for endocarditis prophylaxis
   - Discuss reversal with protamine
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. Creatinine 1.7 on admission. Received contrast
   for CT torso with prophylactic bicarb prior to procedure. Contrast
   again for angio, got NAC/bicarb.  Likely prerenal etiology in setting
   of hypovolemia/bleed despite large volume resuscitation; bladder scan
   on admission to MICU with only 50 cc urine. FeNa 0.3% (on diuretics),
   Na 45. Foley in place by urology. Urinalysis benign (neg nitrite,
   leuks; though occ bact on sediment). Low urine output overnight despite
   fluids/blood products. UOP currently down to 15 cc/hr. Renal failure
   likely secondary to increased abdominal pressure and poor perfusion to
   kidneys.
   - Hold home lisinopril
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Monitor UOP, I/O. IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr.
   - Monitor bladder pressures to rule out abdominal compartment syndrome
   - Follow urine culture (pending)
   - Maintain Hct > 25
   .
   # Rising CKs. Do not seem cardiac in nature as CK-MB are only
   proportionally elevated and troponins < 0.1. Concerned that this may
   relate to muscle breakdown secondary to compartment syndrome.
   - Trend CKs
   - Monitor for compartment syndrome as below
   - Held statin (recently changed type/dose to 80 simvastatin) in acute
   setting
   .
   # Concern for compartment syndrome. Surgical team continues to feel no
   role for surgery at this time as patient not meeting surgical criteria
   for compartment syndrome. The criteria would be:
   1)       Anuria or very low UOP
   2)       Bladder pressures > 25-30 (may be unreliable in setting of
   retroperitoneal bleed)
   3)       PIP > 30
   .
   # TACHYARRHYTHMIA/HISTORY OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. s/p PMP in [**2139**] in
   setting of CHB.  Pt initially in sinus rhythm, not paced, with RBBB in
   70s-90s. Later pt developed WCT, a-sensed v-paced, to 100s-120s, may
   have p waves present indicating this is a sinus tachycardia. In and out
   of sinus rhythm.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Hold home metoprolol in setting of active bleeding/hypovolemia
   - consider EP consult if other arrhythmias or if PM interrogation
   required.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS. Possibly related to bleeding, multiple transfusions.
   Still rising to 18 K today. Had episode of fever overnight so
   pan-cultured; sputum with multiple species of organisms. Pus at Foley
   site suggests one source of infection
   - Trend WBC, monitor temperature, CIS.
   - Follow urine, blood, sputum cultures (pending)
   - Tylenol for fever PRN
   - Leaving Foley in place for now as difficult to place (required
   urology)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG. EKG showed more pronounced T-wave inversions after
   episode of SOB on [**5-16**].
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes in setting of bleed; first two sets negative
   - Hold ASA in setting of active bleeding
   - Re-check EKG
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - Simvastatin held as above
   .
   # HYPERTENSION
   - Hold home lisinopril, metoprolol, HCTZ in setting of active bleeding.
   .
   # COPD
   - Continue home atrovent prn
   .
   # HISTORY OF GIB
   - Continue home omeprazole
   - Hold home iron until taking POs
   .
   # FEN: pRBCs/IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO except meds in setting of
   active bleeding; senna prn when taking POs
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (hold anticoagulation in setting of bleed)
   # Access: 2 PIV, CVL (may need to be replaced with 20-cm line), A-line
   is needed given pressors
   # Communication: Patient; sister [**Name (NI) 12205**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12206**] is HCP

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - Pt subjectively SOB at ~3:30 PM, though O2 sats 100%; ordered for
   albuterol/ipratropium nebs with no relief of symptoms. O2 sats dropped
   transiently to 92-93% in setting of hyperventillation and patient
   appeared uncomfortable, so BiPAP initiated. Got IV Lasix 40, then 80 mg
   but no increased UOP.
   - CXR showed increased opacity over LLL (some effusion there)
   - EKG showed T-wave inversions in anterior leads more pronounced than
   on prior (although quality of EKG was low given patient's movement).
   - Cardiac enzymes showed elevated CK but only proportionally elevated
   CK-MB and flat troponins, raising concern for ? intra-abdominal process
   contributing to muscle necrosis
   - At 6:00 PM, patient still appearing in distress (anxious,
   diaphoretic) despite O2 sats in upper 90s. Lactate trending up, UOP
   trailing off, bladder pressure up to 29. Patient intubated.
   - Patient became hypotensive, so CVL placed in LIJ, but only extended
   to brachiocephalic. [**Month (only) 60**] need to be exchanged over wire for 20-cm line
   (current line is 16-cm).
   - Started on pressors with neo; converted to levophed for goal MAP > 65
   - A-line not placed
   - Spiked fever in PM to > 101, so started on vanco/zosyn, cultured. Of
   note, pus was leaking from around Foley at this time.
   - Bladder pressures trending up (25-29), Hct not yet stable, patient

   Assessment and Plan
   67M w/St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] mechanical aortic valve admitted [**Date range (3) 12204**] for
   subtherapeutic INR now on lovenox bridge and coumadin who presents with
   2 days of low back pain and found to have retroperitoneal hematoma in
   setting of 8 point hct drop.
   .
   # Respiratory distress. Patient intubated [**5-16**] after ~90 minutes of
   uncomfortable breathing, patient in distress despite O2 sats in upper
   90s, no response to Lasix or IVF. Concern that origin of SOB may be
   increased abdominal pressure/work of breathing. Unable to tolerate
   BiPAP so intubated.
   - Currently on trial of pressure support
   - Monitor for PIP > 30 as could indicate compartment syndrome
   - Consider mental status, patient
s ability to tolerate BIPAP prior to
   extubation
   .
   # Hypotension. Patient dropped pressures to SBPs in 80s MAPs in 50s
   shortly after intubation and was unable to tolerate even low dose
   sedation. Therefore, CVL placed and started on pressors (initially neo,
   then converted to levophed).
   - Wean as tolerated
   - Goal MAP > 65
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL BLEED. Retroperitoneal bleed found on CT torso
   w/contrast; 8 point Hct drop; systolics in 70s; on [**5-15**] received 2
   units FFP and 2 units pRBCs, 3.2L IVF in ED, more IVF on floor. On
   floor systolics in 100s (baseline 140s even on antihypertensives); HR
   in 80s. Hct 39.2 on [**5-9**] -> 31.4 at 12pm -> 25.5 at 3pm -> 26.6 at 6pm
   (during second unit pRBC). Etiology for bleed unclear; appears
   spontaneous in setting of supratherapeutic INR and lovenox bridge. CT
   negative for dissection; no history of trauma or recent intravascular
   manipulation/procedures.  Interventional radiology attempted to
   intervene last night but could not find a source for bleed, suggesting
   venous source.  To date, patient has received 9 units of pRBCs with no
   bump in Hct.  Discoloration of skin apparent.
   - Maintain active type and screen, 2 large bore PIV, 2 units crossed in
   blood bank
   - Hct q6h, transfuse for Hct > 25; platelets < 50 in setting of active
   bleeding
   - Hold home ASA/coumadin/lovenox, hold antihypertensives
   - Monitor UOP and I/Os and pressures
   - Monitor bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome in
   setting of distention (initially 21), elevated lactate, decreased UOP.
   - Trend lactate (increasing)
   - General surgery following for increased abdominal pressure:
   appreciate recs
   - Vascular surgery following: appreciate recs - for now will defer to
   IR
   - IR following
 discuss value of tagged RBC scan to identify ? site of
   bleeding
   - Morphine for abdominal pain but watch blood pressures
   - Guaiac stools
   - fentanyl patch for pain control
   .
   # COAGULOPATHY/MECHANICAL VALVE. St. Jude's valve in aortic position,
   pt on coumadin with lovenox bridge. INR slightly supratherapeutic at
   4.2 on admission (goal 2.5-3.5). [**5-16**] INR decreased to 2.0 s/p 4 units
   FFP.  Patient received oral vitamin K overnight. Total of 6 units FFP.
   INR now ~ normalized at 1.2.
   - Hold coumadin/lovenox in setting of bleed
   - Cardiology recommended initially holding vitamin K but given
   continued bleeding, gave 5 mg [**5-16**] AM
   - Monitor coags daily
   - Check fibrinogen [**Hospital1 **] (wnl thus far)
   - Continue home dicloxacillin for endocarditis prophylaxis
   - Discuss reversal with protamine
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. Creatinine 1.7 on admission. Received contrast
   for CT torso with prophylactic bicarb prior to procedure. Contrast
   again for angio, got NAC/bicarb.  Likely prerenal etiology in setting
   of hypovolemia/bleed despite large volume resuscitation; bladder scan
   on admission to MICU with only 50 cc urine. FeNa 0.3% (on diuretics),
   Na 45. Foley in place by urology. Urinalysis benign (neg nitrite,
   leuks; though occ bact on sediment). Low urine output overnight despite
   fluids/blood products. UOP currently down to 15 cc/hr. Renal failure
   likely secondary to increased abdominal pressure and poor perfusion to
   kidneys.
   - Hold home lisinopril
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Monitor UOP, I/O. IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr.
   - Monitor bladder pressures to rule out abdominal compartment syndrome
   - Follow urine culture (pending)
   - Maintain Hct > 25
   .
   # Rising CKs. Do not seem cardiac in nature as CK-MB are only
   proportionally elevated and troponins < 0.1. Concerned that this may
   relate to muscle breakdown secondary to compartment syndrome.
   - Trend CKs
   - Monitor for compartment syndrome as below
   - Held statin (recently changed type/dose to 80 simvastatin) in acute
   setting
   .
   # Concern for compartment syndrome. Surgical team continues to feel no
   role for surgery at this time as patient not meeting surgical criteria
   for compartment syndrome. The criteria would be:
   1)       Anuria or very low UOP
   2)       Bladder pressures > 25-30 (may be unreliable in setting of
   retroperitoneal bleed)
   3)       PIP > 30
   .
   # TACHYARRHYTHMIA/HISTORY OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. s/p PMP in [**2139**] in
   setting of CHB.  Pt initially in sinus rhythm, not paced, with RBBB in
   70s-90s. Later pt developed WCT, a-sensed v-paced, to 100s-120s, may
   have p waves present indicating this is a sinus tachycardia. In and out
   of sinus rhythm.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Hold home metoprolol in setting of active bleeding/hypovolemia
   - consider EP consult if other arrhythmias or if PM interrogation
   required.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS. Possibly related to bleeding, multiple transfusions.
   Still rising to 18 K today. Had episode of fever overnight so
   pan-cultured; sputum with multiple species of organisms. Pus at Foley
   site suggests one source of infection
   - Trend WBC, monitor temperature, CIS.
   - Follow urine, blood, sputum cultures (pending)
   - Tylenol for fever PRN
   - Leaving Foley in place for now as difficult to place (required
   urology)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG. EKG showed more pronounced T-wave inversions after
   episode of SOB on [**5-16**].
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes in setting of bleed; first two sets negative
   - Hold ASA in setting of active bleeding
   - Re-check EKG
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - Simvastatin held as above
   .
   # HYPERTENSION
   - Hold home lisinopril, metoprolol, HCTZ in setting of active bleeding.
   .
   # COPD
   - Continue home atrovent prn
   .
   # HISTORY OF GIB
   - Continue home omeprazole
   - Hold home iron until taking POs
   .
   # FEN: pRBCs/IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO except meds in setting of
   active bleeding; senna prn when taking POs
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (hold anticoagulation in setting of bleed)
   # Access: 2 PIV, CVL (may need to be replaced with 20-cm line), A-line
   is needed given pressors

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve who presented with subtherapeutic INR and retroperitoneal hematoma. He has undergone multiple blood transfusions and has a complex medical condition with multiple comorbidities.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory distress: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to increased abdominal pressure and work of breathing.
* Hypotension: The patient has had multiple episodes of hypotension, which have been treated with vasopressors.
* Retroperitoneal bleed: The patient has a retroperitoneal bleed with an unclear etiology, which has been treated with multiple blood transfusions and has resulted in a significant drop in hematocrit.
* Coagulopathy/mechanical valve: The patient is on warfarin with a lovenox bridge, and his INR is slightly supratherapeutic. He has received multiple units of fresh frozen plasma and has been treated with protamine.
* Acute renal failure: The patient has a creatinine of 1.7 and has been treated with diuretics. His urine output is low, and he has been placed on a fluid restriction.
* Rising CKs: The patient's creatine kinase levels are rising, and his CK-MB levels are proportionally elevated. This may be related to muscle breakdown secondary to compartment syndrome.
* Concern for compartment syndrome: The patient's bladder pressures are elevated, and he has a risk of developing compartment syndrome.
* Tachyarrhythmia/history of atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and has been treated with amiodarone.
* Leukocytosis: The patient has a rising white blood cell count, which may be related to bleeding and multiple transfusions.
* CAD s/p CABG: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing mechanical ventilation and vasopressors as needed
* Monitoring of blood pressure, hematocrit, and urine output
* Continuation of diuretics and fluid restriction
* Monitoring of creatine kinase levels and trend
* Consideration of a tagged RBC scan to identify the site of bleeding
* Monitoring of abdominal pressure and bladder pressures to rule out compartment syndrome
* Follow-up of urine, blood, and sputum cultures
* Treatment of hyperkalemia with potassium supplements
* Monitoring of electrolyte levels and trend
* Continuation of cardiac enzymes and trend
* Consideration of a consult with interventional radiology to evaluate the retroperitoneal bleed
* Consideration of a consult with cardiology to evaluate the patient's cardiac status.

The patient's family has been informed of his condition, and code status has been discussed. The patient is currently in the ICU and will be monitored closely for any changes in his condition."

   - PM Hct 23 (from 25) after 1 unit of pRBCs in AM; ordered for 1
   additional unit of pRBCs
   - Pt subjectively SOB at ~3:30 PM, though O2 sats 100%; ordered for
   albuterol/ipratropium nebs with no relief of symptoms. O2 sats dropped
   transiently to 92-93% in setting of hyperventillation and patient
   appeared uncomfortable, so BiPAP initiated. Got IV Lasix 40, then 80 mg
   but no increased UOP.
   - CXR showed increased opacity over LLL (some effusion there)
   - EKG showed T-wave inversions in anterior leads more pronounced than
   on prior (although quality of EKG was low given patient's movement).
   - Cardiac enzymes showed elevated CK but only proportionally elevated
   CK-MB and flat troponins, raising concern for ? intra-abdominal process
   contributing to muscle necrosis
   - At 6:00 PM, patient still appearing in distress (anxious,
   diaphoretic) despite O2 sats in upper 90s. Lactate trending up, UOP
   trailing off, bladder pressure up to 29. Patient intubated.
   - Patient became hypotensive, so CVL placed in LIJ, but only extended
   to brachiocephalic. [**Month (only) 60**] need to be exchanged over wire for 20-cm line
   (current line is 16-cm).
   - Started on pressors with neo; converted to levophed for goal MAP > 65
   - A-line not placed
   - Spiked fever in PM to > 101, so started on vanco/zosyn, cultured. Of
   note, pus was leaking from around Foley at this time.
   - Bladder pressures trending up (25-29), Hct not yet stable, patient
   clinically worsening so contact[**Name (NI) **] surgery to update/re-evaluate as

   Assessment and Plan
   67M w/St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] mechanical aortic valve admitted [**Date range (3) 12204**] for
   subtherapeutic INR now on lovenox bridge and coumadin who presents with
   2 days of low back pain and found to have retroperitoneal hematoma in
   setting of 8 point hct drop.
   .
   # Respiratory distress. Patient intubated [**5-16**] after ~90 minutes of
   uncomfortable breathing, patient in distress despite O2 sats in upper
   90s, no response to Lasix or IVF. Concern that origin of SOB may be
   increased abdominal pressure/work of breathing. Unable to tolerate
   BiPAP so intubated.
   - Currently on trial of pressure support
   - Monitor for PIP > 30 as could indicate compartment syndrome
   - Consider mental status, patient
s ability to tolerate BIPAP prior to
   extubation
   .
   # Hypotension. Patient dropped pressures to SBPs in 80s MAPs in 50s
   shortly after intubation and was unable to tolerate even low dose
   sedation. Therefore, CVL placed and started on pressors (initially neo,
   then converted to levophed).
   - Wean as tolerated
   - Goal MAP > 65
   .
   # Retroperitoneal bleed. Retroperitoneal bleed found on CT torso
   w/contrast; 8 point Hct drop; systolics in 70s; on [**5-15**] received 2
   units FFP and 2 units pRBCs, 3.2L IVF in ED, more IVF on floor. On
   floor systolics in 100s (baseline 140s even on antihypertensives); HR
   in 80s. Hct 39.2 on [**5-9**] -> 31.4 at 12pm -> 25.5 at 3pm -> 26.6 at 6pm
   (during second unit pRBC). Etiology for bleed unclear; appears
   spontaneous in setting of supratherapeutic INR and lovenox bridge. CT
   negative for dissection; no history of trauma or recent intravascular
   manipulation/procedures.  Interventional radiology attempted to
   intervene last night but could not find a source for bleed, suggesting
   venous source.  To date, patient has received 9 units of pRBCs with no
   bump in Hct.  Patient with elevated PIP, worsening creatinine, CKs, and
   bladder pressure concerning for abdominal compartment syndrome. General
   Surgery and Vascular surgery and IR are evaluating to determine optimal
   mngt at this time.
   - Maintain active type and screen, 2 large bore PIV, 2 units crossed in
   blood bank
   - Hct q6h, transfuse for Hct > 27; platelets < 50 in setting of active
   bleeding
   - Hold home ASA/coumadin/lovenox and send factor XA level
   - Hold antihypertensives
   - Monitor UOP and I/Os and pressures
   - Coordinate w/ IR whether tagged RBC scan or CT abdomen (non-con)
   would be more helpful to eval for bleeding
   - Coordinate with gen surgery, vascular [**Doctor First Name 458**] possible operative
   management in setting of concern for compartment syndrome
   - Monitor bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome in
   setting of elevated lactate, decreased UOP.
   - Trend lactate (increasing)
   - General surgery following for increased abdominal pressure:
   appreciate recs
   - Morphine for abdominal pain but watch blood pressures
   - Guaiac stools
   - fentanyl patch for pain control
   .
   # Concern for compartment syndrome.   Patient with elevated PIP,
   worsening creatinine, oliguria, elevated CKs, and bladder pressure
   concerning for abdominal compartment syndrome. General Surgery and
   Vascular surgery and IR are evaluating to determine optimal mngt.  We
   are coordinating with these teams at this time.
   .
   # COAGULOPATHY/MECHANICAL VALVE. St. Jude's valve in aortic position,
   pt on coumadin with lovenox bridge. INR slightly supratherapeutic at
   4.2 on admission (goal 2.5-3.5). [**5-16**] INR decreased to 2.0 s/p 4 units
   FFP.  Patient received oral vitamin K overnight. Total of 6 units FFP.
   INR now ~ normalized at 1.2.
   - Hold coumadin/lovenox in setting of bleed
   - Cardiology recommended initially holding vitamin K but given
   continued bleeding, gave 5 mg [**5-16**] AM
   - Monitor coags daily
   - Check fibrinogen [**Hospital1 **] (wnl thus far)
   - Continue home dicloxacillin for endocarditis prophylaxis
   - Discuss reversal with protamine
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. Creatinine 1.7 on admission. Received contrast
   for CT torso with prophylactic bicarb prior to procedure. Contrast
   again for angio, got NAC/bicarb.  Likely prerenal etiology in setting
   of hypovolemia/bleed despite large volume resuscitation; bladder scan
   on admission to MICU with only 50 cc urine. FeNa 0.3% (on diuretics),
   Na 45. Foley in place by urology. Urinalysis benign (neg nitrite,
   leuks; though occ bact on sediment). Low urine output overnight despite
   fluids/blood products. UOP currently down to 15 cc/hr. Renal failure
   likely secondary to increased abdominal pressure and poor perfusion to
   kidneys rather than hypovolemia.
   - Hold home lisinopril
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Monitor UOP, I/O. IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr.
   - Trend bladder pressures, CK, lactate
   - Follow urine culture (pending)
   - Maintain Hct > 25
   .
   # Rising CKs. Do not seem cardiac in nature as CK-MB are only
   proportionally elevated and troponins < 0.1. Concerned that this may
   relate to muscle breakdown secondary to compartment syndrome.
   - Trend CKs
   - Monitor for compartment syndrome as below
   - D/C statin (recently changed type/dose to 80 simvastatin) in acute
   setting
   ..
   # TACHYARRHYTHMIA/HISTORY OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. s/p PMP in [**2139**] in
   setting of CHB.  Pt initially in sinus rhythm, not paced, with RBBB in
   70s-90s. Later pt developed WCT, a-sensed v-paced, to 100s-120s, may
   have p waves present indicating this is a sinus tachycardia. In and out
   of sinus rhythm.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Hold home metoprolol in setting of active bleeding/hypovolemia
   - consider EP consult if other arrhythmias or if PM interrogation
   required.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS. Possibly related to bleeding, multiple transfusions.
   Still rising to 18 K today. Had episode of fever overnight so
   pan-cultured; sputum with multiple species of organisms. Pus at Foley
   site suggests one source of infection
   - Trend WBC, monitor temperature, CIS.
   - Follow urine, blood, sputum cultures (pending)
   - Tylenol for fever PRN
   - Leaving Foley in place for now as difficult to place (required
   urology)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG. EKG showed more pronounced T-wave inversions after
   episode of SOB on [**5-16**].
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes in setting of bleed; first two sets negative
   - Hold ASA in setting of active bleeding
   - Re-check EKG
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - Simvastatin held as above
   .
   # HYPERTENSION
   - Hold home lisinopril, metoprolol, HCTZ in setting of active bleeding.
   .
   # COPD
   - Continue home atrovent prn
   .
   # HISTORY OF GIB
   - Continue home omeprazole
   - Hold home iron until taking POs
   .
   # FEN: pRBCs/IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO except meds in setting of
   active bleeding; senna prn when taking POs
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (hold anticoagulation in setting of bleed)
   # Access: 2 PIV, CVL (may need to be replaced with 20-cm line), A-line
   is needed given pressors
   # Communication: Patient; sister [**Name (NI) 12205**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12206**] is HCP

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - PM Hct 23 (from 25) after 1 unit of pRBCs in AM; ordered for 1
   additional unit of pRBCs
   - Pt subjectively SOB at ~3:30 PM, though O2 sats 100%; ordered for
   albuterol/ipratropium nebs with no relief of symptoms. O2 sats dropped
   transiently to 92-93% in setting of hyperventillation and patient
   appeared uncomfortable, so BiPAP initiated. Got IV Lasix 40, then 80 mg
   but no increased UOP.
   - CXR showed increased opacity over LLL (some effusion there)
   - EKG showed T-wave inversions in anterior leads more pronounced than
   on prior (although quality of EKG was low given patient's movement).
   - Cardiac enzymes showed elevated CK but only proportionally elevated
   CK-MB and flat troponins, raising concern for ? intra-abdominal process
   contributing to muscle necrosis
   - At 6:00 PM, patient still appearing in distress (anxious,
   diaphoretic) despite O2 sats in upper 90s. Lactate trending up, UOP
   trailing off, bladder pressure up to 29. Patient intubated.
   - Patient became hypotensive, so CVL placed in LIJ, but only extended
   to brachiocephalic. [**Month (only) 60**] need to be exchanged over wire for 20-cm line
   (current line is 16-cm).
   - Started on pressors with neo; converted to levophed for goal MAP > 65
   - A-line not placed
   - Spiked fever in PM to > 101, so started on vanco/zosyn, cultured. Of
   note, pus was leaking from around Foley at this time.
   - Bladder pressures trending up (25-29), Hct not yet stable, patient
   clinically worsening so contact[**Name (NI) **] surgery to update/re-evaluate as
   needed; they will add patient back onto list in AM if still unstable
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2759**] (PCP) came to evaluate patient. He would like to
   communicate to team that he feels it is better to give MORE blood to
   keep up with losses and avoid hypoperfusion to organs. Also, was
   interested in giving protamine (limited data; see email) as the patient
   had recently been on Lovenox in addition to warfarin, and may need
   additional reversal.

   Assessment and Plan
   67M w/St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] mechanical aortic valve admitted [**Date range (3) 12204**] for
   subtherapeutic INR now on lovenox bridge and coumadin who presents with
   2 days of low back pain and found to have retroperitoneal hematoma in
   setting of 8 point hct drop.
   .
   # Respiratory distress. Patient intubated [**5-16**] after ~90 minutes of
   uncomfortable breathing, patient in distress despite O2 sats in upper
   90s, no response to Lasix or IVF. Concern that origin of SOB may be
   increased abdominal pressure/work of breathing. Unable to tolerate
   BiPAP so intubated.
   - Currently on trial of pressure support
   - Monitor for PIP > 30 as could indicate compartment syndrome
   - Consider mental status, patient
s ability to tolerate BIPAP prior to
   extubation
   .
   # Hypotension. Patient dropped pressures to SBPs in 80s MAPs in 50s
   shortly after intubation and was unable to tolerate even low dose
   sedation. Therefore, CVL placed and started on pressors (initially neo,
   then converted to levophed).
   - Wean as tolerated
   - Goal MAP > 65
   .
   # Retroperitoneal bleed. Retroperitoneal bleed found on CT torso
   w/contrast; 8 point Hct drop; systolics in 70s; on [**5-15**] received 2
   units FFP and 2 units pRBCs, 3.2L IVF in ED, more IVF on floor. On
   floor systolics in 100s (baseline 140s even on antihypertensives); HR
   in 80s. Hct 39.2 on [**5-9**] -> 31.4 at 12pm -> 25.5 at 3pm -> 26.6 at 6pm
   (during second unit pRBC). Etiology for bleed unclear; appears
   spontaneous in setting of supratherapeutic INR and lovenox bridge. CT
   negative for dissection; no history of trauma or recent intravascular
   manipulation/procedures.  Interventional radiology attempted to
   intervene last night but could not find a source for bleed, suggesting
   venous source.  To date, patient has received 9 units of pRBCs with no
   bump in Hct.  Patient with elevated PIP, worsening creatinine, CKs, and
   bladder pressure concerning for abdominal compartment syndrome. General
   Surgery and Vascular surgery and IR are evaluating to determine optimal
   mngt at this time.
   - Maintain active type and screen, 2 large bore PIV, 2 units crossed in
   blood bank
   - Hct q6h, transfuse for Hct > 27; platelets < 50 in setting of active
   bleeding
   - Hold home ASA/coumadin/lovenox and send factor XA level
   - Hold antihypertensives
   - Monitor UOP and I/Os and pressures
   - Coordinate w/ IR whether tagged RBC scan or CT abdomen (non-con)
   would be more helpful to eval for bleeding
   - Coordinate with gen surgery, vascular [**Doctor First Name 458**] possible operative
   management in setting of concern for compartment syndrome
   - Monitor bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome in
   setting of elevated lactate, decreased UOP.
   - Trend lactate (increasing)
   - General surgery following for increased abdominal pressure:
   appreciate recs
   - Morphine for abdominal pain but watch blood pressures
   - Guaiac stools
   - fentanyl patch for pain control
   .
   # Concern for compartment syndrome.   Patient with elevated PIP,
   worsening creatinine, oliguria, elevated CKs, and bladder pressure
   concerning for abdominal compartment syndrome. General Surgery and
   Vascular surgery and IR are evaluating to determine optimal mngt.  We
   are coordinating with these teams at this time.
   .
   # COAGULOPATHY/MECHANICAL VALVE. St. Jude's valve in aortic position,
   pt on coumadin with lovenox bridge. INR slightly supratherapeutic at
   4.2 on admission (goal 2.5-3.5). [**5-16**] INR decreased to 2.0 s/p 4 units
   FFP.  Patient received oral vitamin K overnight. Total of 6 units FFP.
   INR now ~ normalized at 1.2.
   - Hold coumadin/lovenox in setting of bleed
   - Cardiology recommended initially holding vitamin K but given
   continued bleeding, gave 5 mg [**5-16**] AM
   - Monitor coags daily
   - Check fibrinogen [**Hospital1 **] (wnl thus far)
   - Continue home dicloxacillin for endocarditis prophylaxis
   - Discuss reversal with protamine
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. Creatinine 1.7 on admission. Received contrast
   for CT torso with prophylactic bicarb prior to procedure. Contrast
   again for angio, got NAC/bicarb.  Likely prerenal etiology in setting
   of hypovolemia/bleed despite large volume resuscitation; bladder scan
   on admission to MICU with only 50 cc urine. FeNa 0.3% (on diuretics),
   Na 45. Foley in place by urology. Urinalysis benign (neg nitrite,
   leuks; though occ bact on sediment). Low urine output overnight despite
   fluids/blood products. UOP currently down to 15 cc/hr. Renal failure
   likely secondary to increased abdominal pressure and poor perfusion to
   kidneys rather than hypovolemia.
   - Hold home lisinopril
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Monitor UOP, I/O. IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr.
   - Trend bladder pressures, CK, lactate
   - Follow urine culture (pending)
   - Maintain Hct > 25
   .
   # Rising CKs. Do not seem cardiac in nature as CK-MB are only
   proportionally elevated and troponins < 0.1. Concerned that this may
   relate to muscle breakdown secondary to compartment syndrome.
   - Trend CKs
   - Monitor for compartment syndrome as below
   - D/C statin (recently changed type/dose to 80 simvastatin) in acute
   setting
   ..
   # TACHYARRHYTHMIA/HISTORY OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. s/p PMP in [**2139**] in
   setting of CHB.  Pt initially in sinus rhythm, not paced, with RBBB in
   70s-90s. Later pt developed WCT, a-sensed v-paced, to 100s-120s, may
   have p waves present indicating this is a sinus tachycardia. In and out
   of sinus rhythm.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Hold home metoprolol in setting of active bleeding/hypovolemia
   - consider EP consult if other arrhythmias or if PM interrogation
   required.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS. Possibly related to bleeding, multiple transfusions.
   Still rising to 18 K today. Had episode of fever overnight so
   pan-cultured; sputum with multiple species of organisms. Pus at Foley
   site suggests one source of infection
   - Trend WBC, monitor temperature, CIS.
   - Follow urine, blood, sputum cultures (pending)
   - Tylenol for fever PRN
   - Leaving Foley in place for now as difficult to place (required
   urology)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG. EKG showed more pronounced T-wave inversions after
   episode of SOB on [**5-16**].
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes in setting of bleed; first two sets negative
   - Hold ASA in setting of active bleeding
   - Re-check EKG
   .

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve who was admitted for subtherapeutic INR. He presented with 2 days of low back pain and was found to have a retroperitoneal hematoma. He was intubated due to respiratory distress and hypotension, and was started on pressors. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. His current condition is complicated by acute renal failure, coagulopathy, and rising creatine kinase (CK) levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: The patient's elevated PIP, worsening creatinine, oliguria, and elevated CKs suggest the possibility of abdominal compartment syndrome. This is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and management.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, and he is at risk for bleeding complications. His history of atrial fibrillation and mechanical aortic valve also increase his risk for thromboembolic events.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is at risk for further renal damage due to hypovolemia and decreased perfusion to the kidneys.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and mechanical aortic valve increase his risk for cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and thromboembolic events.
5. Infection: The patient's rising white blood cell count and fever suggest the possibility of infection. His pus at the Foley site and positive Gram stain results support this diagnosis.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation increase his risk for respiratory complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and his current bleeding complications increase his risk for gastrointestinal complications, including bleeding and perforation.

Management:

1. Monitor the patient's abdominal compartment syndrome closely, and consider decompressive laparotomy if necessary.
2. Continue to manage the patient's coagulopathy with fresh frozen plasma and platelet transfusions as needed.
3. Optimize the patient's fluid status and renal function to prevent further renal damage.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, and consider anticoagulation therapy to prevent thromboembolic events.
5. Treat the patient's infection with appropriate antibiotics, and consider further evaluation with imaging studies or surgical intervention if necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status, and consider weaning him from mechanical ventilation if possible.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely, and consider further evaluation with imaging studies or endoscopy if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old man with respiratory failure who was intubated overnight. He has a history of coagulopathy and is currently receiving aggressive transfusions to aim for a hematocrit of 27. He is also experiencing acute renal failure, with urine output dropping off, and is at risk for intrabdominal compartment syndrome due to rising creatine kinase (CK) and lactate levels. He is sedated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a plateau pressure of 26 cmH2O and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and he requires continued mechanical ventilation to support his respiratory function.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is a risk factor for bleeding complications, and he requires continued monitoring and management of his coagulation status.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is a concern, and he requires continued monitoring of his urine output and electrolyte levels.
4. Intrabdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's rising CK and lactate levels suggest the possibility of intrabdominal compartment syndrome, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
5. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia suggest the possibility of cardiovascular instability, which is a risk factor for cardiac arrest.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and mechanical ventilation put him at risk for neurological complications, such as seizures or brain injury.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation to support the patient's respiratory function.
2. Monitor the patient's coagulation status and bleeding risk closely.
3. Monitor the patient's urine output and electrolyte levels closely to manage his acute renal failure.
4. Consider consultation with a specialist in critical care medicine to manage the patient's intrabdominal compartment syndrome.
5. Consider consultation with a specialist in infectious diseases to manage the patient's sepsis.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular stability closely and consider consultation with a specialist in cardiology if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and consider consultation with a specialist in neurology if necessary."
