   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 96**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Known lastname 8991**] is 73 year-old woman with prior history of PAFib on
   coumadin s/p PPM with recent myocardial bridge s/p stent and bleeding 2
   weeks ago who presented with SOB and was found to have a pericardial
   effusion and tamponade physiology.  She is now s/p cardiac cath and
   pericardiocentesis, feeling well.
   .
   #. Pericardial Effusion - Patient with myocardial bridge and stent 2
   weeks ago complicated with bleeding requiring balloon tamponade.  She
   had large pericardial effusion and signs of tamponade on echo and R
   cardiac cath. The size of the effusion suggests that it has been
   accumulating for the last 2 weeks and is not something acute. Now she
   does not have any pulsus and has a drain in place, draining minimal
   fluid overnight.
   - Follow up daily pulsus for evidence of tamponade
   - Flush drain with 5cc of NS q8 hours; if no drainage for the next 6
   hours (1500), will pull drain
   - Repeat echocardiogram today
   - Hold coumadin at this time, INR trending down at 2.0, CHADS2 score is
   1, may not need coumadin at this time.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - If bleeds, may need another stent and/or urgent CT surgery
   - F/u Hct at 2pm to make sure stable
   .
   #. Rhythm - Patient with PAFib rate controlled with diltiazem 120 mg
   daily and was anticoagulated at home with 10 mg of coumadin.
   - Continue diltiazem 120 SR daily
   - Continue digoxin as this was her home regimen and it is beneficial
   for her
   - Holding coumadin given bleeding
   - Currently in NSR
   - Continue rate control with diltiazem 120 mg po daily
   .
   Respiratory Wheezing: had excess fluid in cath/intervention.
   - Will give Lasix 20 mg  IV x 1.
   - Continue O2 and wean as tolerated
   #. Pump - No signs of failure.  Some concern for fluid overload with
   new mild wheezing on exam, no complaints of SOB.
   - CXR this am pending
   - Will try ipratropium nebs to see if this helps wheezing.
   - Stop IVF at this time.
   .
   #. CAD - Patient with no CAD and myocardial bridge s/p stent.
   - Plavix 75 mg po daily
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need ASA [**Last Name (LF) 9003**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ask interventional cardiology their
   opinion
   - No need for further therapy
   .
   #. Dyslipidemia - Continuing home dose of pravastatin

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note

   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: today
s echocardiogram shows ?
   residual clot in pericardial space with minimal free flowing fluid;
   ventricular function is normal and valves look fine;  I am somewhat
   concerned about the possibility of an effusive constrictive evolution
   of this pericardial problem, and she will need serial echocardiographic
   monitoring post discharge
   Above discussed extensively with patient.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of PAFib, myocardial bridge, and stent placement 2 weeks ago, who presented with shortness of breath and was found to have a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology. She underwent cardiac catheterization and pericardiocentesis, and is currently being monitored in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/69 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, and she is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination is notable for mild diffuse wheezing bilaterally, no rales or rhonchi, and good air movement. Her heart examination reveals a normal sinus rhythm, with a pulse rate of 76 beats per minute, and a blood pressure of 136/69 mmHg. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no masses or organomegaly.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 418 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a serum creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen of 14 mg/dL.

The patient's pericardial fluid analysis shows a total protein of 5.6 g/dL, glucose of 104 mg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 839 U/L. Her pericardial fluid hematology shows a white blood cell count of 1833 cells/uL, with a differential of 61% polymorphonuclear cells, 31% lymphocytes, and 8% monocytes.

Based on the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results, the potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Effusive constrictive pericarditis: The patient's echocardiogram shows residual clot in the pericardial space with minimal free flowing fluid, which may lead to effusive constrictive pericarditis.
2. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology may lead to cardiac tamponade, which can cause cardiovascular collapse and death.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's mild diffuse wheezing bilaterally and respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute may indicate respiratory failure.
4. Septicemia: The patient's white blood cell count of 10.2 K/uL and platelet count of 418 K/uL may indicate septicemia.
5. Renal failure: The patient's serum creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen of 14 mg/dL may indicate renal failure.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's history of bleeding complications and anticoagulation therapy may lead to bleeding complications.

Based on the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results, the plan of care includes:

1. Daily pulsus examination for evidence of tamponade.
2. Flush drain with 5cc of normal saline every 8 hours, and consider pulling the drain if no drainage is seen for 6 hours.
3. Repeat echocardiogram today to assess for residual clot and free flowing fluid.
4. Hold coumadin therapy and monitor the patient's international normalized ratio (INR) to ensure it does not exceed 2.0.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider increasing oxygen therapy if necessary.
6. Consider ipratropium nebs to help alleviate wheezing.
7. Stop IV fluids and consider oral fluids once the patient's drain is removed.
8. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust therapy as necessary.
9. Consider serial echocardiographic monitoring post-discharge to assess for effusive constrictive pericarditis."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 96**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Known lastname 8991**] is 73 year-old woman with prior history of PAFib on
   coumadin s/p PPM with recent myocardial bridge s/p stent and bleeding 2
   weeks ago who presented with SOB and was found to have a pericardial
   effusion and tamponade physiology.  She is now s/p cardiac cath and
   pericardiocentesis, feeling well.
   .
   #. Pericardial Effusion - Patient with myocardial bridge and stent 2
   weeks ago complicated with bleeding requiring balloon tamponade.  She
   had large pericardial effusion and signs of tamponade on echo and R
   cardiac cath. The size of the effusion suggests that it has been
   accumulating for the last 2 weeks and is not something acute. Now she
   does not have any pulsus and has a drain in place, draining minimal
   fluid overnight.
   - Follow up serial pulsus for evidence of tamponade
   - Flush drain with 5cc of NS q8 hours
   - Repeat echocardiogram today
   - Hold coumadin at this time, INR trending down at 2.0
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - If bleeds, may need another stent and/or urgent CT surgery
   - F/u Hct at 2pm to make sure stable
   .
   #. Rhythm - Patient with PAFib rate controlled with diltiazem 120 mg
   daily and was anticoagulated at home with 10 mg of coumadin.
   - Holding coumadin given bleeding
   - Currently in NSR
   - Continue rate control with diltiazem 120 mg po daily
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of failure.  Some concern for fluid overload with
   new mild wheezing on exam, no complaints of SOB.
   - CXR this am
   - Will try ipratropium nebs to see if this helps wheezing.
   - Stop IVF at this time.
   .
   #. CAD - Patient with no CAD and myocardial bridge s/p stent.
   - Plavix 75 mg po daily
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need ASA desensitation vs. Plavix [**Hospital1 7**] for stent
   - No need for further therapy
   .
   #. Dyslipidemia - Continuing home dose of pravastatin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of PAFib, recent myocardial bridge, and stent placement two weeks ago. She presented with shortness of breath and was found to have a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology. She underwent cardiac catheterization and pericardiocentesis, and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 136/69 mmHg, heart rate of 76 bpm, and respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula. Her physical examination is notable for mild diffuse wheezing bilaterally, but no other abnormalities.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 418 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L.

The patient has a pericardial effusion, with a drain in place that is draining minimal fluid overnight. She is being monitored for evidence of tamponade and will have serial pulsus examinations. Her coumadin has been held due to bleeding, and her international normalized ratio (INR) is trending down to 2.0.

The patient's rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm, and she is being monitored for any signs of arrhythmia. Her cardiac output is not compromised, and she does not have any signs of cardiac failure.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, but no evidence of significant coronary artery disease on cardiac catheterization. She is being treated with Plavix 75 mg daily, and will need ASA desensitization vs. Plavix in the future.

The patient's dyslipidemia is being managed with pravastatin at home, and she is being fed a cardiac/heart-healthy diet. She is at risk for fluid overload, and will have a chest X-ray and will be given ipratropium nebs to help with wheezing.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Tamponade physiology: The patient's pericardial effusion could continue to accumulate and cause tamponade physiology, leading to cardiac arrest.
* Bleeding: The patient's bleeding risk is increased due to her history of bleeding and her current INR of 2.0.
* Arrhythmia: The patient's rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm, but she is at risk for arrhythmia due to her history of PAFib and her current medication regimen.
* Fluid overload: The patient is at risk for fluid overload due to her history of cardiac catheterization and her current fluid status.
* Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her indwelling lines and her current immunosuppressed state.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she requires close monitoring for any signs of complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 96**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Known lastname 8991**] is 73 year-old woman with prior history of PAFib on
   coumadin s/p PPM with recent myocardial bridge s/p stent and bleeding 2
   weeks ago who presented with SOB and was found to have a pericardial
   effusion and tamponade physiology.  She is now s/p cardiac cath and
   pericardiocentesis, feeling well.
   .
   #. Pericardial Effusion - Patient with myocardial bridge and stent 2
   weeks ago complicated with bleeding requiring balloon tamponade.  She
   had large pericardial effusion and signs of tamponade on echo and R
   cardiac cath. The size of the effusion suggests that it has been
   accumulating for the last 2 weeks and is not something acute. Now she
   does not have any pulsus and has a drain in place, draining minimal
   fluid overnight.
   - Follow up daily pulsus for evidence of tamponade
   - Flush drain with 5cc of NS q8 hours; if no drainage for the next 6
   hours (1500), will pull drain
   - Repeat echocardiogram today
   - Hold coumadin at this time, INR trending down at 2.0, CHADS2 score is
   1, may not need coumadin at this time.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - If bleeds, may need another stent and/or urgent CT surgery
   - F/u Hct at 2pm to make sure stable
   .
   #. Rhythm - Patient with PAFib rate controlled with diltiazem 120 mg
   daily and was anticoagulated at home with 10 mg of coumadin.
   - Continue diltiazem 120 SR daily
   - Continue digoxin as this was her home regimen and it is beneficial
   for her
   - Holding coumadin given bleeding
   - Currently in NSR
   - Continue rate control with diltiazem 120 mg po daily
   .
   Respiratory Wheezing: had excess fluid in cath/intervention.
   - Will give Lasix 20 mg  IV x 1.
   - Continue O2 and wean as tolerated
   #. Pump - No signs of failure.  Some concern for fluid overload with
   new mild wheezing on exam, no complaints of SOB.
   - CXR this am pending
   - Will try ipratropium nebs to see if this helps wheezing.
   - Stop IVF at this time.
   .
   #. CAD - Patient with no CAD and myocardial bridge s/p stent.
   - Plavix 75 mg po daily
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need ASA [**Last Name (LF) 9003**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ask interventional cardiology their
   opinion
   - No need for further therapy
   .
   #. Dyslipidemia - Continuing home dose of pravastatin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient, a 73-year-old woman, is a post-pericardiocentesis and cardiac catheterization patient with a history of PAFib, stent placement, and bleeding two weeks ago. She presented with shortness of breath and was found to have a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology.

The patient is currently in the ICU, stable, and feeling well. She has a pericardial drain in place, which is draining minimal fluid overnight. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 136/69 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination is notable for mild diffuse wheezing bilaterally, no r/rh/wh, good air movement, and no accessory muscle use. Her cardiac examination reveals a normal sinus rhythm, with a pulse paradoxus <8cm.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, platelet count of 418 K/uL, and creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL. The pericardial fluid analysis shows a total protein of 5.6, glucose of 104, and LDH of 839.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Pericardial effusion: Follow up daily for evidence of tamponade, flush drain with 5cc of NS q8 hours, and repeat echocardiogram today.
2. Rhythm: Continue diltiazem 120 SR daily, digoxin as home regimen, and holding coumadin given bleeding.
3. Respiratory wheezing: Give Lasix 20 mg IV x 1, continue O2 and wean as tolerated, and consider ipratropium nebs.
4. Pump: No signs of failure, but concern for fluid overload with new mild wheezing on exam.
5. CAD: Continue Plavix 75 mg po daily and pravastatin as home dose.
6. Dyslipidemia: Continue home dose of pravastatin.
7. ICU care: Nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and communication.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pericardial effusion re-accumulation: The patient's pericardial effusion is not yet fully resolved, and there is a risk of re-accumulation.
2. Tamponade: The patient's tamponade physiology needs to be closely monitored, and further interventions may be necessary if it recurs.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's mild wheezing on exam and new fluid overload may lead to respiratory failure if not managed promptly.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of PAFib and recent stent placement make her prone to cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding two weeks ago and current bleeding risk with anticoagulation make her prone to further bleeding complications.
6. Infection: The patient's indwelling catheter and recent surgical interventions increase her risk of infection.
7. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload and mild wheezing on exam may lead to further complications if not managed promptly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old woman who underwent pericardiocentesis and cardiac catheterization for a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology. She is currently in the ICU and is being monitored for potential complications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 136/69 mmHg, heart rate of 76 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. Her respiratory status is also stable, with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute and a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 104 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a pericardial drain in place, which is draining minimal fluid overnight. Her cardiac examination reveals a normal sinus rhythm, with a pulse rate of 76 bpm and a blood pressure of 136/69 mmHg. Her lungs are clear to auscultation, and her abdomen is soft and nontender.

The patient's laboratory results are significant for a pericardial fluid with a total protein of 5.6 g/dL, glucose of 104 mg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 839 U/L. Her complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 10.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 418 K/uL.

The patient's medical history is significant for prior pericarditis, myocardial bridge, and stent placement two weeks ago. She also has a history of bleeding complications, including a recent episode of bleeding two weeks ago that required balloon tamponade.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Pericardial effusion: The patient's pericardial effusion is being monitored for evidence of tamponade, and the drain will be flushed with normal saline every eight hours. A repeat echocardiogram will be performed today to assess the size of the effusion.
2. Rhythm: The patient's rhythm is currently normal sinus rhythm, and she will continue to receive rate control with diltiazem 120 mg daily.
3. Pump: The patient's cardiac function is normal, and there are no signs of pump failure.
4. CAD: The patient has no CAD and will continue to receive Plavix 75 mg daily.
5. Dyslipidemia: The patient will continue to receive pravastatin at home.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Tamponade physiology: The patient's pericardial effusion can cause tamponade physiology, which can lead to cardiac tamponade, hypotension, and even cardiac arrest.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient's history of bleeding complications and recent episode of bleeding two weeks ago increase her risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and bleeding at the pericardial drain site.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of pericarditis and myocardial bridge increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she is at risk of developing respiratory complications, including pneumonia and respiratory failure.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infection, including pericarditis, pneumonia, and bloodstream infections.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she requires close monitoring for potential complications."

   There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION:
   Trivial residual pericardial effusion. Large pleural effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 96**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Known lastname 8991**] is 73 year-old woman with prior history of PAFib on
   coumadin s/p PPM with recent myocardial bridge s/p stent and bleeding 2
   weeks ago who presented with SOB and was found to have a pericardial
   effusion and tamponade physiology.  She is now s/p cardiac cath and
   pericardiocentesis, feeling well.
   .
   #. Pericardial Effusion - She had large pericardial effusion and signs
   of tamponade on echo and R cardiac cath. The size of the effusion
   suggests that it has been accumulating for the last 2 weeks and is not
   something acute. Now she does not have any pulsus and has a drain in
   place, draining minimal fluid overnight. Pulsus stable at 6 this
   morning. Elevated JVP
   - Follow up daily pulsus for evidence of tamponade
   - Hold coumadin at this time, INR trending down at 1.5, CHADS2 score is
   1, may not need coumadin at this time.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - If bleeds, may need another stent and/or urgent CT surgery
   - HCT stable.
   .
   #. Rhythm
 Sinsus this morning. Patient with PAFib rate controlled
   with diltiazem 120 mg daily. Stopped Coumadin for 6 months. INR this
   morning is 1.5.
   - Continue diltiazem 120 SR daily
   - Continue digoxin as this was her home regimen and it is beneficial
   for her
   - Holding coumadin given bleeding
   .
   Respiratory Wheezing: Improved this morning. Lasix 20mg IV x 2
   yesterday. Pt currently on 3L NC. Chest xray with large left sided
   pleural effusion. Possibly due to overhydration
   -          Continue O2 and wean as tolerated
   -          FU Chest Xray this morning. Plan for lateral and decub CXR
   today
   #. Pump
 EF preserved. Volume overload in the setting of tamponade.
   .
   #. CAD - Patient with no CAD and myocardial bridge s/p stent.
   - Plavix 75 mg po daily
   - ASA 81mg po daily
   .
   #. Dyslipidemia - Continuing home dose of pravastatin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 73-year-old woman, is a post-myocardial bridge with a history of PAFib and recent bleeding. She was admitted with a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology, which was treated with cardiac catheterization and pericardiocentesis. The patient has a pericardial drain in place, which is draining minimal fluid overnight. She has a stable pulsus and an elevated JVP.

The patient's rhythm is sinus, and she is taking diltiazem 120 SR daily for rate control. She is also taking digoxin as part of her home regimen. Coumadin was held due to bleeding, and the INR is trending down at 1.5.

The patient has a large left-sided pleural effusion, which may be due to overhydration. She is on 3L of oxygen and is being weaned as tolerated. A chest x-ray this morning showed a large left-sided pleural effusion, and a lateral and decubitus x-ray is planned for today.

The patient has preserved left ventricular systolic function and volume overload in the setting of tamponade. She has no evidence of CAD and has a myocardial bridge s/p stent. She is taking Plavix 75 mg daily and ASA 81 mg daily for CAD prevention.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Tamponade physiology: The patient's pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology may recur, leading to cardiac tamponade and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's large pleural effusion may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Infection: The patient's pericardial drain may become infected, leading to sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding risk is high due to her history of bleeding and the need for anticoagulation. She may require additional interventions to manage bleeding.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiovascular system is unstable due to her history of tamponade and pericardial effusion. She may require close monitoring and interventions to manage cardiovascular instability.
6. Worsening of pleural effusion: The patient's pleural effusion may worsen, leading to respiratory compromise and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Development of pneumonia: The patient's pleural effusion may increase the risk of developing pneumonia, which could lead to respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 96**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Known lastname 8991**] is 73 year-old woman with prior history of PAFib on
   coumadin s/p PPM with recent myocardial bridge s/p stent and bleeding 2
   weeks ago who presented with SOB and was found to have a pericardial
   effusion and tamponade physiology.  She is now s/p cardiac cath and
   pericardiocentesis, feeling well.
   .
   #. Pericardial Effusion - She had large pericardial effusion and signs
   of tamponade on echo and R cardiac cath. The size of the effusion
   suggests that it has been accumulating for the last 2 weeks and is not
   something acute. Now she does not have any pulsus and has a drain in
   place, draining minimal fluid overnight. Pulsus stable at 6 this
   morning.
   - Follow up daily pulsus for evidence of tamponade
   - Hold coumadin at this time, INR trending down at 1.5, CHADS2 score is
   1, may not need coumadin at this time.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - If bleeds, may need another stent and/or urgent CT surgery
   - HCT stable.
   .
   #. Rhythm
 Sinsus this morning. Patient with PAFib rate controlled
   with diltiazem 120 mg daily. Stopped Coumadin for 6 months. INR this
   morning is 1.5.
   - Continue diltiazem 120 SR daily
   - Continue digoxin as this was her home regimen and it is beneficial
   for her
   - Holding coumadin given bleeding
   .
   Respiratory Wheezing: Improved this morning. Lasix 20mg IV x 2
   yesterday. Pt currently on 3L NC. Chest xray with large left sided
   pleural effusion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, recent myocardial bridge, and bleeding two weeks ago. She presented with shortness of breath and was found to have a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology.

The patient has undergone cardiac catheterization and pericardiocentesis, and a pericardial drain was inserted. The drain has been draining minimal fluid overnight, and the patient's pulsus has stabilized at 6.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Pericardial effusion: The patient has a large pericardial effusion, which has been accumulating for the last two weeks. The effusion is not acute, and the patient does not have any signs of tamponade at this time.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is currently rate-controlled with diltiazem 120 mg daily.
3. Myocardial bridge: The patient has a myocardial bridge, which was stented recently.
4. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding two weeks ago, which required hospitalization.
5. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a high risk of developing a pulmonary embolism due to her history of atrial fibrillation and recent bleeding.

The patient's laboratory results show:

1. White blood cell count: 10.2-10.7 K/uL
2. Hematocrit: 29.5-31.5%
3. Platelet count: 418-427 K/uL
4. Creatinine: 0.6-0.7 mg/dL
5. Glucose: 135-138 mg/dL
6. Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL
7. Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
8. Phosphorus: 3.6 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

1. Chest X-ray: The patient has a large left-sided pleural effusion.
2. Echocardiogram: The patient has a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion, and overall left ventricular systolic function is normal.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Monitoring for evidence of tamponade
2. Holding coumadin at this time
3. Continuing to monitor on telemetry
4. If bleeding occurs, the patient may need another stent and/or urgent CT surgery
5. Continuing to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Tamponade: The patient's pericardial effusion may continue to accumulate, leading to tamponade physiology.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent bleeding increase her risk of developing a pulmonary embolism.
3. Bleeding: The patient may continue to bleed, which could require further intervention.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's large pleural effusion may cause respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac arrest: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent bleeding increase her risk of cardiac arrest."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 96**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Known lastname 8991**] is 73 year-old woman with prior history of PAFib on
   coumadin s/p PPM with recent myocardial bridge s/p stent and bleeding 2
   weeks ago who presented with SOB and was found to have a pericardial
   effusion and tamponade physiology.  She is now s/p cardiac cath and
   pericardiocentesis, feeling well.
   .
   #. Pericardial Effusion - She had large pericardial effusion and signs
   of tamponade on echo and R cardiac cath. The size of the effusion
   suggests that it has been accumulating for the last 2 weeks and is not
   something acute. Now she does not have any pulsus and has a drain in
   place, draining minimal fluid overnight. Pulsus stable at 6 this
   morning. Elevated JVP
   - Follow up daily pulsus for evidence of tamponade
   - Hold coumadin at this time, INR trending down at 1.5, CHADS2 score is
   1, may not need coumadin at this time.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - If bleeds, may need another stent and/or urgent CT surgery
   - HCT stable.
   .
   #. Rhythm
 Sinsus this morning. Patient with PAFib rate controlled
   with diltiazem 120 mg daily. Stopped Coumadin for 6 months. INR this
   morning is 1.5.
   - Continue diltiazem 120 SR daily
   - Continue digoxin as this was her home regimen and it is beneficial

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: She is in and out of atrial fib.  I
   am concerned about the possibility of constriction.  She has a fairly
   sizable burden of residual clot in the pericardial space, and she has a
   Kussmaul sign.  Her large left pleural effusion is also of concern.  I
   am hoping that this is due simply to aggressive volume loading.
   However, it is necessary to follow this effusion to its spontaneous
   resolution, or else diagnose and treat it.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: She is in and out of atrial fib.  I
   am concerned about the possibility of constriction.  She has a fairly
   sizable burden of residual clot in the pericardial space, and she has a
   Kussmaul sign.  Her large left pleural effusion is also of concern.  I
   am hoping that this is due simply to aggressive volume loading.
   However, it is necessary to follow this effusion to its spontaneous
   resolution, or else diagnose and treat it.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

* The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of PAFib, recent myocardial bridge, and bleeding two weeks ago, who presented with SOB and was found to have a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology.
* She underwent cardiac catheterization and pericardiocentesis, and is currently in the ICU with a pericardial drain in place, draining minimal fluid overnight.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a pulse of 6, blood pressure of 102/52 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95% on 3L nasal cannula.
* The patient's physical examination reveals a well-appearing woman, with decreased air movement at the bases bilaterally, increased on the left, and a PMI located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
* Laboratory results show a WBC count of 10.2-10.7 K/uL, Hct of 29.5-31.5%, and platelet count of 418-427 K/uL.
* Imaging studies reveal a large pleural effusion on the left, with marked cardiomegaly and atelectasis on the left lung parenchyma.
* The patient is receiving diltiazem 120 SR daily, digoxin, and is holding coumadin due to bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Constriction due to residual clot in the pericardial space
* Infection of the pericardial drain or pleural effusion
* Development of pneumonia or other respiratory complications
* Volume overload or heart failure
* Bleeding or hemorrhage
* Cardiac arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities
* Respiratory failure or need for mechanical ventilation
* Sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)
* Pleural effusion or pneumothorax
* Cardiac tamponade or pericardial constriction

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications."
