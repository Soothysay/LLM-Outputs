You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma, possible spine metastases, and a history of protein-losing enteropathy. She presented with a seizure from home and was found to have likely new brain metastases. She is currently intubated and on ventilatory support due to respiratory failure. She has a history of MRSA and VRE bacteremia and is at risk for aspiration. She is also at risk for intracranial bleeding due to her atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, and blood pressure of 118/59 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, with a Vt of 500 mL and RR of 12.

The patient's lab results show a WBC count of 5.8 K/uL, Hct of 36.6%, and Plt of 347 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated Ca++ level of 8.0 mg/dL.

The patient's plan includes continuing levetiracetam and dexamethasone for seizure control, as well as ventilatory support. She will also undergo a brain MRI to better characterize the brain mass and will be followed up with neurosurgical recommendations. Her lung cancer treatment plan includes CyberKnife treatment, and she will be followed up with oncology recommendations. She will also be monitored for possible pneumonia and atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications:

1. Brain metastases: The patient's new brain metastases may lead to further neurological decline, seizures, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further decline in her oxygenation and ventilation status.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's history of MRSA and VRE bacteremia and her current intubation may increase her risk of developing pneumonia.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and potentially life-threatening cardiac events.
5. Protein-losing enteropathy: The patient's history of protein-losing enteropathy may lead to further malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances, potentially worsening her overall condition.
6. Intracranial bleeding: The patient's atrial fibrillation and history of bleeding complications may increase her risk of intracranial bleeding, potentially leading to further neurological decline and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Seizure control: The patient's seizure control may be challenging, and further complications may arise from her seizures, such as status epilepticus or further neurological decline."

   Plan:
   # Seizure with altered mental status: most likely from new brain
   lesion, which is concerning for brain mets from her lung ca. Not a good
   surgical candidate.
   - continue levetiracetam 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of lung adenocarcinoma, possible spine mets, and protein-losing enteropathy. She presented with a seizure and was found to have likely new brain mets. She is currently intubated and requires ventilatory support. The patient's condition is complicated by atrial fibrillation, which is currently in sinus rhythm, and a history of MRSA and VRE bacteremia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure recurrence: The patient's seizure may recur due to the presence of new brain mets, which could lead to further neurological compromise.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to her underlying lung disease and the presence of pneumonia.
3. Infection: The patient's history of MRSA and VRE bacteremia increases her risk of developing further infections, particularly pneumonia.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen and lead to cardiac complications, such as heart failure or stroke.
5. Protein-losing enteropathy: The patient's protein-losing enteropathy may worsen due to her underlying condition and the presence of malnutrition.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition may worsen due to her inability to eat and her underlying condition.
7. Intracranial bleeding: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the presence of new brain mets increase her risk of intracranial bleeding.
8. Sepsis: The patient's underlying condition and the presence of infections increase her risk of developing sepsis.
9. Multi-organ failure: The patient's underlying condition and the presence of infections increase her risk of developing multi-organ failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with recently diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma, possible spine metastases, and a history of protein-losing enteropathy. She presented with a seizure from home, found to have likely new brain metastases. She is currently intubated and receiving ventilatory support due to her inability to protect her airway. She has a history of MRSA bacteremia and VRE from an abdominal wound, and is being treated with empiric antibiotics. She also has atrial fibrillation, currently in sinus rhythm, and is being treated with diltiazem. She is planned to undergo CyberKnife treatment for her lung cancer.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Brain Metastases:** The patient's new brain metastases are a significant concern, and may require further treatment, such as radiation or chemotherapy.
2. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's acute respiratory failure may require continued ventilatory support, and may be complicated by pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
3. **Pneumonia:** The patient's opacity in the right upper lobe (RUL) is concerning for aspiration, and may require further investigation and treatment.
4. **Infection:** The patient's history of MRSA bacteremia and VRE from an abdominal wound, and her current treatment with empiric antibiotics, may increase her risk of developing further infections.
5. **Coagulopathy:** The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and her current treatment with warfarin may increase her risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of intracranial bleeding.
6. **Malnutrition:** The patient's history of protein-losing enteropathy and her current nutritional status may increase her risk of malnutrition, particularly if she is unable to tolerate enteral nutrition.
7. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient's history of abdominal surgeries for small bowel obstruction (SBO) may increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
8. **Cardiovascular Complications:** The patient's atrial fibrillation and her current treatment with diltiazem may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with recently diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma, suspected spine metastases, and likely new brain metastases. She presented with a seizure and was found to have respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on ventilatory support. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, neutrophilia, and mild anemia. She has a history of protein-losing enteropathy and has undergone abdominal surgeries for small bowel obstruction. She is also experiencing atrial fibrillation, which is currently in sinus rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to her underlying lung disease, brain metastases, and possible aspiration pneumonia.
2. Seizure recurrence: The patient's seizure may recur, and she may require further anticonvulsant therapy.
3. Brain metastases progression: The patient's brain metastases may progress, leading to further neurological deficits and potential complications.
4. Pneumonia progression: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure and potential sepsis.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to potential complications such as stroke or cardiac arrest.
6. Protein-losing enteropathy: The patient's protein-losing enteropathy may worsen, leading to further malnutrition and potential complications.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's DVT and IVC filter placement may increase her risk of developing a pulmonary embolism.
8. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and respiratory failure may increase her risk of developing an infection.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's protein-losing enteropathy and history of abdominal surgeries may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
10. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition and protein-losing enteropathy may lead to nutritional deficiencies, which may worsen her overall health."

 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   76-year-old woman with recently diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma with
   possible spine mets, history of protein-losing enteropathy, presented
   with seizure from home, found to have likely new brain mets.
   .
   Plan:
   # Seizure with altered mental status: most likely from new brain
   lesion, which is concerning for brain mets from her lung ca. Not a good
   surgical candidate.
   - continue levetiracetam 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - continue dexamethasone 4mg q6h
   - Has required ventilatory support given inability to protect airway.
   Consider extubation today
   - f/u neurosurg recs
   - brain MRI for better characterization of brain mass
   .
   # Lung cancer: recent transbronchial biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma.
   With suspected spine mets and now with likely new brain mets. Likely
   stage IV. Has been planned to undergo CyberKnife treatment.
   - f/u oncology recs re: further management
   .
   # Possible pneumonia: with opacity in RUL, concerning for aspiration in
   the setting of seizure. Patient does have a history of MRSA bacteremia
   and VRE from abdominal wound.
   - empiric pip-tazo and vanco for now given patient's history of
   frequent hospitalizations; will narrow abx if clinical status and
   culture data permit
   - f/u repeat CXR today.
   - sputum cx if available
   - blood cx
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: currently in sinus rhythm.
   - continue dilt 60 mg q8h
   - hold warfarin given risk of intracranial bleeding; INR 1.0 currently
   .
   # Protein-losing enteropathy: most recently on TPN in [**2191-5-26**]. S/p abd
   surgeries for SBO.
   - consider restarting TPN for nutrional support if still intubated;
   otherwise, will start PO diet once extubated

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient is a 62-inch tall adult with a history of adenocarcinoma lung and multiple brain nodules on MRI. They have been experiencing respiratory failure, acute, secondary to a seizure and inability to protect their airway. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 73 beats per minute, blood pressure of 135/62 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. They are receiving prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin and stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor.

The patient has a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in their right leg, which was diagnosed by ultrasound and treated with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement. They are also experiencing leukocytosis, likely secondary to steroid use.

The patient's laboratory results show normal kidney function, with a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, and normal liver function, with a total bilirubin level of 0.4 mg/dL. Their complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 11.7 K/uL, and their electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient's plan includes continuing keppra and dexamethasone for seizure management, and once extubated, they will be updated on treatment options for their adenocarcinoma. They will also continue to receive respiratory support and prophylactic anticoagulation.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism: Given the patient's DVT and IVC filter placement, there is a risk of pulmonary embolism.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress to chronic respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and respiratory failure increase their risk of developing sepsis.
4. Leukemia: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of underlying leukemia or other hematological disorders.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's heart rate and blood pressure may fluctuate, increasing their risk of cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's brain nodules and seizure history increase their risk of developing neurological complications such as stroke or increased intracranial pressure.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   76-year-old woman with recently diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma with
   possible spine mets, history of protein-losing enteropathy, presented
   with seizure from home, found to have new brain mets.
   .
   Plan:
   # Seizure with altered mental status: most likely from new brain
   lesion, which are most likely brain mets from her lung ca. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of
   neurosurgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] yesterday and stated he does not think there
   is a role for neurosurgery at this pt. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] from Rad onc also came
   by and talked with the family who would like to pursue total brain
   radiation to begin today or tomorrow- he will be by again today to
   consent the pt.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**] from heme/onc was also here yesterday for
   a family mtg where they discussed the pt's current situation and total
   brain radiation was decided as the preferable option at this time. The
   family and pt also made her status DNR/DNI last night
   - continue levetiracetam 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - continue dexamethasone 4mg q6h
   - Rad onc to consent pt and start total brain radiation today or
   tomorrow
   .
   # Lung cancer: recent transbronchial biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma.
   With suspected spine mets and now with new brain mets. Stage IV.
   -Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**] is primary oncologist and following pt
   -Rad onc to start total brain radiation as above.
   .
   # Pneumonia: with opacity in RUL, concerning for aspiration in the
   setting of seizure, but more likley CAP. Sputum culture with no growth
   to date.
   - Day 3 ceftriaxone today
   - f/u sputum cx
   - blood cx pend
   .
   # RLE DVT: IVC filter placed [**10-28**]
   - hold off on coumadin given risk of bleeding with brain mets
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: currently in sinus rhythm.
   - continue dilt 60 mg q8h
   - hold warfarin given risk of intracranial bleeding; INR 1.0 currently
   .
   # Protein-losing enteropathy: most recently on TPN in [**2191-5-26**]. S/p abd
   surgeries for SBO.
   - will discuss possible need for speech and swallow eval and/or
   nutrition consult today. Pt needs to be started on PO diet if possible.
   Nursing notes she is taking pills with liquids with no coughing or
   other signs of aspiration at this time.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   76-year-old woman with recently diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma with
   possible spine mets, history of protein-losing enteropathy, presented
   with seizure from home, found to have new brain mets.
   .
   Plan:
   # Seizure with altered mental status: most likely from new brain
   lesion, which are most likely brain mets from her lung ca. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of
   neurosurgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] yesterday and stated he does not think there
   is a role for neurosurgery at this pt. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] from Rad onc also came
   by and talked with the family who would like to pursue total brain
   radiation to begin today or tomorrow- he will be by again today to
   consent the pt.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**] from heme/onc was also here yesterday for
   a family mtg where they discussed the pt's current situation and total
   brain radiation was decided as the preferable option at this time. The
   family and pt also made her status DNR/DNI last night
   - continue levetiracetam 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - continue dexamethasone 4mg q6h
   - Rad onc to consent pt and start total brain radiation today or
   tomorrow
   .
   # Lung cancer: recent transbronchial biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma.
   With suspected spine mets and now with new brain mets. Stage IV.
   -Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**] is primary oncologist and following pt
   -Rad onc to start total brain radiation as above.
   .
   # Pneumonia: with opacity in RUL, concerning for aspiration in the
   setting of seizure, but more likley CAP. Sputum culture with no growth
   to date.
   - Day 3 ceftriaxone today
   - f/u sputum cx
   - blood cx pend

   # RLE DVT: IVC filter placed [**10-28**]
   - hold off on coumadin given risk of bleeding with brain mets
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: currently in sinus rhythm.
   - continue dilt 60 mg q8h
   - hold warfarin given risk of intracranial bleeding; INR 1.0 currently
   .
   # Protein-losing enteropathy: most recently on TPN in [**2191-5-26**]. S/p abd
   surgeries for SBO.
   - will discuss possible need for speech and swallow eval and/or
   nutrition consult today. Pt needs to be started on PO diet if possible.
   Nursing notes she is taking pills with liquids with no coughing or
   other signs of aspiration at this time.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of lung adenocarcinoma, protein-losing enteropathy, and recent diagnosis of brain metastases. She presented with a seizure and was intubated for airway protection.

The patient was successfully extubated and is currently off invasive ventilation. She is expected to be transferred to the floor in the morning.

The patient has the following medical conditions:

1. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremity, for which an IVC filter was placed.
2. Seizure, likely related to new brain metastases.
3. Respiratory failure, acute, not related to ARDS.
4. Lung cancer, stage IV, with suspected spine and brain metastases.
5. Pneumonia, with opacity in the right upper lobe, likely community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
6. Atrial fibrillation, currently in sinus rhythm.
7. Protein-losing enteropathy, with a history of abdominal surgeries for small bowel obstruction (SBO).

The patient is currently receiving the following medications:

1. Levetiracetam for seizure control.
2. Dexamethasone for brain edema.
3. Ceftriaxone for pneumonia.
4. Diltiazem for atrial fibrillation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung with multiple CNS lesions on MRI. The patient has undergone invasive ventilation, which was stopped 24 hours ago, and is now off mechanical ventilation without respiratory complaints.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
* Heart rate: 64 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 116/52 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Thin
* Eyes and conjunctiva: PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light)
* Head, ears, nose, and throat: Normocephalic
* Lymphatic: Cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes are normal
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds
* Respiratory: Crackles in the bases of the lungs with deep breathing
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present
* Extremities: Right radial pulse and left radial pulse are present, but left DP pulse is absent, with RLE edema improved
* Skin: Warm
* Neurological: Attentive, responds to name and year, but not assessed for movement, tone, or reflexes

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 11.6 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 5.8 K/uL
* Platelet count: 58 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 153 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 13.4/45.3/1.1, ALT/AST: 6-2, Alk Phos/T Bili: 145/0.4, differential-neuts: 83.6%, lymph: 14.7%, mono: 1.4%, eos: 0.1%, albumin: 2.8 g/dL, LDH: 245 IU/L, Ca++: 8.3 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.3 mg/dL, PO4: 2.8 mg/dL

The patient's medical complications include:

* Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremity, which has been treated with IVC filter placement
* Seizure, which is being managed with keppra
* Respiratory failure, acute, which has been treated with invasive ventilation and is now off mechanical ventilation
* Aspiration pneumonia, which is being treated with CTX

The patient's plan includes:

* Whole brain irradiation for metastatic adenocarcinoma
* Continuation of keppra and decadron for seizure management
* Completion of course of CTX for aspiration pneumonia
* Transfer to the floor once stable

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Pneumonia or respiratory failure due to continued respiratory compromise
* Bleeding or hemorrhage due to the patient's coagulopathy
* Infection or sepsis due to the patient's immunocompromised state
* Cardiac complications due to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease
* Neurological complications due to the patient's metastatic disease and potential cerebral edema
* Gastrointestinal complications due to the patient's underlying cancer and potential bowel obstruction or perforation."
