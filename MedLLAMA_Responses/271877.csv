   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD admitted to an OSH
   with SOB now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia
   1. Hypoxia: Has LLL infiltrate on CXR though degree of hypoxia seems to
   greater than might be expected to be accounted for by this.  Earlier in
   stay at OSH had pO2 of 51.  Given the degree of hypoxia shunt
   physiology is possible; echo with bubbles at OSH did not reveal any
   intracardiac shunt.  Given his cirrhosis, hepatopulmonary has been
   entertained though OSH bubble study was negative.  Appears to have been
   on steroids for long periods so PCP is [**Name Initial (PRE) **] consideration as well.
   - Treat as HAP for now with vanco/zosyn
   - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider adding
   caspo or vori
   - BiPAP overnight
   - Repeat ABG in AM
   - Consider CT chest
   - Consider repeat echo with bubbles here
   2. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegay and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.
   - Start lactulose/rifaximin
   - Guaiac stools
   - Consider para to evaluate for SBP
   3. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   4. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppresions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.
   - Check retic ct, iron studies, B12, folate
   5. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. If does not improve
   further, can eval for SIADH.
   6. Renal failure: Unclear baseline.  Does have elevated BUN/Cr ratio
   which may represent prerenal state or GIB.
   - Follow and try to determine baseline status
   7. Diarrhea: Was being treated as c.diff though toxin negative. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have also been due to lactulose.
   - Will resend c.diff here
   - Hold on PO vanco or flagyl unless decompensates or toxin returns
   positive
   8. COPD: Initially treated as primary diagnosis at time of admission to
   OSH. On steroid taper at OSH and appears to have recieved 50mg on day
   of transfer.
   - Continue taper
   - Albuterol/atrovent
   FEN: NPO while mental status is poor
   PPX: SC heparin; PPI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   1. Hypoxia: Has LLL infiltrate on CXR though degree of hypoxia seems to
   greater than might be expected to be accounted for by this.  Earlier in
   stay at OSH had pO2 of 51.  Given the degree of hypoxia shunt
   physiology is possible; echo with bubbles at OSH did not reveal any
   intracardiac shunt.  Given his cirrhosis, hepatopulmonary has been
   entertained though OSH bubble study was negative.  Appears to have been
   on steroids for long periods so PCP is [**Name Initial (PRE) **] consideration as well.
   - Treat as HAP for now with vanco/zosyn
   - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider adding
   caspo or vori
   - BiPAP overnight
   - Repeat ABG in AM
   - Consider CT chest
   - Consider repeat echo with bubbles here
   2. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegay and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.
   - Start lactulose/rifaximin
   - Guaiac stools
   - Consider para to evaluate for SBP
   3. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   4. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppresions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.
   - Check retic ct, iron studies, B12, folate
   5. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. If does not improve
   further, can eval for SIADH.
   6. Renal failure: Unclear baseline.  Does have elevated BUN/Cr ratio
   which may represent prerenal state or GIB.
   - Follow and try to determine baseline status
   7. Diarrhea: Was being treated as c.diff though toxin negative. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have also been due to lactulose.
   - Will resend c.diff here
   - Hold on PO vanco or flagyl unless decompensates or toxin returns
   positive
   8. COPD: Initially treated as primary diagnosis at time of admission to
   OSH. On steroid taper at OSH and appears to have recieved 50mg on day
   of transfer.
   - Continue taper
   - Albuterol/atrovent
   FEN: NPO while mental status is poor

   ECHO:  The left atrium is elongated. No thrombus/mass is seen in the
   body of the left atrium. A patent foramen ovale is present. A
   right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function
   are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no
   ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
   No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no
   valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely
   related to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is
   seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Patent foramen ovale.
   ABD Ultrasound: 1. Limited study due to respiratory motion. Portal
   venous system appears patent with reversed flow. Hepatic arterial and
   hepatic venous systems are grossly patent.   2. Small amount of
   ascites.    3. Heterogeneous, coarsened liver echotexture, consistent
   with the patient's history of cirrhosis.    4. Cholelithiasis.
   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD admitted to an OSH
   with SOB now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia
   1. Hypoxia: Multiple processes could be contributing: Cardiac shunt,
   PE, intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, and HPS.  Patient
s O2 sats now
   >90% by keeping MAPs > 70 with levophed and blood products.  Levophed
   has been weaned somewhat overnight with platelets and FFP.  Suggests
   that shunting may be playing a significant role.  To address these
   different possible etiologies:
    - Cardiac shunt
 evidence for this with PFO on TTE on [**3-28**], plan for
   RH cath on [**3-29**].  Will discuss with cardiology and try to obtain some
   dynamic measurements of function with NO, decreasing levophed, and
   other maneuvers.
    - PE
 possible given patient
s prolonged OSH course.  Have deferred
   starting heparin given pending HIT Ab panel.  As hypoxia improved today
   will plan to get CTA chest.
    - Intrinsic lung disease
 history of IPF from OSH notes, but does not
   appear so based on CXR.  Path from OSH biopsy now in [**State 5354**] and
   unobtainable for several days.  Will get further info with chest CT.
    - Infection / PNA - has LLL infiltrate on CXR though cannot account
   for all of the patient
s hypoxia.
             - Cont. vanco/zosyn for HAP,
             - check induced sputum for PCP given [**Name9 (PRE) 4849**] steroid use.
             - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider
   adding caspo or vori
    - HPS
 possible given underlying cirrhosis.  Will f/u hepatology recs
   as below.
   .
   2. Hypotension: Patient requiring levophed for blood pressure support
   and to help maintain O2 sats.  Underlying etiology unclear but may
   include sedation, shunt physiology, infection, and underlying liver
   disease.
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - w/u of other problems as above and below
   - consider PRBCs for additional intravascular volume
   3. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegay and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.  Patient with tender abdomen.
   Could potentially have SBP.
   - lactulose/rifaximin
   - Guaiac stools
   - diagnostic para with u/s guidance by IR today
   - f/u hepatology recs
   4. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, infection, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   - CT head
   5. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppresions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.  Hct 42 on initial
   presentation to OSH and between 38 and 40 until [**3-18**].  Unclear why the
   precipitous drop recently.  Retic count elevated (6.6), iron low, B12 &
   folate sufficient.
   - iron supplementation
   - guaiac stools
   6. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. If does not improve
   further, can eval for SIADH.
   7. Renal failure: Unclear baseline.  Does have elevated BUN/Cr ratio
   which may represent prerenal state or GIB.
   - Follow and try to determine baseline status
   8. Diarrhea: Was being treated as c.diff though toxin negative at OSH
   and again here. [**Month (only) 8**] have also been due to lactulose.
   - Will resend c.diff here once more
   - Hold on PO vanco or flagyl unless decompensates or toxin returns
   positive
   9. COPD: Initially treated as primary diagnosis at time of admission to
   OSH. On steroid taper at OSH and appears to have received 50mg on day
   of transfer.
   - Continue taper
   - Albuterol/atrovent

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   ECHO:  The left atrium is elongated. No thrombus/mass is seen in the
   body of the left atrium. A patent foramen ovale is present. A
   right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function
   are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no
   ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
   No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no
   valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely
   related to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is
   seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Patent foramen ovale.
   ABD Ultrasound: 1. Limited study due to respiratory motion. Portal
   venous system appears patent with reversed flow. Hepatic arterial and
   hepatic venous systems are grossly patent.   2. Small amount of
   ascites.    3. Heterogeneous, coarsened liver echotexture, consistent
   with the patient's history of cirrhosis.    4. Cholelithiasis.
   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD admitted to an OSH
   with SOB now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia
   1. Hypoxia: Multiple processes could be contributing: Cardiac shunt,
   PE, intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, and HPS.  Patient
s O2 sats now
   >90% by keeping MAPs > 70 with levophed and blood products.  Levophed
   has been weaned somewhat overnight with platelets and FFP.  Suggests
   that shunting may be playing a significant role.  To address these
   different possible etiologies:
    - Cardiac shunt
 evidence for this with PFO on TTE on [**3-28**], plan for
   RH cath on [**3-29**].  Will discuss with cardiology and try to obtain some
   dynamic measurements of function with NO, decreasing levophed, and
   other maneuvers.
    - PE
 possible given patient
s prolonged OSH course.  Have deferred
   starting heparin given pending HIT Ab panel.  As hypoxia improved today
   will plan to get CTA chest.
    - Intrinsic lung disease
 history of IPF from OSH notes, but does not
   appear so based on CXR.  Path from OSH biopsy now in [**State 5354**] and
   unobtainable for several days.  Will get further info with chest CT.
    - Infection / PNA - has LLL infiltrate on CXR though cannot account
   for all of the patient
s hypoxia.
             - Cont. vanco/zosyn for HAP,
             - check induced sputum for PCP given [**Name9 (PRE) 4849**] steroid use.
             - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider
   adding caspo or vori
    - HPS
 possible given underlying cirrhosis.  Will f/u hepatology recs
   as below.
   .
   2. Hypotension: Patient requiring levophed for blood pressure support
   and to help maintain O2 sats.  Underlying etiology unclear but may
   include sedation, shunt physiology, infection, and underlying liver
   disease.
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - w/u of other problems as above and below
   - consider PRBCs for additional intravascular volume
   3. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegay and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.  Patient with tender abdomen.
   Could potentially have SBP.
   - lactulose/rifaximin
   - Guaiac stools
   - diagnostic para with u/s guidance by IR today
   - f/u hepatology recs
   4. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, infection, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   - CT head
   5. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppresions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.  Hct 42 on initial
   presentation to OSH and between 38 and 40 until [**3-18**].  Unclear why the
   precipitous drop recently.  Retic count elevated (6.6), iron low, B12 &
   folate sufficient.
   - iron supplementation
   - guaiac stools
   6. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. If does not improve
   further, can eval for SIADH.
   7. Renal failure: Unclear baseline.  Does have elevated BUN/Cr ratio
   which may represent prerenal state or GIB.
   - Follow and try to determine baseline status
   8. Diarrhea: Was being treated as c.diff though toxin negative at OSH
   and again here. [**Month (only) 8**] have also been due to lactulose.
   - Will resend c.diff here once more
   - Hold on PO vanco or flagyl unless decompensates or toxin returns
   positive
   9. COPD: Initially treated as primary diagnosis at time of admission to
   OSH. On steroid taper at OSH and appears to have received 50mg on day
   of transfer.
   - Continue taper
   - Albuterol/atrovent

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD, and hypoxia. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe hypoxia and was intubated. The patient's condition has been stabilized with levophed and blood products, and his O2 sats have improved to >90%. However, his hypoxia is still unexplained, and multiple etiologies are being considered, including cardiac shunt, PE, intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, and HPS.

The patient's medical history is significant for cirrhosis, COPD, and IPF. He has a patent foramen ovale (PFO) on transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) and a right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum. He also has a history of infection, including a positive bronchial washings culture for Torulopsis glabrata.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and levophed. He is also receiving midazolam, fentanyl, and norepinephrine infusions.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, including ALT and AST, as well as an elevated INR. His blood cultures are pending, and he has a history of antibiotic use.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac shunt: The patient's PFO and right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum may be contributing to his hypoxia.
2. PE: The patient's prolonged OSH course and history of COPD make him at risk for developing a pulmonary embolism.
3. Intrinsic lung disease: The patient's history of IPF and current lung infiltrates on CXR may be contributing to his hypoxia.
4. Infection: The patient's history of infection, including a positive bronchial washings culture for Torulopsis glabrata, may be contributing to his hypoxia.
5. HPS: The patient's underlying cirrhosis and history of infection may be contributing to his hypoxia.
6. Renal failure: The patient's elevated BUN/Cr ratio may indicate prerenal azotemia or acute kidney injury.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and current liver disease may increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Diarrhea: The patient's history of diarrhea and current treatment with lactulose may increase his risk of electrolyte imbalance and dehydration.
9. COPD exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD and current lung infiltrates on CXR may increase his risk of COPD exacerbation.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Further evaluation of his hypoxia, including a right heart catheterization to evaluate cardiac shunt and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest to evaluate for PE.
2. Treatment of his infection, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.
3. Management of his liver disease, including lactulose and rifaximin.
4. Monitoring of his electrolyte levels and hydration status.
5. Management of his COPD, including albuterol and atrovent.
6. Further evaluation of his gastrointestinal bleeding, including guaiac stools and diagnostic para with ultrasound guidance.
7. Management of his anemia, including iron supplementation and guaiac stools.
8. Further evaluation of his renal function, including a repeat creatinine level and urine output.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires careful monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   ECHO:  The left atrium is elongated. No thrombus/mass is seen in the
   body of the left atrium. A patent foramen ovale is present. A
   right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function
   are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no
   ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
   No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no
   valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely
   related to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is
   seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Patent foramen ovale.
   ABD Ultrasound: 1. Limited study due to respiratory motion. Portal
   venous system appears patent with reversed flow. Hepatic arterial and
   hepatic venous systems are grossly patent.   2. Small amount of
   ascites.    3. Heterogeneous, coarsened liver echotexture, consistent
   with the patient's history of cirrhosis.    4. Cholelithiasis.
   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD admitted to an OSH
   with SOB now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia
   1. Hypoxia: Multiple processes could be contributing: Cardiac shunt,
   PE, intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, and HPS.  Patient
s O2 sats now
   >90% by keeping MAPs > 70 with levophed and blood products.  Levophed
   has been weaned somewhat overnight with platelets and FFP.  Suggests
   that shunting may be playing a significant role.  To address these
   different possible etiologies:
    - Cardiac shunt
 evidence for this with PFO on TTE on [**3-28**], plan for
   RH cath on [**3-29**].  Will discuss with cardiology and try to obtain some
   dynamic measurements of function with NO, decreasing levophed, and
   other maneuvers.
    - PE
 possible given patient
s prolonged OSH course.  Have deferred
   starting heparin given pending HIT Ab panel.  As hypoxia improved today
   will plan to get CTA chest.
    - Intrinsic lung disease
 history of IPF from OSH notes, but does not
   appear so based on CXR.  Path from OSH biopsy now in [**State 5354**] and
   unobtainable for several days.  Will get further info with chest CT.
    - Infection / PNA - has LLL infiltrate on CXR though cannot account
   for all of the patient
s hypoxia.
             - Cont. vanco/zosyn for HAP,
             - check induced sputum for PCP given [**Name9 (PRE) 4849**] steroid use.
             - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider
   adding caspo or vori
    - HPS
 possible given underlying cirrhosis.  Will f/u hepatology recs
   as below.
   .
   2. Hypotension: Patient requiring levophed for blood pressure support
   and to help maintain O2 sats.  Underlying etiology unclear but may
   include sedation, shunt physiology, infection, and underlying liver
   disease.
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - w/u of other problems as above and below
   - consider PRBCs for additional intravascular volume
   3. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegay and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.  Patient with tender abdomen.
   Could potentially have SBP.
   - lactulose/rifaximin
   - Guaiac stools
   - diagnostic para with u/s guidance by IR today
   - f/u hepatology recs
   4. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, infection, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   - CT head
   5. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppresions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.  Hct 42 on initial
   presentation to OSH and between 38 and 40 until [**3-18**].  Unclear why the
   precipitous drop recently.  Retic count elevated (6.6), iron low, B12 &
   folate sufficient.
   - iron supplementation
   - guaiac stools
   6. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. If does not improve
   further, can eval for SIADH.
   7. Renal failure: Unclear baseline.  Does have elevated BUN/Cr ratio
   which may represent prerenal state or GIB.
   - Follow and try to determine baseline status
   8. Diarrhea: Was being treated as c.diff though toxin negative at OSH
   and again here. [**Month (only) 8**] have also been due to lactulose.
   - Will resend c.diff here once more
   - Hold on PO vanco or flagyl unless decompensates or toxin returns
   positive
   9. COPD: Initially treated as primary diagnosis at time of admission to
   OSH. On steroid taper at OSH and appears to have received 50mg on day
   of transfer.
   - Continue taper
   - Albuterol/atrovent
   FEN: NaHCO3 at 100cc/hr pre-medication for cardiac cath; place NGT
   today & start tube feeds with nutrition consult

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a history of ascites, who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with hypoxia, hypotension, and altered mental status. He has a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and a possible cardiac shunt. He is receiving levophed and blood products to maintain oxygen saturation and blood pressure. He has a history of IPF, and the possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE) is being considered. He has a low albumin level and elevated INR, and is at risk for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He has a tender abdomen and is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. Cardiac shunt: The patient's PFO and possible cardiac shunt may lead to continued hypoxia and respiratory failure.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's prolonged ICU course and history of COPD make him at risk for developing PE.
3. Infection: The patient's low albumin level, elevated INR, and tender abdomen make him at risk for developing sepsis and/or SBP.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis and low albumin level make him at risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Renal failure: The patient's elevated BUN/Cr ratio and possible prerenal state or gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) make him at risk for developing acute kidney injury.
6. Diarrhea: The patient's history of c.diff and ongoing diarrhea make him at risk for developing electrolyte imbalances and dehydration.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of COPD and possible cardiac shunt make him at risk for developing respiratory failure.
8. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of COPD and possible cardiac shunt make him at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient's history of ascites and possible SBP make him at risk for developing GIB.
10. Sepsis: The patient's low albumin level, elevated INR, and tender abdomen make him at risk for developing sepsis.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and blood pressure closely.
2. Consider further evaluation for PE, including a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest.
3. Continue to treat the patient's possible infection, including antibiotics and antifungals as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's liver function and albumin level closely.
5. Consider further evaluation for SBP, including diagnostic paracentesis.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and electrolyte levels closely.
7. Consider further evaluation for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), including upper endoscopy and colonoscopy.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider further evaluation for respiratory failure.
9. Consider further evaluation for cardiac arrhythmias, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust treatment plans as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male with history of cirrhosis and now with persistent and
   significant hypoxemia with concern for shunt physiology--both
   intrapulmonary and extrapulmonary with ECHO showing clear evidence of
   R->L flow during echo with increases in Right sided pressures.  He has
   had continued dynamic changes with left sided heart pressure which do
   argue strongly for significant intracardiac shunt as the dominant
   physiology here and hepato-pulmonary syndrome simply would not be as
   dynamic with small changes.  He may have porto-pulmonary hypertension
   driving some of the R->L shunt and progression here may explain the
   mainfestions now being more severe in the setting of chronic and
   previously insignificant PFO.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Hypoxemia
Diffuse causes have been postulated
   with shunt physiology clearly defined.
   -Right heart cath for
Shunt Run
 to evaluate intra-cardiac shunt as
   ongoing insults for correction
   -Will need CTA today for evaluate of possible PE and evaluation of the
   lower lobe infiltrate and possible infarct
   -Will add PEEP today to maintain patent airspaces
   -Continue ABX
   -Will need measurement of PA pressures
   -For COPD is on prednisone taper and weaning today with nebs continuing
   2)Hypotension-Likely consistent with sepsis and has possible pulmonary
   source given LLL infiltrate and hypothermia.  He has worsening of R->L
   shunt with decrease in systemic pressure so will wean today with
   careful attention to any changes in SaO2
   -Wean levophed today
   -Will follow up culture results
   -Will be interested to see CO as defined by swan ganz
   3)Cirrhosis-
   -Paracentesis today
   -Continue with lactulose/Rifaxamin
   -Appreciate hepatology input
   4)Thrombocytopenia-
   -Platelets replaced
   -[**Month (only) 8**] be splenic sequestration in the setting of cirrhosis
   -As time course of decline not clearly defined will have to follow up
   in HIT testing
   5)Renal Failure
   -Remains at cr-1.4

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male with history of cirrhosis and now with persistent and
   significant hypoxemia with concern for shunt physiology--both
   intrapulmonary and extrapulmonary with ECHO showing clear evidence of
   R->L flow during echo with increases in Right sided pressures.  He has
   had continued dynamic changes with left sided heart pressure which do
   argue strongly for significant intracardiac shunt as the dominant
   physiology here and hepato-pulmonary syndrome simply would not be as
   dynamic with small changes.  He may have porto-pulmonary hypertension
   driving some of the R->L shunt and progression here may explain the
   mainfestions now being more severe in the setting of chronic and
   previously insignificant PFO.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Hypoxemia
Diffuse causes have been postulated
   with shunt physiology clearly defined.
   -Right heart cath for
Shunt Run
 to evaluate intra-cardiac shunt as
   ongoing insults for correction
   -Will need CTA today for evaluate of possible PE and evaluation of the
   lower lobe infiltrate and possible infarct
   -Will add PEEP today to maintain patent airspaces
   -Continue ABX
   -Will need measurement of PA pressures
   -For COPD is on prednisone taper and weaning today with nebs continuing
   2)Hypotension-Likely consistent with sepsis and has possible pulmonary
   source given LLL infiltrate and hypothermia.  He has worsening of R->L
   shunt with decrease in systemic pressure so will wean today with
   careful attention to any changes in SaO2
   -Wean levophed today
   -Will follow up culture results
   -Will be interested to see CO as defined by swan ganz
   3)Cirrhosis-
   -Paracentesis today
   -Continue with lactulose/Rifaxamin
   -Appreciate hepatology input
   4)Thrombocytopenia-
   -Platelets replaced
   -[**Month (only) 8**] be splenic sequestration in the setting of cirrhosis
   -As time course of decline not clearly defined will have to follow up
   in HIT testing
   5)Renal Failure
   -Remains at cr-1.4

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure with shunt physiology, including intrapulmonary and extrapulmonary shunts. He has been admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's condition is complex, with multiple potential causes for his hypoxemia, including intracardiac shunt, porto-pulmonary hypertension, and possible pulmonary embolism.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure-Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is likely due to shunt physiology, which is a complex condition requiring further evaluation and management.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis, which is a potential complication of his cirrhosis and respiratory failure. His worsening R-L shunt with decrease in systemic pressure requires careful attention to changes in SaO2.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely due to cirrhosis, which can cause splenic sequestration. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the cause and course of his thrombocytopenia.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is likely due to his cirrhosis and hypotension. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the cause and course of his renal failure.
5. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis is a potential complication of his hypoxemic respiratory failure and requires ongoing management, including paracentesis and lactulose/Rifaxamin therapy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue respiratory support, including PEEP, to maintain patent airspaces.
2. Wean levophed today and follow up culture results.
3. Evaluate for possible pulmonary embolism with CTA today.
4. Continue ABX and monitor for signs of sepsis.
5. Wean prednisone taper and nebs today.
6. Monitor for changes in SaO2 and adjust therapy accordingly.
7. Continue lactulose/Rifaxamin therapy for cirrhosis.
8. Follow up with hepatology input for cirrhosis management.
9. Monitor for signs of renal failure and adjust therapy accordingly.
10. Consider HIT testing for thrombocytopenia."

   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD admitted to an OSH
   with SOB now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia
   1. Hypoxia: Multiple processes could be contributing: Cardiac shunt,
   PE, intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, and HPS.  Patient
s O2 sats now
   >90% by keeping MAPs > 70 with levophed and blood products.  MAP
   improves with platelets and FFP infusion.  Suggests that shunting may
   be playing a significant role.  To address these different possible
   etiologies:
    - Cardiac shunt
 evidence for this with PFO on TTE on [**3-28**]. Right
   heart catheterization showed R to L shunt, probable PFO and
   hepatopulmonary syndrome contributing
    - PE
 possible given patient
s prolonged OSH course.  Have deferred
   starting heparin given pending HIT Ab panel.  Prelim read on chest CT
   is no PE in central vessels, although limited study.
    - Intrinsic lung disease
 history of IPF from OSH notes, but does not
   appear so based on CXR.  Path from OSH biopsy now in [**State 5354**] and
   unobtainable for several days.  Does not appear to be significant IPF
   on chest CT.
    - Infection / PNA - has LLL infiltrate on CXR though cannot account
   for all of the patient
s hypoxia.
             - Cont. vanco/zosyn for HAP,
             - check induced sputum for PCP given [**Name9 (PRE) 4849**] steroid use.
             - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider
   adding caspo or vori if decompensates
    - HPS
 possible given underlying cirrhosis.  Will f/u hepatology recs
   as below.
   - Will plan on Nuc Med study to further quantify HPS
   - Plan to extubate after Nuc Med study
   2. Hypotension: Patient requiring levophed for blood pressure support
   and to help maintain O2 sats.  Underlying etiology unclear but may
   include sedation, shunt physiology, infection, and underlying liver
   disease.
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - w/u of other problems as above and below
   - [**Name (NI) **] improving intravascular volume
   3. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegaly and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.  Patient with tender abdomen.
   Diagnostic para: c/w portal HTN, no SBP
   - lactulose/rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs: no new recs
   - Add direct/indirect bilirubin to labs
   4. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppressions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.  Hct 42 on initial
   presentation to OSH and between 38 and 40 until [**3-18**].  Unclear why the
   precipitous drop recently.  Retic count elevated (6.6), iron low, B12 &
   folate sufficient. DDx includes DIC, TTP but not likely HIT as neg x2
   - iron supplementation
   - guaiac pos stools, only on prophylactic anticoagulation
   - F/u bilirubin breakdown and add peripheral smear
   5. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, infection, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   - CT head
   6. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. Will trend.
   7. Renal failure: Baseline from OSH is ~1.0, now improved to 1.1.
   Likely elevated BUN/Cr ratio which may represent prerenal state and
   GIB.
   - Follow and try to determine baseline status
   8. Diarrhea: Was being treated as c.diff though toxin negative at OSH
   and again here. [**Month (only) 8**] have also been due to lactulose.
   - C. diff neg x1, with one sample pending
   - Hold on PO vanco or flagyl unless decompensates or toxin returns
   positive
   9. COPD: Initially treated as primary diagnosis at time of admission to
   OSH. On steroid taper at OSH and appears to have received 50mg on day
   of transfer.
   - Continue taper
   - Albuterol/atrovent
   FEN: Cont TF, [**Month (only) **] and Plts as needed
   PPX: Pneumoboots; PPI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD admitted to an OSH
   with SOB now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia
   1. Hypoxia: Multiple processes could be contributing: Cardiac shunt,
   PE, intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, and HPS.  Patient
s O2 sats now
   >90% by keeping MAPs > 70 with levophed and blood products.  MAP
   improves with platelets and FFP infusion.  Suggests that shunting may
   be playing a significant role.  To address these different possible
   etiologies:
    - Cardiac shunt
 evidence for this with PFO on TTE on [**3-28**]. Right
   heart catheterization showed R to L shunt, probable PFO and
   hepatopulmonary syndrome contributing
    - PE
 possible given patient
s prolonged OSH course.  Have deferred
   starting heparin given pending HIT Ab panel.  Prelim read on chest CT
   is no PE in central vessels, although limited study.
    - Intrinsic lung disease
 history of IPF from OSH notes, but does not
   appear so based on CXR.  Path from OSH biopsy now in [**State 5354**] and
   unobtainable for several days.  Does not appear to be significant IPF
   on chest CT.
    - Infection / PNA - has LLL infiltrate on CXR though cannot account
   for all of the patient
s hypoxia.
             - Cont. vanco/zosyn for HAP,
             - check induced sputum for PCP given [**Name9 (PRE) 4849**] steroid use.
             - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider
   adding caspo or vori if decompensates
    - HPS
 possible given underlying cirrhosis.  Will f/u hepatology recs
   as below.
   - Will plan on Nuc Med study to further quantify HPS
   - Plan to extubate after Nuc Med study
   2. Hypotension: Patient requiring levophed for blood pressure support
   and to help maintain O2 sats.  Underlying etiology unclear but may
   include sedation, shunt physiology, infection, and underlying liver
   disease.
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - w/u of other problems as above and below
   - [**Name (NI) **] improving intravascular volume
   3. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegaly and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.  Patient with tender abdomen.
   Diagnostic para: c/w portal HTN, no SBP
   - lactulose/rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs: no new recs
   - Add direct/indirect bilirubin to labs
   4. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppressions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.  Hct 42 on initial
   presentation to OSH and between 38 and 40 until [**3-18**].  Unclear why the
   precipitous drop recently.  Retic count elevated (6.6), iron low, B12 &
   folate sufficient. DDx includes DIC, TTP but not likely HIT as neg x2
   - iron supplementation
   - guaiac pos stools, only on prophylactic anticoagulation
   - F/u bilirubin breakdown and add peripheral smear
   5. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, infection, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   - CT head
   6. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. Will trend.
   7. Renal failure: Baseline from OSH is ~1.0, now improved to 1.1.
   Likely elevated BUN/Cr ratio which may represent prerenal state and
   GIB.
   - Follow and try to determine baseline status
   8. Diarrhea: Was being treated as c.diff though toxin negative at OSH
   and again here. [**Month (only) 8**] have also been due to lactulose.
   - C. diff neg x1, with one sample pending
   - Hold on PO vanco or flagyl unless decompensates or toxin returns
   positive
   9. COPD: Initially treated as primary diagnosis at time of admission to
   OSH. On steroid taper at OSH and appears to have received 50mg on day
   of transfer.
   - Continue taper
   - Albuterol/atrovent
   FEN: Cont TF, [**Month (only) **] and Plts as needed
   PPX: Pneumoboots; PPI

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD, and a history of IPF. He is currently in the ICU due to hypoxia, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient's condition is complex and multifactorial, with several potential medical complications that can arise.

The patient has a right-to-left shunt, which is contributing to his hypoxia. He also has a possible pulmonary embolism (PE), intrinsic lung disease, and infection/pneumonia, which are all potential causes of his hypoxia. The patient's liver function is impaired, which is contributing to his hypotension, anemia, and altered mental status.

The patient's anemia is likely multifactorial, with possible causes including marrow suppression from ethanol, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and possible deficiencies. His reticulocyte count is elevated, and his iron levels are low, which suggests that his anemia may be due to a combination of factors.

The patient has a history of IPF, which is a chronic lung disease that can lead to fibrosis and scarring of the lungs. He also has a history of COPD, which is a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that can cause breathing difficulties.

The patient's condition is being managed with a combination of medications, including vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for infection, lactulose and rifaximin for cirrhosis, and iron supplementation for anemia. He is also receiving oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation to help improve his oxygenation.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and possible PE make him at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's right-to-left shunt and possible PE make him at risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
3. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and history of IPF make him at risk for infection, particularly with opportunistic pathogens such as Pneumocystis jirovecii.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's cirrhosis and possible GIB make him at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Renal failure: The patient's impaired liver function and possible GIB make him at risk for renal failure.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, which can lead to further complications such as cardiovascular disease and increased risk of infection.
7. Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and possible encephalopathy make him at risk for further neurological complications.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical condition. The patient has a history of cirrhosis of the liver, likely due to alcoholism, and is currently in the ICU with severe bleeding, anemia, and hypotension. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions and has been treated with vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure and is being ventilated.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 35.4°C (95.8°F)
* Heart rate: 58 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 153/61 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 8 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Hemoglobin: 6.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 9 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 17.5 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Total bilirubin: 6.3 mg/dL
* Albumin: 2.3 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.0 mmol/L

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Bleeding complications: The patient's bleeding is ongoing, and there is a risk of further bleeding complications, including hemorrhagic shock.
* Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing infections, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression and the use of central lines and other invasive devices.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and there is a risk of further deterioration, including respiratory arrest.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's hypotension and hypoxemia may lead to cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and there is a risk of further deterioration, including renal failure.
* Liver failure: The patient's cirrhosis of the liver is likely to worsen, and there is a risk of liver failure.
* Neurological complications: The patient's anemia and hypoxemia may lead to neurological complications, including seizures, coma, and brain death."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-inch tall individual with a weight not specified, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of anemia, hypotension, and hypoxemia. The patient has a history of cirrhosis of the liver, likely due to alcohol use.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.4°C (95.8°F), heart rate of 58 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 153/61 mmHg. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100%.

The patient has received blood products, including 3 units of packed red blood cells and 2 units of platelets, due to acute hemolysis and thrombocytopenia. The patient's hemoglobin level is 6.5 g/dL, and platelet count is 9 K/uL.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), as well as elevated bilirubin levels. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR).

The patient's physical examination reveals ecchymoses on the upper extremities and chest, as well as questionable ascites and hepatosplenomegaly. The patient's skin is warm and well-perfused, with 1+ pulses, but has no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy increase the risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and bleeding into the lungs.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of developing infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI).
3. Liver failure: The patient's cirrhosis and elevated liver enzymes increase the risk of liver failure, which can lead to coagulopathy, bleeding, and decreased synthetic function.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis increase the risk of respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by the patient's underlying lung disease and the use of mechanical ventilation.
5. Renal failure: The patient's hypotension and hypovolemia increase the risk of renal failure, which can be exacerbated by the patient's underlying liver disease and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia increase the risk of cardiac complications, including cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their bleeding, infection, and organ dysfunction to prevent further complications and improve their overall outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD admitted to an OSH
   with SOB now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia
   1. Hypoxia: Multiple processes could be contributing: Cardiac shunt,
   PE, intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, and HPS.  Patient
s O2 sats now
   >90% by keeping MAPs > 70 with levophed and blood products.  MAP
   improves with platelets and FFP infusion.  Suggests that shunting may
   be playing a significant role.  To address these different possible
   etiologies:
    - Cardiac shunt
 evidence for this with PFO on TTE on [**3-28**]. Right
   heart catheterization
    - PE
 possible given patient
s prolonged OSH course.  Have deferred
   starting heparin given pending HIT Ab panel.  Prelim read on chest CT
   is no PE in central vessels, although limited study.
    - Intrinsic lung disease
 history of IPF from OSH notes, but does not
   appear so based on CXR.  Path from OSH biopsy now in [**State 5354**] and
   unobtainable for several days.  Does not appear to be significant IPF
   on chest CT.
    - Infection / PNA - has LLL infiltrate on CXR though cannot account
   for all of the patient
s hypoxia.
             - Cont. vanco/zosyn for HAP,
             - check induced sputum for PCP given [**Name9 (PRE) 4849**] steroid use.
             - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider
   adding caspo or vori
    - HPS
 possible given underlying cirrhosis.  Will f/u hepatology recs
   as below.
   2. Hypotension: Patient requiring levophed for blood pressure support
   and to help maintain O2 sats.  Underlying etiology unclear but may
   include sedation, shunt physiology, infection, and underlying liver
   disease.
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - w/u of other problems as above and below
   - [**Name (NI) **] improving intravascular volume
   3. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegaly and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.  Patient with tender abdomen.
   Diagnostic para: c/w portal HTN, no SBP
   - lactulose/rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs: no new recs
   4. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppressions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.  Hct 42 on initial
   presentation to OSH and between 38 and 40 until [**3-18**].  Unclear why the
   precipitous drop recently.  Retic count elevated (6.6), iron low, B12 &
   folate sufficient.
   - iron supplementation
   - guaiac pos stools, only on prophylactic anticoagulation
   5. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, infection, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   - CT head
   6. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. Will trend.
   7. Renal failure: Baseline from OSH is ~1.0, now improved to 1.1.
   Likely elevated BUN/Cr ratio which may represent prerenal state and
   GIB.
   - Follow and try to determine baseline status
   8. Diarrhea: Was being treated as c.diff though toxin negative at OSH
   and again here. [**Month (only) 8**] have also been due to lactulose.
   - C. diff neg x1, with one sample pending
   - Hold on PO vanco or flagyl unless decompensates or toxin returns
   positive
   9. COPD: Initially treated as primary diagnosis at time of admission to
   OSH. On steroid taper at OSH and appears to have received 50mg on day
   of transfer.
   - Continue taper
   - Albuterol/atrovent
   FEN: NGT today & start tube feeds with nutrition consult, [**Month (only) **] and
   Plts as needed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD admitted to an OSH
   with SOB now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia
   1. Hypoxia: Multiple processes could be contributing: Cardiac shunt,
   PE, intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, and HPS.  Patient
s O2 sats now
   >90% by keeping MAPs > 70 with levophed and blood products.  MAP
   improves with platelets and FFP infusion.  Suggests that shunting may
   be playing a significant role.  To address these different possible
   etiologies:
    - Cardiac shunt
 evidence for this with PFO on TTE on [**3-28**]. Right
   heart catheterization
    - PE
 possible given patient
s prolonged OSH course.  Have deferred
   starting heparin given pending HIT Ab panel.  Prelim read on chest CT
   is no PE in central vessels, although limited study.
    - Intrinsic lung disease
 history of IPF from OSH notes, but does not
   appear so based on CXR.  Path from OSH biopsy now in [**State 5354**] and
   unobtainable for several days.  Does not appear to be significant IPF
   on chest CT.
    - Infection / PNA - has LLL infiltrate on CXR though cannot account
   for all of the patient
s hypoxia.
             - Cont. vanco/zosyn for HAP,
             - check induced sputum for PCP given [**Name9 (PRE) 4849**] steroid use.
             - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider
   adding caspo or vori
    - HPS
 possible given underlying cirrhosis.  Will f/u hepatology recs
   as below.
   2. Hypotension: Patient requiring levophed for blood pressure support
   and to help maintain O2 sats.  Underlying etiology unclear but may
   include sedation, shunt physiology, infection, and underlying liver
   disease.
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - w/u of other problems as above and below
   - [**Name (NI) **] improving intravascular volume
   3. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegaly and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.  Patient with tender abdomen.
   Diagnostic para: c/w portal HTN, no SBP
   - lactulose/rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs: no new recs
   4. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppressions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.  Hct 42 on initial
   presentation to OSH and between 38 and 40 until [**3-18**].  Unclear why the
   precipitous drop recently.  Retic count elevated (6.6), iron low, B12 &
   folate sufficient.
   - iron supplementation
   - guaiac pos stools, only on prophylactic anticoagulation
   5. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, infection, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   - CT head
   6. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. Will trend.
   7. Renal failure: Baseline from OSH is ~1.0, now improved to 1.1.
   Likely elevated BUN/Cr ratio which may represent prerenal state and
   GIB.
   - Follow and try to determine baseline status
   8. Diarrhea: Was being treated as c.diff though toxin negative at OSH
   and again here. [**Month (only) 8**] have also been due to lactulose.
   - C. diff neg x1, with one sample pending
   - Hold on PO vanco or flagyl unless decompensates or toxin returns
   positive
   9. COPD: Initially treated as primary diagnosis at time of admission to
   OSH. On steroid taper at OSH and appears to have received 50mg on day
   of transfer.
   - Continue taper
   - Albuterol/atrovent
   FEN: NGT today & start tube feeds with nutrition consult, [**Month (only) **] and
   Plts as needed

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a prolonged hospital course. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation of hypoxia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: Intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 121 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving norepinephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 70 mmHg.
* Laboratory results: The patient has a platelet count of 9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 6.5 g/dL, white blood cell (WBC) count of 17.5 K/uL, and a lactate level of 2.0 mmol/L.
* Other findings: The patient has a questionable ascites, splenomegaly, and ecchymoses throughout the upper extremities and chest.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be due to cardiac shunt, pulmonary embolism (PE), intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, or hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sedation, shunt physiology, infection, or underlying liver disease. Weaning of pressors as tolerated and further evaluation of other potential causes are necessary.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis may lead to complications such as portal hypertension, ascites, and encephalopathy. Further evaluation and management are necessary to address these potential complications.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be due to marrow suppression, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), or deficiencies. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the underlying cause.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, hypoxia, infection, or other factors. Further evaluation and management are necessary to address these potential causes.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may be due to various factors, including liver disease, kidney disease, or excessive fluid intake. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the underlying cause.
7. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may be due to prerenal state, GIB, or other factors. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the underlying cause.
8. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may be due to various factors, including infection, medication, or underlying gastrointestinal disease. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the underlying cause.
9. COPD: The patient's COPD may lead to complications such as respiratory failure, pneumonia, or other respiratory problems. Further evaluation and management are necessary to address these potential complications.

In summary, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, including hypoxia, hypotension, cirrhosis, anemia, altered mental status, hyponatremia, renal failure, diarrhea, and COPD. Further evaluation and management are necessary to address these potential complications and improve the patient's outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male with cirrhosis now admit with hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of what appears to be left sided pneumonia, no evidence
   of PE, PFO but no active R->L shunt at catheterization yesterday and
   concern for persistent hepatopulmonary syndrome but with limited
   capacity to evaluate further.  What we are left with is a significant
   persistent oxygen requirement and this is driven by intrapulmonary
   shunt in large part with
pneumonia, atelectasis and some component of
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome.  The pneumonia and atelectasis may well be
   dynamic and will work to optimize status as we move to try extubation.
   1)Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure-  Secondary to above
   -Will perform bronch today to clear area of collapse and infection as
   best as possible to allow minimization of shunt fraction
   -Zosyn/Vanco to continue
   -Will maintain PSV support now and keep PEEP=[**5-11**]
   -Will pursue intra-pulmonary shunt study with nuclear scan to attempt
   to quantify extent of intrapulmonary shunt
   -Would hope to move to extubation today if at all possible as primary
   requirement is oxygen support and FIO2 can be adjusted with high flow
   once testing has been safely concluded.
   2) ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)-
   -Will look to hemolysis
   -no source of bleed clearly seen
   -Did have paracentesis yesterday and there is concern for IP bleeding
   but not suggested on CT scan this am which did not show RP bleeding
   3)Cirrhosis-
   -Lactulose/Rifax for MS
   [**Name13 (STitle) 5378**] up OB pos stools
   -Ascites without evidence of infection

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with cirrhosis who was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure, secondary to left-sided pneumonia, atelectasis, and possible hepato-pulmonary syndrome. The patient has undergone various diagnostic tests, including paracentesis, cardiac catheterization, and CT scans of the chest and head.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 850 mL, and oxygen support is required to maintain an SpO2 of 92%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a normal sinus rhythm, and his blood pressure is 119/51 mmHg.
* Hematological: The patient has acute anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 6.8 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 28 K/uL.
* Renal: The patient has mild renal impairment, with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL.
* Liver: The patient has cirrhosis, with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels.
* Infectious: The patient has left-sided pneumonia, and there is concern for persistent hepatopulmonary syndrome.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the persistence of intrapulmonary shunt, pneumonia, and atelectasis.
2. Anemia: The patient's acute anemia may worsen due to ongoing blood loss or inadequate transfusion support.
3. Infection: The patient's left-sided pneumonia may progress and spread to other parts of the lung, leading to sepsis and organ failure.
4. Hepato-pulmonary syndrome: The patient's possible hepato-pulmonary syndrome may worsen, leading to further oxygen requirements and potential organ failure.
5. Liver failure: The patient's cirrhosis may progress, leading to liver failure and potential multi-organ failure.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Bronchoscopy to clear the area of collapse and infection.
2. Continuation of antibiotics and antifungal therapy.
3. Maintenance of PSV support and PEEP.
4. Pursuit of an intra-pulmonary shunt study with nuclear scan to quantify the extent of intrapulmonary shunt.
5. Optimization of glycemic control and nutrition.
6. Management of ascites and potential bleeding.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, including respiratory failure, anemia, infection, and liver failure. Close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications and improve the patient's outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD admitted to an OSH
   with SOB now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia
   1. Hypoxia: Multiple processes could be contributing: Cardiac shunt,
   PE, intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, and HPS.  Patient
s O2 sats now
   >90% by keeping MAPs > 70 with levophed and blood products.  MAP
   improves with platelets and FFP infusion.  Suggests that shunting may
   be playing a significant role.  To address these different possible
   etiologies:
    - Cardiac shunt
 evidence for this with PFO on TTE on [**3-28**]. Right
   heart catheterization showed R to L shunt, probable PFO and
   hepatopulmonary syndrome contributing
    - PE
 possible given patient
s prolonged OSH course.  Have deferred
   starting heparin given pending HIT Ab panel.  Prelim read on chest CT
   is no PE in central vessels, although limited study.
    - Intrinsic lung disease
 history of IPF from OSH notes, but does not
   appear so based on CXR.  Path from OSH biopsy now in [**State 5354**] and
   unobtainable for several days.  Does not appear to be significant IPF
   on chest CT.
    - Infection / PNA - has LLL infiltrate on CXR though cannot account
   for all of the patient
s hypoxia.
             - Cont. vanco/zosyn for HAP,
             - check induced sputum for PCP given [**Name9 (PRE) 4849**] steroid use.
             - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider
   adding caspo or vori if decompensates
    - HPS
 possible given underlying cirrhosis.  Will f/u hepatology recs
   as below.
   - Will plan on Nuc Med study to further quantify HPS
   - Plan to extubate after Nuc Med study
   2. Hypotension: Patient requiring levophed for blood pressure support
   and to help maintain O2 sats.  Underlying etiology unclear but may
   include sedation, shunt physiology, infection, and underlying liver
   disease.
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - w/u of other problems as above and below
   - [**Name (NI) **] improving intravascular volume
   3. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegaly and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.  Patient with tender abdomen.
   Diagnostic para: c/w portal HTN, no SBP
   - lactulose/rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs: no new recs
   - Add direct/indirect bilirubin to labs
   4. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppressions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.  Hct 42 on initial
   presentation to OSH and between 38 and 40 until [**3-18**].  Unclear why the
   precipitous drop recently.  Retic count elevated (6.6), iron low, B12 &
   folate sufficient. DDx includes DIC, TTP but not likely HIT as neg x2
   - iron supplementation
   - guaiac pos stools, only on prophylactic anticoagulation
   - F/u bilirubin breakdown and add peripheral smear
   5. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, infection, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   - CT head
   6. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. Will trend.
   7. Renal failure: Baseline from OSH is ~1.0, now improved to 1.1.
   Likely elevated BUN/Cr ratio which may represent prerenal state and
   GIB.
   - Follow and try to determine baseline status
   8. Diarrhea: Was being treated as c.diff though toxin negative at OSH
   and again here. [**Month (only) 8**] have also been due to lactulose.
   - C. diff neg x1, with one sample pending
   - Hold on PO vanco or flagyl unless decompensates or toxin returns
   positive
   9. COPD: Initially treated as primary diagnosis at time of admission to
   OSH. On steroid taper at OSH and appears to have received 50mg on day
   of transfer.
   - Continue taper
   - Albuterol/atrovent
   FEN: Cont TF, [**Month (only) **] and Plts as needed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Cards recs: If symptomatic after extubated and off pressors, will
   consider repeat right heart cath
   - Heme consulted for thrombocytopenia - likely drug reaction - D/c
   possible offending antibiotics, check HIV, transfuse to > 10
   - Nuc Med study showed R to L shunt, likely performed while PFO not
   playing a large role, so adds additional evidence for large
   intrapulmonary shunt
   - Plts dropped - received 8 units plts in 24 hrs
   - D/c'd vancomycin - concern for drug-induced thrombocytopenia

   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD admitted to an OSH
   with SOB now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia
   1. Hypoxia: Multiple processes could be contributing: Cardiac shunt,
   PE, intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, and HPS.  Patient
s O2 sats now
   >90% by keeping MAPs > 70 with levophed and blood products.  MAP
   improves with platelets and FFP infusion.  Suggests that shunting may
   be playing a significant role.  To address these different possible
   etiologies:
    - Cardiac shunt
 evidence for this with PFO on TTE on [**3-28**]. Right
   heart catheterization showed R to L shunt, probable PFO and
   hepatopulmonary syndrome contributing
    - PE
 possible given patient
s prolonged OSH course.  Have deferred
   starting heparin given pending HIT Ab panel.  Prelim read on chest CT
   is no PE in central vessels, although limited study.
    - Intrinsic lung disease
 history of IPF from OSH notes, but does not
   appear so based on CXR.  Path from OSH biopsy now in [**State 5354**] and
   unobtainable for several days.  Does not appear to be significant IPF
   on chest CT.
    - Infection / PNA - has LLL infiltrate on CXR though cannot account
   for all of the patient
s hypoxia.
             - Cont. vanco/zosyn for HAP,
             - check induced sputum for PCP given [**Name9 (PRE) 4849**] steroid use.
             - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider
   adding caspo or vori if decompensates
    - HPS
 possible given underlying cirrhosis.  Will f/u hepatology recs
   as below.
   - Will plan on Nuc Med study to further quantify HPS
   - Plan to extubate after Nuc Med study
   2. Hypotension: Patient requiring levophed for blood pressure support
   and to help maintain O2 sats.  Underlying etiology unclear but may
   include sedation, shunt physiology, infection, and underlying liver
   disease.
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - w/u of other problems as above and below
   - [**Name (NI) **] improving intravascular volume
   3. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegaly and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.  Patient with tender abdomen.
   Diagnostic para: c/w portal HTN, no SBP
   - lactulose/rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs: no new recs
   - Add direct/indirect bilirubin to labs
   4. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppressions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.  Hct 42 on initial
   presentation to OSH and between 38 and 40 until [**3-18**].  Unclear why the
   precipitous drop recently.  Retic count elevated (6.6), iron low, B12 &
   folate sufficient. DDx includes DIC, TTP but not likely HIT as neg x2
   - iron supplementation
   - guaiac pos stools, only on prophylactic anticoagulation
   - F/u bilirubin breakdown and add peripheral smear
   5. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, infection, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   - CT head
   6. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. Will trend.
   7. Renal failure: Baseline from OSH is ~1.0, now improved to 1.1.
   Likely elevated BUN/Cr ratio which may represent prerenal state and
   GIB.
   - Follow and try to determine baseline status
   8. Diarrhea: Was being treated as c.diff though toxin negative at OSH
   and again here. [**Month (only) 8**] have also been due to lactulose.
   - C. diff neg x1, with one sample pending
   - Hold on PO vanco or flagyl unless decompensates or toxin returns
   positive
   9. COPD: Initially treated as primary diagnosis at time of admission to
   OSH. On steroid taper at OSH and appears to have received 50mg on day
   of transfer.
   - Continue taper
   - Albuterol/atrovent

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD, and hypoxia. He was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of hypoxia, likely due to multiple factors including cardiac shunt, pulmonary embolism, intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, and hepatopulmonary syndrome. The patient's oxygen saturation is currently >90% with MAPs >70, suggesting that shunting may be playing a significant role.

The patient's condition is complex, and multiple potential medical complications can arise. Some of the potential complications include:

1. Cardiac shunt: The patient has a right-to-left shunt, which may lead to further hypoxia and potential cardiac complications.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's prolonged OSH course and history of IPF make pulmonary embolism a possible diagnosis.
3. Intrinsic lung disease: The patient's history of IPF and the presence of a lung infiltrate on CXR suggest that intrinsic lung disease may be contributing to his hypoxia.
4. Infection/Pneumonia: The patient has a lung infiltrate on CXR and may have pneumonia, which could exacerbate his hypoxia.
5. Hepatopulmonary syndrome: The patient's underlying cirrhosis and the presence of a right-to-left shunt suggest that hepatopulmonary syndrome may be contributing to his hypoxia.
6. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine is elevated, and he may have prerenal acute kidney injury due to GIB.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely multifactorial, including marrow suppression due to EtOH, GIB, and possible deficiencies.
8. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, hypoxia, infection, or other factors.
9. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia has improved, but it is unclear whether it is due to underlying liver disease or other factors.
10. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may be due to C. difficile or lactulose, and it is unclear whether it is a complication of his underlying liver disease or other factors.
11. COPD: The patient's COPD is being treated with steroids and bronchodilators, but it is unclear whether it is contributing to his hypoxia.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for:

1. Cardiac arrest due to cardiac shunt and hypoxia
2. Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis
3. Infection and sepsis due to underlying liver disease and potential pneumonia
4. Renal failure and acute kidney injury due to GIB and prerenal factors
5. Anemia and bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and possible deficiencies
6. Altered mental status and encephalopathy due to hyponatremia, liver disease, and hypoxia
7. Diarrhea and electrolyte imbalances due to C. difficile and lactulose
8. COPD exacerbation and respiratory failure due to bronchodilator taper and underlying lung disease."

   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD admitted to an OSH
   with SOB now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia
   1. Hypoxia: Initially felt that multiple processes could be
   contributing: Cardiac shunt, PE, intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, and
   HPS.  Initially got O2 sats >90% by keeping MAPs > 70 with levophed and
   blood products.  MAP improves with platelets and FFP infusion.
   Suggests that shunting may be playing a significant role.  Hypoxia Most
   likely HPS with some cardiac shunting and L-sided PNA.  To address
   these different possible etiologies:
    - Cardiac shunt
 evidence for this with PFO on TTE on [**3-28**]. Right
   heart catheterization showed R to L shunt, probable PFO and
   hepatopulmonary syndrome contributing
   - HPS
 likely given underlying cirrhosis and suggested by shunt
   study.  Will f/u hepatology recs as below.  Consider starting
   pentyoxyphylline.
    - PE
 possible given patient
s prolonged OSH course.  Have deferred
   starting heparin given pending HIT Ab panel.  Prelim read on chest CT
   is no PE in central vessels, although limited study.
    - Intrinsic lung disease
 history of IPF from OSH notes, but does not
   appear so based on CXR.  Path from OSH biopsy now in [**State 5354**] and
   unobtainable for several days.  Does not appear to be significant IPF
   on chest CT.
    - Infection / PNA - has LLL infiltrate on CXR though cannot account
   for all of the patient
s hypoxia.
             - Cont. vanco/zosyn for HAP,
             - check induced sputum for PCP given [**Name9 (PRE) 4849**] steroid use.
             - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider
   adding caspo or vori if decompensates
   - Patient still on FIO2 80% and not waking up this morning.  O2 sats
   still upper 80s to low 90s, not yet ready for extubation.
   2. Hypotension: Resolving.  Patient initially required levophed for
   blood pressure support and to help maintain O2 sats.  Underlying
   etiology unclear but may include sedation, shunt physiology, infection,
   and underlying liver disease.  Levophed now weaned off.
   - w/u of other problems as above and below
   - [**Name (NI) **] improving intravascular volume
   3. Thrombocytopenia: Unable to increase platelets despite 8 units in 24
   hours (5 since 8 pm last night).  HIT Ab neg here and at OSH.  Smear
   unremarkable.  DIC labs negative.  Patient is already on steroids if
   ITP is contributing.  Hematology is following, their assistance is
   appreciated.
   - Vancomycin was stopped [**3-30**].  Will stop zosyn [**3-31**] as possible
   medication effect could be contributing.
   - change PPI to Ranitidine
   - f/u heme recs
   4. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegaly and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.  Patient with tender abdomen.
   Diagnostic para: c/w portal HTN, no SBP
   - lactulose/rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs: no new recs
   - Add direct/indirect bilirubin to labs
   5. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppressions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.  Hct 42 on initial
   presentation to OSH and between 38 and 40 until [**3-18**].  Unclear why the
   precipitous drop recently.  Retic count elevated (6.6), iron low, B12 &
   folate sufficient. DIC labs negative.  HIT as neg x2.   Peripheral
   smear not suggestive.
   - iron supplementation
   - guaiac pos stools, only on prophylactic anticoagulation
   - F/u bilirubin breakdown
   6. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, infection, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   - CT head
   7. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. Will trend.
   8. Renal failure: Baseline from OSH is ~1.0, now improved to 1.1.
   Likely elevated BUN/Cr ratio which may represent prerenal state and
   GIB.
   - Follow and try to determine baseline status
   9. Diarrhea: Was being treated as c.diff though toxin negative at OSH
   and again here x2. [**Month (only) 8**] have also been due to lactulose.
   - Hold on PO vanco or flagyl unless decompensates then resend for C.
   diff.
   10. COPD: Initially treated as primary diagnosis at time of admission
   to OSH. On steroid taper at OSH and appears to have received 50mg on
   day of transfer.
   - Continue taper
   - Albuterol/atrovent
   FEN: Cont TF, [**Month (only) **] and Plts as needed
   PPX: Pneumoboots; Ranitidine

   Shunt study: There is somewhat heterogenous pulmonary perfusion but
   without segmental or large subsegmental defects. There is tracer
   activity in the liver, spleen, kidneys, brain and thyroid gland, which
   is abnormal and indicates the presence of a right-to-left shunt.

   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD admitted to an OSH
   with SOB now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia
   1. Hypoxia: Initially felt that multiple processes could be
   contributing: Cardiac shunt, PE, intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, and
   HPS.  Initially got O2 sats >90% by keeping MAPs > 70 with levophed and
   blood products.  MAP improves with platelets and FFP infusion.
   Suggests that shunting may be playing a significant role.  Hypoxia Most
   likely HPS with some cardiac shunting and L-sided PNA.  To address
   these different possible etiologies:
    - Cardiac shunt
 evidence for this with PFO on TTE on [**3-28**]. Right
   heart catheterization showed R to L shunt, probable PFO and
   hepatopulmonary syndrome contributing
   - HPS
 likely given underlying cirrhosis and suggested by shunt
   study.  Will f/u hepatology recs as below.  Consider starting
   pentyoxyphylline.
    - PE
 possible given patient
s prolonged OSH course.  Have deferred
   starting heparin given pending HIT Ab panel.  Prelim read on chest CT
   is no PE in central vessels, although limited study.
    - Intrinsic lung disease
 history of IPF from OSH notes, but does not
   appear so based on CXR.  Path from OSH biopsy now in [**State 5354**] and
   unobtainable for several days.  Does not appear to be significant IPF
   on chest CT.
    - Infection / PNA - has LLL infiltrate on CXR though cannot account
   for all of the patient
s hypoxia.
             - Cont. vanco/zosyn for HAP,
             - check induced sputum for PCP given [**Name9 (PRE) 4849**] steroid use.
             - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider
   adding caspo or vori if decompensates
   - Patient still on FIO2 80% and not waking up this morning.  O2 sats
   still upper 80s to low 90s, not yet ready for extubation.
   2. Hypotension: Resolving.  Patient initially required levophed for
   blood pressure support and to help maintain O2 sats.  Underlying
   etiology unclear but may include sedation, shunt physiology, infection,
   and underlying liver disease.  Levophed now weaned off.
   - w/u of other problems as above and below
   - [**Name (NI) **] improving intravascular volume
   3. Thrombocytopenia: Unable to increase platelets despite 8 units in 24
   hours (5 since 8 pm last night).  HIT Ab neg here and at OSH.  Smear
   unremarkable.  DIC labs negative.  Patient is already on steroids if
   ITP is contributing.  Hematology is following, their assistance is
   appreciated.
   - Vancomycin was stopped [**3-30**].  Will stop zosyn [**3-31**] as possible
   medication effect could be contributing.
   - change PPI to Ranitidine
   - f/u heme recs
   4. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegaly and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.  Patient with tender abdomen.
   Diagnostic para: c/w portal HTN, no SBP
   - lactulose/rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs: no new recs
   - Add direct/indirect bilirubin to labs
   5. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppressions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.  Hct 42 on initial
   presentation to OSH and between 38 and 40 until [**3-18**].  Unclear why the
   precipitous drop recently.  Retic count elevated (6.6), iron low, B12 &
   folate sufficient. DIC labs negative.  HIT as neg x2.   Peripheral
   smear not suggestive.
   - iron supplementation
   - guaiac pos stools, only on prophylactic anticoagulation
   - F/u bilirubin breakdown
   6. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, infection, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   - CT head
   7. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. Will trend.
   8. Renal failure: Baseline from OSH is ~1.0, now improved to 1.1.
   Likely elevated BUN/Cr ratio which may represent prerenal state and
   GIB.
   - Follow and try to determine baseline status
   9. Diarrhea: Was being treated as c.diff though toxin negative at OSH
   and again here x2. [**Month (only) 8**] have also been due to lactulose.
   - Hold on PO vanco or flagyl unless decompensates then resend for C.
   diff.
   10. COPD: Initially treated as primary diagnosis at time of admission
   to OSH. On steroid taper at OSH and appears to have received 50mg on
   day of transfer.
   - Continue taper
   - Albuterol/atrovent
   FEN: Cont TF, [**Month (only) **] and Plts as needed

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD, and hypoxia. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with symptoms of shortness of breath (SOB) and was transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia.

The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple potential etiologies for his hypoxia, including:

1. Cardiac shunt: The patient has a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and a right-to-left shunt, which may be contributing to his hypoxia.
2. Hypoxia due to hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS): The patient has cirrhosis and a shunt study showed abnormal pulmonary perfusion, which is consistent with HPS.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a prolonged OSH course, which may have increased his risk of PE.
4. Intrinsic lung disease: The patient has a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), but this does not appear to be the primary cause of his hypoxia.
5. Infection/Pneumonia: The patient has a left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, which may be contributing to his hypoxia.

The patient is also experiencing other medical complications, including:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a platelet count of 15, which is likely due to a combination of factors, including cirrhosis, infection, and medication.
2. Cirrhosis: The patient has portal hypertension and splenomegaly, which may be contributing to his thrombocytopenia.
3. Anemia: The patient has a hemoglobin level of 7.9, which is likely due to a combination of factors, including cirrhosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and medication.
4. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing confusion and disorientation, which may be due to a combination of factors, including hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, hypoxia, and infection.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has a sodium level of 129, which is likely due to a combination of factors, including cirrhosis, medication, and infection.
6. Renal failure: The patient has a creatinine level of 1.1, which may be due to a combination of factors, including cirrhosis, dehydration, and medication.

The patient is receiving treatment for his various medical conditions, including antibiotics for possible pneumonia, anticoagulation for possible PE, and medications for his cirrhosis and portal hypertension. He is also receiving nutrition support and has a plan for glycemic control.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac shunt may worsen, leading to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
3. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system may increase his risk of infection.
4. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase his risk of bleeding.
5. Renal failure: The patient's kidney function may worsen, leading to renal failure.
6. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver function may worsen, leading to hepatic encephalopathy.
7. Sepsis: The patient's compromised immune system may increase his risk of sepsis.

Overall, the patient's medical condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male with cirrhosis now admit with hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of what appears to be left sided pneumonia, no evidence
   of PE, PFO but no active R->L shunt at catheterization yesterday and
   concern for persistent hepatopulmonary syndrome but with limited
   capacity to evaluate further.  What we are left with is a significant
   persistent oxygen requirement and this is driven by intrapulmonary
   shunt in large part with pneumonia, atelectasis and some component of
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome.  The pneumonia and atelectasis may well be
   dynamic and will work to optimize status as we move to try extubation.
   1)Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure-  Secondary to above
   - sats decreased to 86% on PS 0/5 on 80% FiO2.
   - Zosyn to continue, off vanc due to thrombocytopenia
   - Will maintain PSV support now and keep sats>89%
   - new pulm infiltrates may be CHF with platelet transfusion, new
   infection, hemorrhage
    2) Acute blood loss anemia
   - No evidence of hemolysis, checking repeat smear
   - no source of bleed clearly seen
   - Did have paracentesis yesterday and there is concern for IP bleeding
   but not suggested on CT scan this am which did not show RP bleeding
   3) Acute thrombocytopenia
   - refractory to transfusions, ? ITP vs HIT unlikely vs leukemia
   - will ask hematology to reassess
   - on steroids for COPD but may require higher doses
   - will d/c Zosyn as possible culprit
   - switch PPI to H2 blocker
   4) Cirrhosis-
   -Lactulose/Rifax for MS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male with cirrhosis now admit with hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of what appears to be left sided pneumonia, no evidence
   of PE, PFO but no active R->L shunt at catheterization yesterday and
   concern for persistent hepatopulmonary syndrome but with limited
   capacity to evaluate further.  What we are left with is a significant
   persistent oxygen requirement and this is driven by intrapulmonary
   shunt in large part with pneumonia, atelectasis and some component of
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome.  The pneumonia and atelectasis may well be
   dynamic and will work to optimize status as we move to try extubation.
   1)Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure-  Secondary to above
   - sats decreased to 86% on PS 0/5 on 80% FiO2.
   - Zosyn to continue, off vanc due to thrombocytopenia
   - Will maintain PSV support now and keep sats>89%
   - new pulm infiltrates may be CHF with platelet transfusion, new
   infection, hemorrhage
    2) Acute blood loss anemia
   - No evidence of hemolysis, checking repeat smear
   - no source of bleed clearly seen
   - Did have paracentesis yesterday and there is concern for IP bleeding
   but not suggested on CT scan this am which did not show RP bleeding
   3) Acute thrombocytopenia
   - refractory to transfusions, ? ITP vs HIT unlikely vs leukemia
   - will ask hematology to reassess
   - on steroids for COPD but may require higher doses
   - will d/c Zosyn as possible culprit
   - switch PPI to H2 blocker
   4) Cirrhosis-
   -Lactulose/Rifax for MS
   [**Name13 (STitle) 5378**] up OB pos stools
   - Ascites without evidence of infection

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with cirrhosis, COPD, and EtOH dependence, admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complex, and several potential medical complications are present.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a significant intrapulmonary shunt contributing to hypoxemia. The patient requires ongoing mechanical ventilation, and the goal is to maintain a saturation of >89%. There is concern for persistent hepatopulmonary syndrome, and the patient may require further evaluation.

The patient's hemodynamic status is also concerning, with a low platelet count (13 K/uL) and evidence of bleeding. The patient has received multiple platelet transfusions, but the platelet count remains low. The etiology of the thrombocytopenia is unclear, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.

The patient's liver function is impaired, with evidence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The patient has ascites, and lactulose and rifaximin have been prescribed to manage this condition.

The patient's cardiovascular status is stable, with a sinus rhythm and a blood pressure of 150/62 mmHg. However, there is concern for possible cardiac complications, including a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and a potential right-to-left shunt.

The patient's neurologic status is sedated, and the patient is unable to provide a history. The patient's skin is warm, and there is no evidence of bleeding or other significant skin lesions.

The patient's laboratory results are concerning, with evidence of liver dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with a prolonged PT and PTT.

Based on the patient's complex medical condition, the following potential medical complications are present:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a high risk of further deterioration.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and liver dysfunction increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's PFO and potential right-to-left shunt increase the risk of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and cardiac failure.
4. Neurologic complications: The patient's sedated state and inability to provide a history increase the risk of neurologic complications, including seizures and cerebral edema.
5. Liver failure: The patient's cirrhosis and portal hypertension increase the risk of liver failure, which could lead to further complications, including bleeding and encephalopathy.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and respiratory failure increase the risk of infection, particularly pneumonia and sepsis.
7. Thrombotic complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and liver dysfunction increase the risk of thrombotic complications, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

Based on the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's status and to address any potential complications promptly. Further evaluation and treatment are needed to determine the underlying causes of the patient's thrombocytopenia and to optimize the patient's respiratory and hemodynamic status."

   last 24-30 hours.  Picture is concerning for pulmonary edema vs.
   pulmonary hemorrhage or both.  O2 sats now in the 70s on maximum
   ventillatory support.  SBPs 75-80 on 2 pressors (levophed and
   vasopressin).
   - start neosynephrine for additional BP support
   - lasix 40 mg IV and lasix gtt to diurese
   - blood product support: PRBCs, FFP, platelets
   - will actively follow through-out the day.
   #. Hypoxia on presentation: Initially felt that multiple processes
   could be contributing: Cardiac shunt, PE, intrinsic lung disease,
   pneumonia, and HPS.  Initially got O2 sats >90% by keeping MAPs > 70
   with levophed and blood products.  MAP improves with platelets and FFP
   infusion.  Suggests that shunting may be playing a significant role.
   Hypoxia Most likely HPS with some cardiac shunting and L-sided PNA.  To
   address these different possible etiologies:
    - Cardiac shunt
 evidence for this with PFO on TTE on [**3-28**]. Right
   heart catheterization showed R to L shunt, probable PFO and
   hepatopulmonary syndrome contributing
   - HPS
 likely given underlying cirrhosis and suggested by shunt
   study.  Will f/u hepatology recs as below.  Consider starting
   pentyoxyphylline.
    - PE
 possible given patient
s prolonged OSH course.  Have deferred
   starting heparin given pending HIT Ab panel.  Prelim read on chest CT
   is no PE in central vessels, although limited study.
    - Intrinsic lung disease
 history of IPF from OSH notes, but does not
   appear so based on CXR.  Path from OSH biopsy now in [**State 5354**] and
   unobtainable for several days.  Does not appear to be significant IPF
   on chest CT.
    - Infection / PNA - has LLL infiltrate on CXR though cannot account
   for all of the patient
s hypoxia.
             - Cont. vanco/zosyn for HAP,
             - check induced sputum for PCP given [**Name9 (PRE) 4849**] steroid use.
             - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider
   adding caspo or vori if decompensates
   - Patient still on FIO2 80% and not waking up this morning.  O2 sats
   still upper 80s to low 90s, not yet ready for extubation.
   #. Hypotension: Cause unclear this morning.  Most likely due to volume
   loss in the setting of bleeding, though could be a component of sepsis
   as well.
   - support with pressors as above.
   - support with blood products as above
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Unable to increase platelets despite multiple
   transfusions over the past 48+ hours.  HIT Ab neg here and at OSH.
   Smear unremarkable.  DIC labs negative.  Patient is already on steroids
   if ITP is contributing.  Trial yesterday suggests that antibodies may
   not necessarily be playing a role.  Hematology is following, their
   assistance is appreciated.
   - ABO matched (type B) platelets for now. Consider HLA matched
   platelets
   - Vancomycin was stopped [**3-30**].  Will stop zosyn [**3-31**] as possible
   medication effect could be contributing.
   - PPI changed to Ranitidine [**3-31**]
   - f/u heme recs
   #. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegaly and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.  Patient with tender abdomen.
   Diagnostic para: c/w portal HTN, no SBP
   - lactulose/rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs: no new recs
   - Add direct/indirect bilirubin to labs
   #. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppressions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.  Hct 42 on initial
   presentation to OSH and between 38 and 40 until [**3-18**].  Unclear why the
   precipitous drop recently.  Retic count elevated (6.6), iron low, B12 &
   folate sufficient. DIC labs negative.  HIT as neg x2.   Peripheral
   smear not suggestive.
   - iron supplementation
   - guaiac pos stools, only on prophylactic anticoagulation
   - F/u bilirubin breakdown
   #. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, infection, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   - CT head
   #. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. Will trend.
   #. Renal failure: Baseline from OSH is ~1.0, now improved to 0.9.
   Likely elevated BUN/Cr ratio which may represent prerenal state and
   GIB.
   - Follow and try to determine baseline status
   #. Diarrhea: Was being treated as c.diff though toxin negative at OSH
   and again here x2. [**Month (only) 8**] have also been due to lactulose.
   - Hold on PO vanco or flagyl unless decompensates then resend for C.
   diff.
   #. COPD: Initially treated as primary diagnosis at time of admission to
   OSH. On steroid taper at OSH and appears to have received 50mg on day
   of transfer.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis and COPD who was admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and is now being transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient has acute hypoxic decompensation, with O2 sats in the 70s on maximum ventilatory support, and is also experiencing hypotension, thrombocytopenia, anemia, altered mental status, and hyponatremia. The patient has a grave prognosis given his acute decompensation and low reserve.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Edema vs. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: The patient's CXRs have continued to worsen over the past 24-30 hours, and the picture is concerning for pulmonary edema vs. pulmonary hemorrhage or both.
2. Hepatopulmonary Syndrome (HPS): The patient has underlying cirrhosis and a shunt study suggests HPS, which may be contributing to his hypoxia.
3. Cardiac Shunt: The patient has a PFO on TTE and right heart catheterization showed a R-to-L shunt, which may be contributing to his hypoxia.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has a LLL infiltrate on CXR, which may be contributing to his hypoxia.
5. Infection: The patient has a prolonged OSH course and has been treated with antibiotics, but the infection may not be fully controlled.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has had multiple transfusions over the past 48 hours, but his platelet count remains low, and he is at risk for bleeding.
7. Anemia: The patient has a low Hct and may be experiencing marrow suppression due to EtOH and GIB.
8. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, hypoxia, or infection.
9. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which may be due to SIADH or hypovolemic shock.
10. Renal Failure: The patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.0 and is at risk for prerenal azotemia and acute kidney injury.
11. Diarrhea: The patient has diarrhea, which may be due to C. diff or lactulose.
12. COPD: The patient has COPD, which may be contributing to his hypoxia and respiratory failure.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory, cardiac, and hepatic status, as well as treatment of his infections and bleeding."

   transfusing ABO-matched plt (type B); will check HLA match on monday;
   check DIC labs & coags; no need to increase steroids
   - ETT advanced
   - sputum sample sent
   - Received 1 unit [** **] and 5 units platelets in 24 hours
   - Overnight vent settings were adjusted to try to increase PaO2 which
   dropped to the 40s. No success with increasing PEEP, placing on CMV, or
   giving lasix.
   - lasix 20 mg IV x 1 for low PaO2 and ?pulm edema on CXR
   - This morning patient acutely decompensated following suctioning with
   pink frothy sputum and dropping his O2 sats from the upper 80s to
   82-83%.  Sedation increased as patient was coughing and fighting the
   vent.  SBP subsequently dropped.

   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD admitted to an OSH
   with SOB now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia
   #. Acute hypoxic decompensation: CXRs have continued to worsen over the
   last 24-30 hours.  Picture is concerning for pulmonary edema vs.
   pulmonary hemorrhage or both.  O2 sats now in the 70s on maximum
   ventillatory support.  SBPs ~80 on 2 pressors (levophed and
   vasopressin).
   - start neosynephrine for additional BP support
   -
   #. Hypoxia on presentation: Initially felt that multiple processes
   could be contributing: Cardiac shunt, PE, intrinsic lung disease,
   pneumonia, and HPS.  Initially got O2 sats >90% by keeping MAPs > 70
   with levophed and blood products.  MAP improves with platelets and FFP
   infusion.  Suggests that shunting may be playing a significant role.
   Hypoxia Most likely HPS with some cardiac shunting and L-sided PNA.  To
   address these different possible etiologies:
    - Cardiac shunt
 evidence for this with PFO on TTE on [**3-28**]. Right
   heart catheterization showed R to L shunt, probable PFO and
   hepatopulmonary syndrome contributing
   - HPS
 likely given underlying cirrhosis and suggested by shunt
   study.  Will f/u hepatology recs as below.  Consider starting
   pentyoxyphylline.
    - PE
 possible given patient
s prolonged OSH course.  Have deferred
   starting heparin given pending HIT Ab panel.  Prelim read on chest CT
   is no PE in central vessels, although limited study.
    - Intrinsic lung disease
 history of IPF from OSH notes, but does not
   appear so based on CXR.  Path from OSH biopsy now in [**State 5354**] and
   unobtainable for several days.  Does not appear to be significant IPF
   on chest CT.
    - Infection / PNA - has LLL infiltrate on CXR though cannot account
   for all of the patient
s hypoxia.
             - Cont. vanco/zosyn for HAP,
             - check induced sputum for PCP given [**Name9 (PRE) 4849**] steroid use.
             - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider
   adding caspo or vori if decompensates
   - Patient still on FIO2 80% and not waking up this morning.  O2 sats
   still upper 80s to low 90s, not yet ready for extubation.
   2. Hypotension: Resolving.  Patient initially required levophed for
   blood pressure support and to help maintain O2 sats.  Underlying
   etiology unclear but may include sedation, shunt physiology, infection,
   and underlying liver disease.  Levophed now weaned off.
   - w/u of other problems as above and below
   - [**Name (NI) **] improving intravascular volume
   3. Thrombocytopenia: Unable to increase platelets despite 8 units in 24
   hours (5 since 8 pm last night).  HIT Ab neg here and at OSH.  Smear
   unremarkable.  DIC labs negative.  Patient is already on steroids if
   ITP is contributing.  Hematology is following, their assistance is
   appreciated.
   - Vancomycin was stopped [**3-30**].  Will stop zosyn [**3-31**] as possible
   medication effect could be contributing.
   - change PPI to Ranitidine
   - f/u heme recs
   4. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegaly and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.  Patient with tender abdomen.
   Diagnostic para: c/w portal HTN, no SBP
   - lactulose/rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs: no new recs
   - Add direct/indirect bilirubin to labs
   5. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppressions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.  Hct 42 on initial
   presentation to OSH and between 38 and 40 until [**3-18**].  Unclear why the
   precipitous drop recently.  Retic count elevated (6.6), iron low, B12 &
   folate sufficient. DIC labs negative.  HIT as neg x2.   Peripheral
   smear not suggestive.
   - iron supplementation
   - guaiac pos stools, only on prophylactic anticoagulation
   - F/u bilirubin breakdown
   6. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, infection, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   - CT head
   7. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. Will trend.
   8. Renal failure: Baseline from OSH is ~1.0, now improved to 1.1.
   Likely elevated BUN/Cr ratio which may represent prerenal state and
   GIB.
   - Follow and try to determine baseline status
   9. Diarrhea: Was being treated as c.diff though toxin negative at OSH
   and again here x2. [**Month (only) 8**] have also been due to lactulose.
   - Hold on PO vanco or flagyl unless decompensates then resend for C.
   diff.
   10. COPD: Initially treated as primary diagnosis at time of admission
   to OSH. On steroid taper at OSH and appears to have received 50mg on
   day of transfer.
   - Continue taper
   - Albuterol/atrovent
   FEN: Cont TF, [**Month (only) **] and Plts as needed
   PPX: Pneumoboots; Ranitidine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD admitted to an OSH
   with SOB now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia
   #. Acute hypoxic decompensation: CXRs have continued to worsen over the
   last 24-30 hours.  Picture is concerning for pulmonary edema vs.
   pulmonary hemorrhage or both.  O2 sats now in the 70s on maximum
   ventillatory support.  SBPs ~80 on 2 pressors (levophed and
   vasopressin).
   - start neosynephrine for additional BP support
   -
   #. Hypoxia on presentation: Initially felt that multiple processes
   could be contributing: Cardiac shunt, PE, intrinsic lung disease,
   pneumonia, and HPS.  Initially got O2 sats >90% by keeping MAPs > 70
   with levophed and blood products.  MAP improves with platelets and FFP
   infusion.  Suggests that shunting may be playing a significant role.
   Hypoxia Most likely HPS with some cardiac shunting and L-sided PNA.  To
   address these different possible etiologies:
    - Cardiac shunt
 evidence for this with PFO on TTE on [**3-28**]. Right
   heart catheterization showed R to L shunt, probable PFO and
   hepatopulmonary syndrome contributing
   - HPS
 likely given underlying cirrhosis and suggested by shunt
   study.  Will f/u hepatology recs as below.  Consider starting
   pentyoxyphylline.
    - PE
 possible given patient
s prolonged OSH course.  Have deferred
   starting heparin given pending HIT Ab panel.  Prelim read on chest CT
   is no PE in central vessels, although limited study.
    - Intrinsic lung disease
 history of IPF from OSH notes, but does not
   appear so based on CXR.  Path from OSH biopsy now in [**State 5354**] and
   unobtainable for several days.  Does not appear to be significant IPF
   on chest CT.
    - Infection / PNA - has LLL infiltrate on CXR though cannot account
   for all of the patient
s hypoxia.
             - Cont. vanco/zosyn for HAP,
             - check induced sputum for PCP given [**Name9 (PRE) 4849**] steroid use.
             - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider
   adding caspo or vori if decompensates
   - Patient still on FIO2 80% and not waking up this morning.  O2 sats
   still upper 80s to low 90s, not yet ready for extubation.
   2. Hypotension: Resolving.  Patient initially required levophed for
   blood pressure support and to help maintain O2 sats.  Underlying
   etiology unclear but may include sedation, shunt physiology, infection,
   and underlying liver disease.  Levophed now weaned off.
   - w/u of other problems as above and below
   - [**Name (NI) **] improving intravascular volume
   3. Thrombocytopenia: Unable to increase platelets despite 8 units in 24
   hours (5 since 8 pm last night).  HIT Ab neg here and at OSH.  Smear
   unremarkable.  DIC labs negative.  Patient is already on steroids if
   ITP is contributing.  Hematology is following, their assistance is
   appreciated.
   - Vancomycin was stopped [**3-30**].  Will stop zosyn [**3-31**] as possible
   medication effect could be contributing.
   - change PPI to Ranitidine
   - f/u heme recs
   4. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegaly and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.  Patient with tender abdomen.
   Diagnostic para: c/w portal HTN, no SBP
   - lactulose/rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs: no new recs
   - Add direct/indirect bilirubin to labs
   5. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppressions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.  Hct 42 on initial
   presentation to OSH and between 38 and 40 until [**3-18**].  Unclear why the
   precipitous drop recently.  Retic count elevated (6.6), iron low, B12 &
   folate sufficient. DIC labs negative.  HIT as neg x2.   Peripheral
   smear not suggestive.
   - iron supplementation
   - guaiac pos stools, only on prophylactic anticoagulation
   - F/u bilirubin breakdown

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis and COPD who was admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and is now being transferred to the ICU for further evaluation of hypoxia.

The patient's condition has deteriorated over the past 24-30 hours, with worsening chest X-rays, and he is now requiring maximum ventilatory support to maintain oxygen saturation in the 70s. He has a history of pulmonary embolism, and the preliminary chest CT scan is negative for PE in central vessels, although the study is limited.

The patient has multiple medical conditions, including:

1. Acute hypoxic decompensation: The patient's oxygen saturation has dropped to the 70s, and he is requiring maximum ventilatory support. The CXRs have worsened over the past 24-30 hours, suggesting pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, or both.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 33, and he has received 8 units of platelets in 24 hours, but his platelet count has not improved. He is on steroids, which may be contributing to his thrombocytopenia.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, and he has required pressors to maintain blood pressure. The underlying cause of his hypotension is unclear, but it may be related to sedation, shunt physiology, infection, or underlying liver disease.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, which is likely contributing to his thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and liver dysfunction.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 8.6 g/dL, and he has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be contributing to his anemia.
6. Altered mental status: The patient is likely experiencing altered mental status due to hypoxia, hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, and infection.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, and he is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin.
8. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level is 1.1, and he has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be contributing to his renal failure.
9. Diarrhea: The patient has a history of diarrhea, which may be related to lactulose or c. diff.

The patient's medical team is considering the following potential medical complications:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's CXRs have worsened over the past 24-30 hours, suggesting pulmonary edema.
2. Pulmonary hemorrhage: The patient's CXRs have also suggested pulmonary hemorrhage.
3. Hepatopulmonary syndrome: The patient's underlying cirrhosis and history of gastrointestinal bleeding may be contributing to his hypoxia.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia, and his white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an ongoing infection.
5. Cardiac shunt: The patient's preliminary echocardiogram suggested a right-to-left shunt, which may be contributing to his hypoxia.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continuing to provide maximum ventilatory support to maintain oxygen saturation.
2. Administering neosynephrine to support blood pressure.
3. Stopping vancomycin and zosyn to treat potential infection.
4. Considering starting pentyoxyphylline to treat hepatopulmonary syndrome.
5. Continuing to monitor the patient's platelet count and considering additional platelet transfusions.
6. Treating the patient's anemia with iron supplementation and considering additional treatments for gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Continuing to monitor the patient's renal function and considering additional treatments for renal failure.
8. Treating the patient's diarrhea with lactulose and rifaximin.
9. Considering additional treatments for the patient's altered mental status, including antibiotics and antifungals.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU for now."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD admitted to an OSH
   with SOB now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia
   1. Hypoxia: Initially felt that multiple processes could be
   contributing: Cardiac shunt, PE, intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, and
   HPS.  Initially got O2 sats >90% by keeping MAPs > 70 with levophed and
   blood products.  MAP improves with platelets and FFP infusion.
   Suggests that shunting may be playing a significant role.  Hypoxia Most
   likely HPS with some cardiac shunting and L-sided PNA.  To address
   these different possible etiologies:
    - Cardiac shunt
 evidence for this with PFO on TTE on [**3-28**]. Right
   heart catheterization showed R to L shunt, probable PFO and
   hepatopulmonary syndrome contributing
   - HPS
 likely given underlying cirrhosis and suggested by shunt
   study.  Will f/u hepatology recs as below.  Consider starting
   pentyoxyphylline.
    - PE
 possible given patient
s prolonged OSH course.  Have deferred
   starting heparin given pending HIT Ab panel.  Prelim read on chest CT
   is no PE in central vessels, although limited study.
    - Intrinsic lung disease
 history of IPF from OSH notes, but does not
   appear so based on CXR.  Path from OSH biopsy now in [**State 5354**] and
   unobtainable for several days.  Does not appear to be significant IPF
   on chest CT.
    - Infection / PNA - has LLL infiltrate on CXR though cannot account
   for all of the patient
s hypoxia.
             - Cont. vanco/zosyn for HAP,
             - check induced sputum for PCP given [**Name9 (PRE) 4849**] steroid use.
             - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider
   adding caspo or vori if decompensates
   - Patient still on FIO2 80% and not waking up this morning.  O2 sats
   still upper 80s to low 90s, not yet ready for extubation.
   2. Hypotension: Resolving.  Patient initially required levophed for
   blood pressure support and to help maintain O2 sats.  Underlying
   etiology unclear but may include sedation, shunt physiology, infection,
   and underlying liver disease.  Levophed now weaned off.
   - w/u of other problems as above and below
   - [**Name (NI) **] improving intravascular volume
   3. Thrombocytopenia: Unable to increase platelets despite 8 units in 24
   hours (5 since 8 pm last night).  HIT Ab neg here and at OSH.  Smear
   unremarkable.  DIC labs negative.  Patient is already on steroids if
   ITP is contributing.  Hematology is following, their assistance is
   appreciated.
   - Vancomycin was stopped [**3-30**].  Will stop zosyn [**3-31**] as possible
   medication effect could be contributing.
   - change PPI to Ranitidine
   - f/u heme recs
   4. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegaly and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.  Patient with tender abdomen.
   Diagnostic para: c/w portal HTN, no SBP
   - lactulose/rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs: no new recs
   - Add direct/indirect bilirubin to labs
   5. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppressions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.  Hct 42 on initial
   presentation to OSH and between 38 and 40 until [**3-18**].  Unclear why the
   precipitous drop recently.  Retic count elevated (6.6), iron low, B12 &
   folate sufficient. DIC labs negative.  HIT as neg x2.   Peripheral
   smear not suggestive.
   - iron supplementation
   - guaiac pos stools, only on prophylactic anticoagulation
   - F/u bilirubin breakdown
   6. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, infection, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   - CT head
   7. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. Will trend.
   8. Renal failure: Baseline from OSH is ~1.0, now improved to 1.1.
   Likely elevated BUN/Cr ratio which may represent prerenal state and
   GIB.
   - Follow and try to determine baseline status
   9. Diarrhea: Was being treated as c.diff though toxin negative at OSH
   and again here x2. [**Month (only) 8**] have also been due to lactulose.
   - Hold on PO vanco or flagyl unless decompensates then resend for C.
   diff.
   10. COPD: Initially treated as primary diagnosis at time of admission
   to OSH. On steroid taper at OSH and appears to have received 50mg on
   day of transfer.
   - Continue taper
   - Albuterol/atrovent

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis and COPD who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe hypoxia. The patient has undergone several interventions, including platelet and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) infusions, and has been treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) for suspected pneumonia.

The patient's condition remains unstable, with ongoing hypoxia and hypotension. The patient's platelet count is thrombocytopenic, and the patient has been receiving platelet transfusions. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, with elevated bilirubin and transaminases.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS): The patient's underlying cirrhosis and liver dysfunction may contribute to HPS, which can lead to severe hypoxia and respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and underlying liver disease may increase the risk of infection, including pneumonia, sepsis, and Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) colitis.
3. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy may increase the risk of bleeding, including gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage.
4. Encephalopathy: The patient's liver dysfunction and electrolyte imbalances may contribute to encephalopathy, which can lead to altered mental status, seizures, and coma.
5. Renal failure: The patient's underlying kidney disease and potential prerenal state may increase the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD and potential HPS may increase the risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to mechanical ventilation and long-term respiratory support.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's underlying cardiac disease and potential cardiac shunt may increase the risk of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest.

To address these potential complications, the patient will require continued close monitoring and management in the ICU. This may include adjustments to his medications, including anticoagulation therapy and antibiotics, as well as ongoing management of his respiratory and cardiac status."

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male with cirrhosis now admit with hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of what appears to be left sided pneumonia, no evidence
   of PE, PFO but no active R->L shunt at catheterization yesterday and
   concern for persistent hepatopulmonary syndrome but with limited
   capacity to evaluate further.  What we are left with is a significant
   persistent oxygen requirement and this is driven by intrapulmonary
   shunt in large part with pneumonia, atelectasis and some component of
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome.  The pneumonia and atelectasis may well be
   dynamic and will work to optimize status as we move to try extubation.
   1)Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure-  Secondary to above
   - sats decreased furthur this morning in the setting of suctioned
   pink-frothy secretions and xray showing diffuse infiltrates/white out.
   - Zosyn to continue, off vanc due to thrombocytopenia
   - Will maintain on CMV with slightly higher PEEPs given CHF vs alveolar
   hemorrhage vs less likely new infection
    2) Acute blood loss anemia
   - No evidence of hemolysis, checking repeat smear
   - appears to have bloody ETT secretions
   - Did have paracentesis [**3-30**] and there was concern for IP bleeding but
   not suggested on CT scan 3/28which did not show RP bleeding
   3) Acute thrombocytopenia
   - refractory to transfusions, ? ITP vs HIT unlikely
   - appreciate heme recs. platelets are ABO matched, will need HLA
   matched
   - on steroids for COPD but may require higher doses
   - Zosyn and Vanc were d/c'd
   - switch PPI to H2 blocker
    4) Cirrhosis-
   -Lactulose/Rifax for MS
   [**Name13 (STitle) 5378**] up OB pos stools
   - Ascites without evidence of infection
   5) Shock
   - question of sedation vs less likely hemorrhagic/hypovolemic
   - being transfused plat, FFP and PRBC x 1

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with cirrhosis who was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and suspected left-sided pneumonia. He has been experiencing persistent oxygen requirements, which are driven by intrapulmonary shunt, pneumonia, atelectasis, and possibly hepato-pulmonary syndrome. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with decreased oxygen saturation, and he has developed red frothy sputum, hypotension, and desaturation after receiving Lasix.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 7 K/uL
* Elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 4.9 K/uL
* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 522 IU/L
* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) of 46/76 IU/L
* Elevated bilirubin of 5.3 mg/dL
* Elevated d-dimer of 4349 ng/mL
* Elevated lactic acid of 3.0 mmol/L

The patient's medication regimen includes:

* Vancomycin, which was discontinued due to thrombocytopenia
* Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), which will continue
* Fentanyl, midazolam, and norepinephrine infusions
* Lasix for fluid management
* Steroids for COPD
* H2 blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis

The patient's plan includes:

* Continued treatment with Zosyn for pneumonia
* Optimization of respiratory status to attempt extubation
* Maintenance on CMV with slightly higher PEEPs given CHF vs alveolar hemorrhage vs less likely new infection
* Monitoring for bleeding complications, including IP bleeding
* Refractory thrombocytopenia, possibly due to ITP or HIT, requiring HLA-matched platelets and higher doses of steroids
* Management of cirrhosis, including lactulose and rifaximin for MS and ascites without evidence of infection

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of hypoxemic respiratory failure
* Development of acute kidney injury or liver failure
* Increased risk of bleeding complications, including IP bleeding and hemorrhagic shock
* Progression of thrombocytopenia and potential development of bleeding diathesis
* Increased risk of sepsis and multi-organ failure
* Development of hepato-pulmonary syndrome, which may worsen respiratory status."
