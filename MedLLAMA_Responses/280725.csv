   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p AVR on coumadin, admitted with septic shock
   likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient has leukocytosis and fever, making septic
   shock most likely.  Most likely source pneumonia given significant
   consolidations on chest CT, however per family patient was without
   significant pulmonary complains.  Alternative source would be RLE
   cellulitis.  Will evaluate for other sources with blood, urine,  stool
   cultures, but no other localizing symptoms from family.  Currently on
   Levophed and Vasopressin.  Vasopressin was added overnight so that
   levophed dose could be minized.    Cortisol normal.
   - f/u culture data
   - continue levophed / vasopressin to maintain SBP
   - currently volume replete, but bolus prn for low urine output
   - follow urine output
   - continue Vanco/ Zosyn to cover severe community acquired pneumonia
   and cellulitis in a diabetic
   - hold home antihypertensives and diuretics
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with increased redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history
   of MRSA cellulitis.  Also with elevated WBC and fever.  Cellulitis is
   covered with vancomycin.  Patient is currently anticoagulated and had
   negative CTA, so will not evaluate for DVT at present as it will not
   change management.
   - continue vancomycin
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia and respiratory
   failure.  Initially on 100% FIO2 with PEEP 15 and o2 sats in low 90s.
   Likely secondary to significant bilateral pneumonia, thoguh CXR and CTA
   initially read as pulmonary edema.  Oxygen requirements have been
   reduced overnight.  BNP significantly elevated as well, so may have a
   component of CHF as well.
   - wean FIO2 to 40%  and then PEEP to 5 if possible
   - vanco/zosyn for severe community acquired pneumonia
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Patient developed hypotension following fentanyl bolus
   that responded to fluid bolus and up-titration of levophed &
   vasopressin.  Increased fentanyl however improved tachycardia.  Given
   patient
s recent onset of visual hallucinations and history of
   agitation with opioids and benzos, anticipate that sedation will be
   difficult.
   - monitor mental status.
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Patient had tachycardia overnight.  Tachycardia did
   not respond to fluid boluses for Tylenol for fever, but improved with
   increased sedation (though this caused patient to be hypotensive).
   - monitor HR on telemetry
   - consider increased sedation for tachycardia
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoaguled for A. fib and aortic valve.  Will
   hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.  No need to bridge with heparin.
   - daily INR
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Baseline Cr of 1.3.  Now 1.7.  Elevated Cr may reflect
   worsening baseline in patient with HTN and DM, with prerenal vs. atn
   component.  Urine lytes suggest patient is pre-renal.  S/p 6L IVF.
   Continues to have low urine output.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - follow uop
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   9.  CAD.  s/p CABG x 4.  EF 60%.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin, ezetemide
   - hold lisinopril
   - hold lasix
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p AVR on coumadin, admitted with septic shock
   likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient has leukocytosis and fever, making septic
   shock most likely.  Most likely source pneumonia given significant
   consolidations on chest CT, however per family patient was without
   significant pulmonary complains.  Alternative source would be RLE
   cellulitis.  Will evaluate for other sources with blood, urine,  stool
   cultures, but no other localizing symptoms from family.  Currently on
   Levophed and Vasopressin.  Vasopressin was added overnight so that
   levophed dose could be minized.    Cortisol normal.
   - f/u culture data
   - continue levophed / vasopressin to maintain SBP
   - currently volume replete, but bolus prn for low urine output
   - follow urine output
   - continue Vanco/ Zosyn to cover severe community acquired pneumonia
   and cellulitis in a diabetic
   - hold home antihypertensives and diuretics
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with increased redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history
   of MRSA cellulitis.  Also with elevated WBC and fever.  Cellulitis is
   covered with vancomycin.  Patient is currently anticoagulated and had
   negative CTA, so will not evaluate for DVT at present as it will not
   change management.
   - continue vancomycin
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia and respiratory
   failure.  Initially on 100% FIO2 with PEEP 15 and o2 sats in low 90s.
   Likely secondary to significant bilateral pneumonia, thoguh CXR and CTA
   initially read as pulmonary edema.  Oxygen requirements have been
   reduced overnight.  BNP significantly elevated as well, so may have a
   component of CHF as well.
   - wean FIO2 to 40%  and then PEEP to 5 if possible
   - vanco/zosyn for severe community acquired pneumonia
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Patient developed hypotension following fentanyl bolus
   that responded to fluid bolus and up-titration of levophed &
   vasopressin.  Increased fentanyl however improved tachycardia.  Given
   patient
s recent onset of visual hallucinations and history of
   agitation with opioids and benzos, anticipate that sedation will be
   difficult.
   - monitor mental status.
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Patient had tachycardia overnight.  Tachycardia did
   not respond to fluid boluses for Tylenol for fever, but improved with
   increased sedation (though this caused patient to be hypotensive).
   - monitor HR on telemetry
   - consider increased sedation for tachycardia
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoaguled for A. fib and aortic valve.  Will
   hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.  No need to bridge with heparin.
   - daily INR
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Baseline Cr of 1.3.  Now 1.7.  Elevated Cr may reflect
   worsening baseline in patient with HTN and DM, with prerenal vs. atn
   component.  Urine lytes suggest patient is pre-renal.  S/p 6L IVF.
   Continues to have low urine output.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - follow uop
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   9.  CAD.  s/p CABG x 4.  EF 60%.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin, ezetemide
   - hold lisinopril
   - hold lasix
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p AVR on coumadin, admitted with septic shock
   likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient has leukocytosis and fever, making septic
   shock most likely.  Most likely source pneumonia given significant
   consolidations on chest CT, however per family patient was without
   significant pulmonary complains.  Alternative source would be RLE
   cellulitis.  Will evaluate for other sources with blood, urine,  stool
   cultures, but no other localizing symptoms from family.  Currently on
   Levophed and Vasopressin.  Vasopressin was added overnight so that
   levophed dose could be minized.    Cortisol normal.
   - f/u culture data
   - continue levophed / vasopressin to maintain SBP
   - currently volume replete, but bolus prn for low urine output
   - follow urine output
   - continue Vanco/ Zosyn to cover severe community acquired pneumonia
   and cellulitis in a diabetic
   - hold home antihypertensives and diuretics
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with increased redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history
   of MRSA cellulitis.  Also with elevated WBC and fever.  Cellulitis is
   covered with vancomycin.  Patient is currently anticoagulated and had
   negative CTA, so will not evaluate for DVT at present as it will not
   change management.
   - continue vancomycin
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia and respiratory
   failure.  Initially on 100% FIO2 with PEEP 15 and o2 sats in low 90s.
   Likely secondary to significant bilateral pneumonia, thoguh CXR and CTA
   initially read as pulmonary edema.  Oxygen requirements have been
   reduced overnight.  BNP significantly elevated as well, so may have a
   component of CHF as well.
   - wean FIO2 to 40%  and then PEEP to 5 if possible
   - vanco/zosyn for severe community acquired pneumonia
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Patient developed hypotension following fentanyl bolus
   that responded to fluid bolus and up-titration of levophed &
   vasopressin.  Increased fentanyl however improved tachycardia.  Given
   patient
s recent onset of visual hallucinations and history of
   agitation with opioids and benzos, anticipate that sedation will be
   difficult.
   - monitor mental status
   - prn haldol for agitation to avoid hypotension
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Patient had tachycardia overnight.  Tachycardia did
   not respond to fluid boluses for Tylenol for fever, but improved with
   increased sedation (though this caused patient to be hypotensive).
   - monitor HR on telemetry
   - consider haldol for tachycardia if seems to be from agitation
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoaguled for A. fib and aortic valve.  Will
   hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.  No need to bridge with heparin.
   - daily INR
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Baseline Cr of 1.3.  Now 1.7.  Elevated Cr may reflect
   worsening baseline in patient with HTN and DM, with prerenal vs. atn
   component.  Urine lytes suggest patient is pre-renal.  S/p 6L IVF.
   Continues to have low urine output.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - follow uop
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   9.  CAD.  s/p CABG x 4.  EF 60%.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin, ezetemide
   - hold lisinopril
   - hold lasix
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p AVR on coumadin, admitted with septic shock
   likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient has leukocytosis and fever, making septic
   shock most likely.  Most likely source pneumonia given significant
   consolidations on chest CT, however per family patient was without
   significant pulmonary complains.  Alternative source would be RLE
   cellulitis.  Will evaluate for other sources with blood, urine,  stool
   cultures, but no other localizing symptoms from family.  Currently on
   Levophed and Vasopressin.  Vasopressin was added overnight so that
   levophed dose could be minized.    Cortisol normal.
   - f/u culture data
   - continue levophed / vasopressin to maintain SBP
   - currently volume replete, but bolus prn for low urine output
   - follow urine output
   - continue Vanco/ Zosyn to cover severe community acquired pneumonia
   and cellulitis in a diabetic
   - hold home antihypertensives and diuretics
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with increased redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history
   of MRSA cellulitis.  Also with elevated WBC and fever.  Cellulitis is
   covered with vancomycin.  Patient is currently anticoagulated and had
   negative CTA, so will not evaluate for DVT at present as it will not
   change management.
   - continue vancomycin
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia and respiratory
   failure.  Initially on 100% FIO2 with PEEP 15 and o2 sats in low 90s.
   Likely secondary to significant bilateral pneumonia, thoguh CXR and CTA
   initially read as pulmonary edema.  Oxygen requirements have been
   reduced overnight.  BNP significantly elevated as well, so may have a
   component of CHF as well.
   - wean FIO2 to 40%  and then PEEP to 5 if possible
   - vanco/zosyn for severe community acquired pneumonia
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Patient developed hypotension following fentanyl bolus
   that responded to fluid bolus and up-titration of levophed &
   vasopressin.  Increased fentanyl however improved tachycardia.  Given
   patient
s recent onset of visual hallucinations and history of
   agitation with opioids and benzos, anticipate that sedation will be
   difficult.
   - monitor mental status
   - prn haldol for agitation to avoid hypotension
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Patient had tachycardia overnight.  Tachycardia did
   not respond to fluid boluses for Tylenol for fever, but improved with
   increased sedation (though this caused patient to be hypotensive).
   - monitor HR on telemetry
   - consider haldol for tachycardia if seems to be from agitation
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoaguled for A. fib and aortic valve.  Will
   hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.  No need to bridge with heparin.
   - daily INR
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Baseline Cr of 1.3.  Now 1.7.  Elevated Cr may reflect
   worsening baseline in patient with HTN and DM, with prerenal vs. atn
   component.  Urine lytes suggest patient is pre-renal.  S/p 6L IVF.
   Continues to have low urine output.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - follow uop
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   9.  CAD.  s/p CABG x 4.  EF 60%.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin, ezetemide
   - hold lisinopril
   - hold lasix
   .

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old male admitted to the ICU with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulitis. He has a history of CAD, type 2 DM, HTN, and HL. He is currently intubated for hypoxia and respiratory failure. His vital signs are tachycardic, with a heart rate of 94 bpm, and his blood pressure is labile, ranging from 70s to 100s systolic. He has a fever of 101.2°F and is receiving vasopressors and antibiotics. His laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated troponin levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient is at risk of continued septic shock due to the ongoing infection and potential bacteremia.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he may require continued mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of CAD and may be at risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or infarction.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he may be at risk of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient has a history of visual hallucinations and may be at risk of further neurological complications such as seizures or stroke.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a history of type 2 DM and may be at risk of gastrointestinal complications such as diabetic gastroparesis or pancreatitis.
7. Infection Control: The patient is at risk of developing secondary infections, particularly in the respiratory and urinary tracts, due to his compromised immune status.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's plan includes continued antibiotics and vasopressors, as well as close monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory results. The patient will also require ongoing respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy. The patient's cardiac status will need to be closely monitored, and he may require further cardiac testing or treatment. The patient's renal function will need to be closely monitored, and he may require further treatment or dialysis. The patient's neurological status will need to be closely monitored, and he may require further treatment or neuroimaging studies."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y/o M w/MMP admitted with fever, septic shock, and respiratory
   failure.
   1. Shock:  Likely due to sepsis given possible sources of infection
   (pneumonia, cellulitis).  Overnight required addition of vasopressin
   and uptitration of levophed.  CVP is 12 suggesting adequate volume
   resuscitation.
   - cont levo & vasopressin, wean levo if tolerated
   - vanc/zosyn
   - cortisol level was appropriate so no role for steroids
   2. Respiratory failure:  Due to combination of multifocal pneumonia and
   pulmonary edema.
   - FiO2 weaned down overnight
   - adequate oxygenation on ABG, can wean peep also
   - hypotension limits ability to diurese
   3. Agitation:  Required increasing doses of fentanyl overnight which
   subsequently resulted in hypotension.
   - start haldol
   - monitor QTc
   3. Mechanical AVR: Holding coumadin.  INR 3.3.  Start heparin if INR
   drops below 2, as some risk for thrombosis given mechanical valve.
   4. ARF:  Likely component of prerenal azotemia with underlying renal
   disease.  Will monitor.
   - urine lytes also consistent with prerenal physiology
   5. DM: Insulin sliding scale.
   6. CAD: Cont aspirin & statin.  Hold lasix and lisinopril given shock.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y/o M w/MMP admitted with fever, septic shock, and respiratory
   failure.
   1. Shock:  Likely due to sepsis given possible sources of infection
   (pneumonia, cellulitis).  Overnight required addition of vasopressin
   and uptitration of levophed.  CVP is 12 suggesting adequate volume
   resuscitation.
   - cont levo & vasopressin, wean levo if tolerated
   - vanc/zosyn
   - cortisol level was appropriate so no role for steroids
   2. Respiratory failure:  Due to combination of multifocal pneumonia and
   pulmonary edema.
   - FiO2 weaned down overnight
   - adequate oxygenation on ABG, can wean peep also
   - hypotension limits ability to diurese
   3. Agitation:  Required increasing doses of fentanyl overnight which
   subsequently resulted in hypotension.
   - start haldol
   - monitor QTc
   3. Mechanical AVR: Holding coumadin.  INR 3.3.  Start heparin if INR
   drops below 2, as some risk for thrombosis given mechanical valve.
   4. ARF:  Likely component of prerenal azotemia with underlying renal
   disease.  Will monitor.
   - urine lytes also consistent with prerenal physiology
   5. DM: Insulin sliding scale.
   6. CAD: Cont aspirin & statin.  Hold lasix and lisinopril given shock.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male admitted with septic shock, fever, and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.2°F (38.4°C)
* Heart rate: 98 bpm (normal range: 60-100 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 112/51 mmHg (normal range: 90-140/60-90 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (normal range: 12-20 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 100% (normal range: 95-100%)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 22.8 K/uL (normal range: 4-11 K/uL)
* Hematocrit: 41.8% (normal range: 40-54%)
* Platelet count: 283 K/uL (normal range: 150-450 K/uL)
* Creatinine: 1.7 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 20 mEq/L (normal range: 7-18 mEq/L)
* Glucose: 88 mg/dL (normal range: 70-110 mg/dL)

The patient's imaging studies show bilateral pleural effusions and increased pulmonary vascular markings.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Shock: likely due to sepsis, requiring continued vasopressin and levophed, with weaning of levophed if tolerated
* Respiratory failure: due to multifocal pneumonia and pulmonary edema, requiring FiO2 weaning and PEEP weaning
* Agitation: requiring haldol and monitoring of QTc
* Mechanical AVR: holding coumadin and starting heparin if INR drops below 2
* ARF: likely prerenal azotemia with underlying renal disease, requiring monitoring
* DM: insulin sliding scale
* CAD: continue aspirin and statin, hold lasix and lisinopril given shock

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

* Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, or cardiovascular instability
* Respiratory failure, including worsening hypoxia or hypercapnia
* Cardiovascular instability, including hypotension or hypertension
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to stress ulcer disease
* Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility
* Infection-related complications, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections
* Renal failure or electrolyte imbalance due to prerenal azotemia
* Metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia due to insulin sliding scale therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y/o M w/MMP admitted with fever, septic shock, and respiratory
   failure.
   1. Shock:  Likely due to sepsis given possible sources of infection
   (pneumonia, cellulitis).  Overnight required addition of vasopressin
   and uptitration of levophed.  CVP is 12 suggesting adequate volume
   resuscitation.
   - cont levo & vasopressin, wean levo if tolerated
   - vanc/zosyn
   - cortisol level was appropriate so no role for steroids
   2. Respiratory failure:  Due to combination of multifocal pneumonia and
   pulmonary edema.
   - FiO2 weaned down overnight
   - adequate oxygenation on ABG, can wean peep also
   - hypotension limits ability to diurese
   3. Agitation:  Required increasing doses of fentanyl overnight which
   subsequently resulted in hypotension.
   - start haldol
   - monitor QTc
   3. Mechanical AVR: Holding coumadin.  INR 3.3.  Start heparin if INR
   drops below 2, as some risk for thrombosis given mechanical valve.
   4. ARF:  Likely component of prerenal azotemia with underlying renal
   disease.  Will monitor.
   - urine lytes also consistent with prerenal physiology
   5. DM: Insulin sliding scale.
   6. CAD: Cont aspirin & statin.  Hold lasix and lisinopril given shock.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock is likely to worsen due to the presence of multi-organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmia, and renal dysfunction.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can lead to further respiratory compromise and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Agitation and Delirium: The patient's agitation and delirium may worsen due to the underlying sepsis, and may require increasing doses of sedatives, which can further compromise the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypotension may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock.
5. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) may progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD), which can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications and mortality.
6. Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy: The patient's sepsis may lead to sepsis-associated encephalopathy, which can result in altered mental status, confusion, and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Multi-Organ Dysfunction Syndrome: The patient's sepsis may lead to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), which can result in failure of multiple organs, including the kidneys, liver, and lungs.
8. Infection-Related Complications: The patient's sepsis may lead to infection-related complications, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bacteremia, which can further compromise the patient's health and increase the risk of mortality.

To address these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and aggressive management of their sepsis, including the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasopressors, and other supportive therapies as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple comorbidities and complex medical conditions. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.1°F (38.4°C)
* Heart rate: 96 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 136/73 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and their electrocardiogram (ECG) shows an irregular rhythm. They are receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and vasopressors.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 19.9 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 266 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.7 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 22 mg/dL
* Glucose: 88 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.9 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.8 g/dL
* Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.0 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their critical condition, but they are unable to assess their peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic status.

The patient has a high risk of developing medical complications, including:

* Sepsis: The patient's temperature is elevated, and they have a high white blood cell count, which may indicate an underlying infection.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, and their respiratory rate is high, which may indicate respiratory distress.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and their ECG shows an irregular rhythm, which may indicate cardiac instability.
* Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy, and their platelet count is low, which may increase their risk of bleeding.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate renal impairment or failure.
* Infection: The patient is at risk of developing hospital-acquired infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: Replete with fiber
* Glycemic control: Monitoring and management of blood glucose levels
* Lines: Multiple lines, including arterial and central lines
* Prophylaxis: Stress ulcer prophylaxis, DVT prophylaxis, and VAP prophylaxis
* Medications: Multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and vasopressors

Overall, the patient is a high-risk individual who requires close monitoring and management in the ICU."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-inch tall individual with a temperature of 101.1°F (38.4°C) and a heart rate of 96 beats per minute. The patient is receiving various medications, including haldol, midazolam, fentanyl, and vasopressin, to manage agitation, sedation, and blood pressure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 136/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 15 mmHg, and the patient is receiving fluid infusions.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 19.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 266 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, with a potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L, sodium level of 135 mEq/L, and chloride level of 109 mEq/L.

The patient's respiratory support includes a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST, with a tidal volume of 650-720 mL and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100%, and the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) is 298 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the patient's intubation and sedation. The patient's skin, neurologic, and peripheral vascular examinations are not assessed.

The patient's assessment and plan include repletion with fiber, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation suggest the possibility of respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation and use of vasopressin suggest the possibility of cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant medications and presence of stress ulcers suggest the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis suggests the possibility of deep vein thrombosis.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: The patient's prophylaxis for ventilator-associated pneumonia suggests the possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's use of tube feeds and repletion with fiber suggest the possibility of nutritional deficiencies.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's use of insulin and presence of hyperglycemia suggest the possibility of hyperglycemia."

   Sputum culture [**10-20**] with sparse coag+ staph growth
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p mechanical AVR on coumadin, admitted with
   septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits.
   .
   1.Septic shock.  Patient weaned off of pressors overnight. Still with
   fever spike to 101 overnight on vanc/zosyn with most likely cause of
   septic shock from pulmonary or cellulitic source. Sputum culture grew
   out sparse coag + staph. Patient with h/o MRSA cellulitis in LLE
   although now with increasing RLE erythema
   - restart low dose metoprolol for rate control, watching BP closely
   - continue vanc/zosyn for coverage of CAP and cellulitis in a diabetic
   patient
   - f/u culture data
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with increased redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history
   of MRSA cellulitis.  Also with elevated WBC and fever.  Cellulitis is
   covered with vancomycin/zosyn.  Currently no concern for necrotizing
   fascitis or myositis, but mark area and follow exam
   - continue vancomycin/zosyn
   - mark area of erythema
   - add on CK
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia and respiratory
   failure.  Initially on 100% FIO2 with PEEP 15 and o2 sats in low 90s.
   Now weaning down with RISB in Am of 61, then 100.  Likely secondary to
   PNA. Sputum culture pending.  BNP significantly elevated as well, so
   may have a component of CHF as well.
   - RISB and wean down to CPAP from AC
   - continue vanco/zosyn for severe community acquired pneumonia, f/u
   cultures
   - IV lasix for diuresis if no self-diuresis
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Patient started on IV haldol overnight and able to wean
   down on sedation, although still on fentanyl boluses
   - monitor mental status as patient with h/o agitation/hallucinations
   - change haldol to standing, continue wean down on fentanyl
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Patient had tachycardia after vasopressin weaned off.
   Patient on 100mg TID of metoprolol at home. BP has been stable
   - restart metoprolol at low dose and titrate up as tolerated for HR

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   .
   1.Septic shock.  Patient weaned off of pressors overnight. Still with
   fever spike to 101 overnight on vanc/zosyn with most likely cause of
   septic shock from pulmonary or cellulitic source. Sputum culture grew
   out sparse coag + staph. Patient with h/o MRSA cellulitis in LLE
   although now with increasing RLE erythema
   - restart low dose metoprolol for rate control, watching BP closely
   - continue vanc/zosyn for coverage of CAP and cellulitis in a diabetic
   patient
   - f/u culture data
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with increased redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history
   of MRSA cellulitis.  Also with elevated WBC and fever.  Cellulitis is
   covered with vancomycin/zosyn.  Currently no concern for necrotizing
   fascitis or myositis, but mark area and follow exam
   - continue vancomycin/zosyn
   - mark area of erythema
   - add on CK
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia and respiratory
   failure.  Initially on 100% FIO2 with PEEP 15 and o2 sats in low 90s.
   Now weaning down with RISB in Am of 61, then 100.  Likely secondary to
   PNA. Sputum culture pending.  BNP significantly elevated as well, so
   may have a component of CHF as well.
   - RISB and wean down to CPAP from AC
   - continue vanco/zosyn for severe community acquired pneumonia, f/u
   cultures
   - IV lasix for diuresis if no self-diuresis
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Patient started on IV haldol overnight and able to wean
   down on sedation, although still on fentanyl boluses
   - monitor mental status as patient with h/o agitation/hallucinations
   - change haldol to standing, continue wean down on fentanyl
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Patient had tachycardia after vasopressin weaned off.
   Patient on 100mg TID of metoprolol at home. BP has been stable
   - restart metoprolol at low dose and titrate up as tolerated for HR
   control
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoagulated for A. fib and mechanical aortic
   valve.  Will hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.
   - daily INR
   - consider bridging with coumadin when INR lower than 2.5
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Baseline Cr of 1.3.  Continues to decrease, 1.4 this AM.
   Urine lytes suggest patient is pre-renal.  S/p 6L IVF.
   - follow uop and Cr
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   9.  CAD.  s/p CABG x 4.  EF 60%.
   - continue aspirin

   Disposition:ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided medical progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

**Patient's Condition:**
The patient is a 73-year-old male admitted to the ICU with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and right lower extremity (RLE) cellulitis. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with preserved ejection fraction (EF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and history of mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) on coumadin.

**Current Status:**
The patient's fever has spiked to 101.1°F, and he remains tachycardic with a heart rate of 100-110 beats per minute (bpm). His blood pressure is stable, and he is still intubated for respiratory failure. His respiratory support includes continuous mechanical ventilation (CMV) with assist, and he is weaning down from the ventilator.

**Medical Complications:**
The patient is at risk for several medical complications, including:

1. **Septic Shock:** The patient's septic shock is likely secondary to pulmonary or cellulitic sources, and he is receiving coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn).
2. **Cellulitis:** The patient has a history of MRSA cellulitis in his left lower extremity (LLE) and now presents with increasing erythema, warmth, and pain in his RLE. Cellulitis is covered with vancomycin and Zosyn.
3. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient is intubated for hypoxia and respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia. Sputum culture is pending.
4. **Tachycardia:** The patient's tachycardia is likely secondary to his underlying condition and is being managed with metoprolol.
5. **Anticoagulation:** The patient is anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation (AF) and mechanical AVR, and his coumadin will be held for now and monitored.
6. **Acute Renal Failure (ARF):** The patient's baseline creatinine (Cr) is 1.3, and it has decreased to 1.4. He is at risk for pre-renal ARF and is receiving intravenous fluids (IVF).
7. **Type 2 DM:** The patient's last HbA1c is 6.1, and he is at risk for hyperglycemia. His glyburide has been held, and he is receiving insulin sliding scale.

**Plan:**
The patient's plan includes:

1. Weaning off pressors and monitoring his blood pressure.
2. Continuing coverage with vancomycin and Zosyn for septic shock and cellulitis.
3. Monitoring his respiratory status and weaning down to CPAP from AC.
4. Managing his tachycardia with metoprolol.
5. Holding coumadin and monitoring his INR.
6. Following up on his ARF and adjusting his IVF as needed.
7. Managing his type 2 DM with insulin sliding scale and monitoring his fingersticks.

**ICU Care:**
The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition repletion with fiber, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Sputum culture [**10-20**] with sparse coag+ staph growth
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p mechanical AVR on coumadin, admitted with
   septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits.
   .
   1.Septic shock.  Patient weaned off of pressors overnight. Still with
   fever spike to 101 overnight on vanc/zosyn with most likely cause of
   septic shock from pulmonary or cellulitic source. Sputum culture grew
   out sparse coag + staph. Patient with h/o MRSA cellulitis in LLE
   although now with increasing RLE erythema
   - restart low dose metoprolol for rate control, watching BP closely
   - continue vanc/zosyn for coverage of CAP and cellulitis in a diabetic
   patient
   - f/u culture data
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with increased redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history
   of MRSA cellulitis.  Also with elevated WBC and fever.  Cellulitis is
   covered with vancomycin/zosyn.  Currently no concern for necrotizing
   fascitis or myositis, but mark area and follow exam
   - continue vancomycin/zosyn
   - mark area of erythema
   - add on CK
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia and respiratory
   failure.  Initially on 100% FIO2 with PEEP 15 and o2 sats in low 90s.
   Now weaning down with RISB in Am of 61, then 100.  Likely secondary to
   PNA. Sputum culture pending.  BNP significantly elevated as well, so
   may have a component of CHF as well.
   - RISB and wean down to CPAP from AC
   - continue vanco/zosyn for severe community acquired pneumonia, f/u
   cultures
   - IV lasix for diuresis if no self-diuresis
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Patient started on IV haldol overnight and able to wean
   down on sedation, although still on fentanyl boluses
   - monitor mental status as patient with h/o agitation/hallucinations
   - change haldol to standing, continue wean down on fentanyl
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Patient had tachycardia after vasopressin weaned off.
   Patient on 100mg TID of metoprolol at home. BP has been stable
   - restart metoprolol at low dose and titrate up as tolerated for HR
   control
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoagulated for A. fib and mechanical aortic
   valve.  Will hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.
   - daily INR
   - consider bridging with coumadin when INR lower than 2.5
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Baseline Cr of 1.3.  Continues to decrease, 1.4 this AM.
   Urine lytes suggest patient is pre-renal.  S/p 6L IVF.
   - follow uop and Cr
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   9.  CAD.  s/p CABG x 4.  EF 60%.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin, ezetemide
   - hold lisinopril
   - hold lasix
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition:ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of mechanical aortic valve replacement. He is currently admitted to the ICU with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and right lower extremity (RLE) cellulitis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tachycardic to 100-110 bpm, with a temperature of 101.1°F (38.4°C).
* Respiratory support: Intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 720 mL.
* Cardiovascular: Weaned off vasopressin and levophed, with a blood pressure of 136/73 mmHg.
* Renal function: Creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, with a baseline creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL and a decrease in urine output.
* Hemodynamics: Central venous pressure (CVP) of 15 mmHg, with a cardiac index of 2.5 L/min/m².

The patient is receiving antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and cellulitis, and is also on anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation. He is being managed with a combination of medications, including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, fentanyl, midazolam, and insulin sliding scale.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing septic shock and fever suggest that he may continue to be at risk for sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate and tidal volume suggest that he may be at risk for respiratory failure.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate cardiovascular instability.
4. Renal failure: The patient's decreased urine output and increasing creatinine levels suggest that he may be at risk for renal failure.
5. Infection: The patient's cellulitis and pneumonia may lead to further infection and sepsis.
6. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase his risk of bleeding.
7. Neurological compromise: The patient's sedation and potential for respiratory failure may lead to neurological compromise.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and antibiotics may increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or diarrhea.

Based on this information, the patient's care plan should focus on managing his septic shock, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular instability, while also monitoring for potential complications such as renal failure, infection, bleeding, and neurological compromise."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p AVR on coumadin, admitted with septic shock
   likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient has leukocytosis and fever, making septic
   shock most likely.  Most likely source pneumonia given significant
   consolidations on chest CT, however per family patient was without
   significant pulmonary complains.  Alternative source would be RLE
   cellulitis.  Will evaluate for other sources with blood, urine,  stool
   cultures, but no other localizing symptoms from family.  Currently on
   Levophed and Vasopressin.  Vasopressin was added overnight so that
   levophed dose could be minized.    Cortisol normal.
   - f/u culture data
   - continue levophed / vasopressin to maintain SBP
   - currently volume replete, but bolus prn for low urine output
   - follow urine output
   - continue Vanco/ Zosyn to cover severe community acquired pneumonia
   and cellulitis in a diabetic
   - hold home antihypertensives and diuretics
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with increased redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history
   of MRSA cellulitis.  Also with elevated WBC and fever.  Cellulitis is
   covered with vancomycin.  Patient is currently anticoagulated and had
   negative CTA, so will not evaluate for DVT at present as it will not
   change management.
   - continue vancomycin
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia and respiratory
   failure.  Initially on 100% FIO2 with PEEP 15 and o2 sats in low 90s.
   Likely secondary to significant bilateral pneumonia, thoguh CXR and CTA
   initially read as pulmonary edema.  Oxygen requirements have been
   reduced overnight.  BNP significantly elevated as well, so may have a
   component of CHF as well.
   - wean FIO2 to 40%  and then PEEP to 5 if possible
   - vanco/zosyn for severe community acquired pneumonia
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Patient developed hypotension following fentanyl bolus
   that responded to fluid bolus and up-titration of levophed &
   vasopressin.  Increased fentanyl however improved tachycardia.  Given
   patient
s recent onset of visual hallucinations and history of
   agitation with opioids and benzos, anticipate that sedation will be
   difficult.
   - monitor mental status
   - prn haldol for agitation to avoid hypotension
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Patient had tachycardia overnight.  Tachycardia did
   not respond to fluid boluses for Tylenol for fever, but improved with
   increased sedation (though this caused patient to be hypotensive).
   - monitor HR on telemetry
   - consider haldol for tachycardia if seems to be from agitation
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoaguled for A. fib and aortic valve.  Will
   hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.  No need to bridge with heparin.
   - daily INR
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Baseline Cr of 1.3.  Now 1.7.  Elevated Cr may reflect
   worsening baseline in patient with HTN and DM, with prerenal vs. atn
   component.  Urine lytes suggest patient is pre-renal.  S/p 6L IVF.
   Continues to have low urine output.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - follow uop
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   9.  CAD.  s/p CABG x 4.  EF 60%.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin, ezetemide
   - hold lisinopril
   - hold lasix
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p AVR on coumadin, admitted with septic shock
   likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient has leukocytosis and fever, making septic
   shock most likely.  Most likely source pneumonia given significant
   consolidations on chest CT, however per family patient was without
   significant pulmonary complains.  Alternative source would be RLE
   cellulitis.  Will evaluate for other sources with blood, urine,  stool
   cultures, but no other localizing symptoms from family.  Currently on
   Levophed and Vasopressin.  Vasopressin was added overnight so that
   levophed dose could be minized.    Cortisol normal.
   - f/u culture data
   - continue levophed / vasopressin to maintain SBP
   - currently volume replete, but bolus prn for low urine output
   - follow urine output
   - continue Vanco/ Zosyn to cover severe community acquired pneumonia
   and cellulitis in a diabetic
   - hold home antihypertensives and diuretics
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with increased redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history
   of MRSA cellulitis.  Also with elevated WBC and fever.  Cellulitis is
   covered with vancomycin.  Patient is currently anticoagulated and had
   negative CTA, so will not evaluate for DVT at present as it will not
   change management.
   - continue vancomycin
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia and respiratory
   failure.  Initially on 100% FIO2 with PEEP 15 and o2 sats in low 90s.
   Likely secondary to significant bilateral pneumonia, thoguh CXR and CTA
   initially read as pulmonary edema.  Oxygen requirements have been
   reduced overnight.  BNP significantly elevated as well, so may have a
   component of CHF as well.
   - wean FIO2 to 40%  and then PEEP to 5 if possible
   - vanco/zosyn for severe community acquired pneumonia
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Patient developed hypotension following fentanyl bolus
   that responded to fluid bolus and up-titration of levophed &
   vasopressin.  Increased fentanyl however improved tachycardia.  Given
   patient
s recent onset of visual hallucinations and history of
   agitation with opioids and benzos, anticipate that sedation will be
   difficult.
   - monitor mental status
   - prn haldol for agitation to avoid hypotension
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Patient had tachycardia overnight.  Tachycardia did
   not respond to fluid boluses for Tylenol for fever, but improved with
   increased sedation (though this caused patient to be hypotensive).
   - monitor HR on telemetry
   - consider haldol for tachycardia if seems to be from agitation
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoaguled for A. fib and aortic valve.  Will
   hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.  No need to bridge with heparin.
   - daily INR
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Baseline Cr of 1.3.  Now 1.7.  Elevated Cr may reflect
   worsening baseline in patient with HTN and DM, with prerenal vs. atn
   component.  Urine lytes suggest patient is pre-renal.  S/p 6L IVF.
   Continues to have low urine output.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - follow uop
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   9.  CAD.  s/p CABG x 4.  EF 60%.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin, ezetemide
   - hold lisinopril
   - hold lasix
   .

Summary:

The patient, a 73-year-old male, is a critical care unit (ICU) admission with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and right lower extremity (RLE) cellulitis. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with preserved ejection fraction, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and a history of left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis. He is intubated for hypoxia and respiratory failure, and is receiving vasopressors to maintain systolic blood pressure. His fever has been managed with antipyretics, and his sedation is being weaned.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock is likely to continue, and he may require further vasopressor support to maintain blood pressure.
2. Cellulitis: The patient's RLE cellulitis may progress, and he may require further antibiotic coverage.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, and he may require further mechanical ventilation support.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may continue, and he may require further sedation and/or beta-blocker therapy.
5. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's ARF may worsen, and he may require further fluid management and/or dialysis.
6. Type 2 DM: The patient's type 2 DM may require further management, including insulin therapy and/or metformin.
7. CAD: The patient's CAD may require further management, including aspirin and statin therapy.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may require further management, including antihypertensive therapy.
9. Atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient's AF may require further management, including anticoagulation therapy.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue vasopressors to maintain systolic blood pressure.
2. Monitor for signs of septic shock, including hypotension, tachycardia, and decreased urine output.
3. Continue antibiotic coverage for pneumonia and cellulitis.
4. Wean sedation and monitor for signs of agitation or tachycardia.
5. Monitor for signs of ARF, including increased serum creatinine and decreased urine output.
6. Manage type 2 DM with insulin therapy and/or metformin.
7. Manage CAD with aspirin and statin therapy.
8. Manage hypertension with antihypertensive therapy.
9. Manage AF with anticoagulation therapy.

   2)Resp Failure- Good RSBI today- will repeat and try to keep on PS if
   looks good. Very thick secretions reported, will follow.
   3)ARF- Improved, Fluid balance has been positive. Consider Lasix if
   continues to run positive today.
   4)Cellulitis- WBC decreasing, no fever since noon yesterday, off
   pressors, so unlikely deeper infection like necrotizing fasciitis, but
   quite extensive, will repeat exam later in day and closely follow.
   Consider surgical consult if continues to extend.
   5)Neuro- continue Haldol, change to standing and wean sedation.
   fentanyl for pain.
   6)CV- tachycardia, will increase metoprolol to home dosing as long as
   BP stable.cont asa, statin, zetia.
   7)Heme- anticoagulated for mechanical AVR and afib. Check coags today.
   Holding coumadin for now, start Heparin if INR<2.5.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   1)Sepsis- RLE cellulitis/pna. Cont Vanc/Zosyn. Clinically improved in
   that he is off pressors, but cellulitis extensive, ?spreading.
   2)Resp Failure- Good RSBI today- will repeat and try to keep on PS if
   looks good. Very thick secretions reported, will follow.
   3)ARF- Improved, Fluid balance has been positive. Consider Lasix if
   continues to run positive today.
   4)Cellulitis- WBC decreasing, no fever since noon yesterday, off
   pressors, so unlikely deeper infection like necrotizing fasciitis, but
   quite extensive, will repeat exam later in day and closely follow.
   Consider surgical consult if continues to extend.
   5)Neuro- continue Haldol, change to standing and wean sedation.
   fentanyl for pain.
   6)CV- tachycardia, will increase metoprolol to home dosing as long as
   BP stable.cont asa, statin, zetia.
   7)Heme- anticoagulated for mechanical AVR and afib. Check coags today.
   Holding coumadin for now, start Heparin if INR<2.5.
   8) FEN- on tube feeds.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 73-year-old male admitted with sepsis and respiratory failure secondary to right lower extremity (RLE) cellulitis and pneumonia (PNA).
* The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, with a respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 650 mL.
* The patient has a fever of 101.1°F (38.4°C) and is tachycardic with a heart rate of 121 beats per minute.
* The patient's blood pressure is 127/65 mmHg, and his central venous pressure (CVP) is 15 mmHg.
* The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 19.9 K/μL, a hematocrit of 36.8%, and a platelet count of 266 K/μL.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen if the cellulitis continues to spread or if there is a secondary infection.
* Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the respiratory rate increases or if the tidal volume decreases.
* Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's AKI may worsen if the fluid balance continues to be positive or if the creatinine level increases.
* Cellulitis: The patient's cellulitis may worsen if it continues to spread or if there is a secondary infection.
* Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status may worsen if the sedation is not properly managed or if there is a secondary neurological injury.
* Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiovascular status may worsen if the tachycardia persists or if there is a secondary cardiovascular event.

**Assessment and Plan:**

* The patient's sepsis and respiratory failure will be closely monitored, and antibiotics will be continued.
* The patient's cellulitis will be reassessed, and a surgical consult will be considered if the cellulitis continues to spread.
* The patient's AKI will be monitored, and a diuretic may be considered if the fluid balance continues to be positive.
* The patient's sedation will be managed, and the patient will be weaned off sedation as tolerated.
* The patient's cardiovascular status will be monitored, and a beta blocker may be considered if the tachycardia persists.

**ICU Care:**

* The patient will continue to receive mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
* The patient will receive tube feeds and will be repleted with fiber.
* The patient will receive prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
* The patient's laboratory results will be closely monitored, and adjustments will be made as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p mechanical AVR on coumadin, admitted with
   septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits.
   .
   1.Septic shock.  Patient weaned off of pressors and has been Afebrile
   for 48 hours on vanco/zosyn.   Sputum culture grew out sparse coag +
   staph. Patient with h/o MRSA cellulitis in LLE.  Cellulitis appears
   unchaged, but with low vanco trough, may be secondary to under-dosing.
   - continue low dose metoprolol for rate control, watching BP closely
   - continue vanc/zosyn for coverage of CAP and cellulitis in a diabetic
   patient
   - f/u culture data
   - increase vancomycin dose due to low vanco trough
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history of MRSA
   cellulitis.  Cellulitis is covered with vancomycin/zosyn.  Exam appears
   unchanged from yesterday, but little improvement.  [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p mechanical AVR on coumadin, admitted with
   septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits.
   .
   1.Septic shock.  Patient weaned off of pressors and has been Afebrile
   for 48 hours on vanco/zosyn.   Sputum culture grew out sparse coag +
   staph. Patient with h/o MRSA cellulitis in LLE.  Cellulitis appears
   unchaged, but with low vanco trough, may be secondary to under-dosing.
   - continue low dose metoprolol for rate control, watching BP closely
   - continue vanc/zosyn for coverage of CAP and cellulitis in a diabetic
   patient
   - f/u culture data
   - increase vancomycin dose due to low vanco trough
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history of MRSA
   cellulitis.  Cellulitis is covered with vancomycin/zosyn.  Exam appears
   unchanged from yesterday, but little improvement.  [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to
   under-dosing of vancomycin.  CK low yesterday.
   - monitor cellulitis clnically
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia, likely
   secondary to pneumonia +/- CHF.  On vanco/zosyn for pneumonia.
   Tolerated SBT well with RSBI of 80 today, but patient remains to
   sedated for extubation.
   - lighten sedation and evaluate for extubation later
   - discuss with family re: decision to re-intubate if necessary
   - lasix diuresis (on home dose
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Improvement of agitation with IV haldol.  QTc of 444 on
   [**10-22**].   Too sedated for extubation today, so will lighten sedation and
   re-evaluate.
   - monitor mental status as patient with h/o agitation/hallucinations
   - continue haldol
   - wean fentanyl/versed
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Patient had tachycardia after vasopressin weaned off.
   Patient on 100mg TID of metoprolol at home. BP has been stable.
   - continue metoprolol at low dose and titrate up as tolerated for HR
   control
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoagulated for A. fib and mechanical aortic
   valve.  Will hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.
   - daily INR
   - consider bridging with coumadin when INR lower than 2.5
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Creatinine now at baseline of 1.2.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow uop and Cr
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and a history of mechanical aortic valve replacement. He was admitted with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and right lower extremity cellulitis.

The patient has made some progress, including being weaned off pressors and being afebrile for 48 hours on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. However, he still has several potential medical complications that need to be closely monitored and managed.

1. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock is still ongoing, and he requires continued treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. His low vancomycin trough suggests that he may be under-dosing, and his dose should be increased.
2. Cellulitis: The patient's cellulitis in his right lower extremity has not improved, and he has a history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cellulitis. He requires continued treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and his cellulitis should be closely monitored clinically.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated and sedated, and his respiratory status should be closely monitored. He may require extubation once his sedation is weaned, and he should be assessed for potential reintubation if necessary.
4. Sedation: The patient's sedation should be closely monitored, and his mental status should be assessed regularly. He may require continued treatment with haloperidol to manage his agitation and hallucinations.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia should be closely monitored, and his metoprolol dose should be titrated up as tolerated to control his heart rate.
6. Anticoagulation: The patient is anticoagulated for his atrial fibrillation and mechanical aortic valve, and his coumadin should be held for now and monitored with daily INR checks.
7. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine is at baseline, and his medications should be renally dosed. His uop and creatinine should be closely monitored.
8. Type 2 diabetes: The patient's glycemic control should be closely monitored, and his glyburide should be held. His fingersticks should be followed regularly.
9. Coronary artery disease: The patient's CAD should be closely monitored, and his aspirin, statin, and ezetimibe should be continued. His lisinopril should be held.

In summary, the patient has several potential medical complications that require close monitoring and management. His septic shock, cellulitis, respiratory failure, sedation, tachycardia, anticoagulation, acute kidney injury, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease all need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications."

   Since the prior study of [**2168-10-21**], there has been little interval
   change.
   There is massive cardiomegaly. Mediastinum is unchanged. There is a
   small
   left pleural effusion with atelectasis or consolidation of the left
   lower
   lobe. The right lung is relatively clear. There is no failure. The
   right IJ
   catheter terminates in the superior vena cava. Nasogastric tube courses

   IMPRESSION:
   No appreciable change.
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p mechanical AVR on coumadin, admitted with
   septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits.
   .
   1.Septic shock.  Patient weaned off of pressors and has been Afebrile
   for 24 hours on vanco/zosyn.   Sputum culture grew out sparse coag +
   staph. Patient with h/o MRSA cellulitis in LLE although now with
   increasing RLE erythema
   - restart low dose metoprolol for rate control, watching BP closely
   - continue vanc/zosyn for coverage of CAP and cellulitis in a diabetic
   patient
   - f/u culture data
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with increased redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history
   of MRSA cellulitis.  Also with elevated WBC and fever.  Cellulitis is
   covered with vancomycin/zosyn.  Currently no concern for necrotizing
   fascitis or myositis, but mark area and follow exam
   - continue vancomycin/zosyn
   - mark area of erythema
   - add on CK
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia and respiratory
   failure.  Initially on 100% FIO2 with PEEP 15 and o2 sats in low 90s.
   Now weaning down with RISB in Am of 61, then 100.  Likely secondary to
   PNA. Sputum culture pending.  BNP significantly elevated as well, so
   may have a component of CHF as well.
   - RISB and wean down to CPAP from AC
   - continue vanco/zosyn for severe community acquired pneumonia, f/u
   cultures
   - IV lasix for diuresis if no self-diuresis
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Patient started on IV haldol overnight and able to wean
   down on sedation, although still on fentanyl boluses.  QTc of 444 on
   [**10-22**].
   - monitor mental status as patient with h/o agitation/hallucinations
   - change haldol to standing, continue wean down on fentanyl
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Patient had tachycardia after vasopressin weaned off.
   Patient on 100mg TID of metoprolol at home. BP has been stable
   - restart metoprolol at low dose and titrate up as tolerated for HR
   control
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoagulated for A. fib and mechanical aortic
   valve.  Will hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.
   - daily INR
   - consider bridging with coumadin when INR lower than 2.5
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Baseline Cr of 1.3.  Continues to decrease, 1.4 this AM.
   Urine lytes suggest patient is pre-renal.  S/p 6L IVF.
   - follow uop and Cr
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   9.  CAD.  s/p CABG x 4.  EF 60%.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin, ezetemide
   - hold lisinopril
   - hold lasix
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and a history of MRSA cellulitis. He was admitted to the ICU with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and right lower extremity (RLE) cellulitis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Septic shock: The patient has been weaned off pressors and has been afebrile for 24 hours on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.
* Cellulitis: The patient has a history of MRSA cellulitis in his left lower extremity (LLE) and now presents with increasing redness, warmth, and pain in his RLE.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for hypoxia and respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia. His sputum culture is pending.
* Sedation: The patient was started on IV haldol overnight and was able to wean down on sedation, although he is still on fentanyl boluses.
* Tachycardia: The patient had tachycardia after vasopressin was weaned off, and he is on metoprolol at a low dose.
* Anticoagulation: The patient is anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation and mechanical aortic valve, and his coumadin will be held for now.
* Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine was 1.3, and it has decreased to 1.4. His urine electrolytes suggest pre-renal failure.
* Type 2 diabetes: The patient's last HbA1C was 6.1, and his glyburide will be held.
* Coronary artery disease: The patient had a CABG x 4 and has an EF of 60%.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 16.6, Hct 33.9, Plt 215
* Blood chemistry: Na 138, K 3.7, Cl 108, BUN 30, Cr 1.4, Glucose 128
* Liver function tests: ALT 11-28, AST 11-28, Alk Phos 93, T Bili 1.2
* Renal function tests: Creatinine 1.4, Urea 30
* Electrolytes: Na 138, K 3.7, Cl 108, Mg 2.1, PO4 2.9
* Blood cultures: pending
* Sputum culture: pending
* Urine culture: negative

The patient's radiology results are as follows:

* Chest X-ray: massive cardiomegaly, small left pleural effusion with atelectasis or consolidation of the left lower lobe, and relatively clear right lung.

Based on the patient's condition, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening septic shock: The patient may experience further deterioration in his hemodynamic status, leading to organ failure.
2. Progression of cellulitis: The patient's cellulitis may spread to other areas of his body, leading to further complications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further hypoxia and hypercapnia.
4. Sedation-related complications: The patient's sedation regimen may lead to respiratory depression, hypotension, or other complications.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may worsen, leading to further cardiac complications.
6. Anticoagulation-related bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may lead to bleeding complications.
7. Acute kidney injury: The patient's ARF may worsen, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and other complications.
8. Type 2 diabetes: The patient's diabetes may worsen, leading to further complications such as hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, or nephropathy.
9. Coronary artery disease: The patient's CAD may worsen, leading to further cardiac complications.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for coverage of CAP and cellulitis.
2. Monitor the patient's mental status and sedation levels closely.
3. Wean the patient off sedation and fentanyl as tolerated.
4. Restart metoprolol at a low dose and titrate up as tolerated for rate control.
5. Hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.
6. Follow the patient's uop and Cr closely.
7. Hold glyburide and follow fingersticks.
8. Continue aspirin, statin, and ezetimibe.
9. Consider bridging with coumadin when INR is lower than 2.5."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p mechanical AVR on coumadin, admitted with
   septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits.
   .
   1.Septic shock.  Patient weaned off of pressors overnight. Still with
   fever spike to 101 overnight on vanc/zosyn with most likely cause of
   septic shock from pulmonary or cellulitic source. Sputum culture grew
   out sparse coag + staph. Patient with h/o MRSA cellulitis in LLE
   although now with increasing RLE erythema
   - restart low dose metoprolol for rate control, watching BP closely
   - continue vanc/zosyn for coverage of CAP and cellulitis in a diabetic
   patient
   - f/u culture data
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with increased redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history
   of MRSA cellulitis.  Also with elevated WBC and fever.  Cellulitis is
   covered with vancomycin/zosyn.  Currently no concern for necrotizing
   fascitis or myositis, but mark area and follow exam
   - continue vancomycin/zosyn
   - mark area of erythema
   - add on CK
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia and respiratory
   failure.  Initially on 100% FIO2 with PEEP 15 and o2 sats in low 90s.
   Now weaning down with RISB in Am of 61, then 100.  Likely secondary to
   PNA. Sputum culture pending.  BNP significantly elevated as well, so
   may have a component of CHF as well.
   - RISB and wean down to CPAP from AC
   - continue vanco/zosyn for severe community acquired pneumonia, f/u
   cultures
   - IV lasix for diuresis if no self-diuresis
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Patient started on IV haldol overnight and able to wean
   down on sedation, although still on fentanyl boluses.  QTc of 444 on
   [**10-22**].
   - monitor mental status as patient with h/o agitation/hallucinations
   - change haldol to standing, continue wean down on fentanyl
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Patient had tachycardia after vasopressin weaned off.
   Patient on 100mg TID of metoprolol at home. BP has been stable
   - restart metoprolol at low dose and titrate up as tolerated for HR
   control
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoagulated for A. fib and mechanical aortic
   valve.  Will hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.
   - daily INR
   - consider bridging with coumadin when INR lower than 2.5
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Baseline Cr of 1.3.  Continues to decrease, 1.4 this AM.
   Urine lytes suggest patient is pre-renal.  S/p 6L IVF.
   - follow uop and Cr
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   9.  CAD.  s/p CABG x 4.  EF 60%.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin, ezetemide
   - hold lisinopril
   - hold lasix
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Since the prior study of [**2168-10-21**], there has been little interval
   change.
   There is massive cardiomegaly. Mediastinum is unchanged. There is a
   small
   left pleural effusion with atelectasis or consolidation of the left
   lower
   lobe. The right lung is relatively clear. There is no failure. The
   right IJ
   catheter terminates in the superior vena cava. Nasogastric tube courses
   below
   the diaphragm and the tip is not seen. Endotracheal tube terminates at
   the
   thoracic inlet.
   IMPRESSION:
   No appreciable change.
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p mechanical AVR on coumadin, admitted with
   septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits.
   .
   1.Septic shock.  Patient weaned off of pressors overnight. Still with
   fever spike to 101 overnight on vanc/zosyn with most likely cause of
   septic shock from pulmonary or cellulitic source. Sputum culture grew
   out sparse coag + staph. Patient with h/o MRSA cellulitis in LLE
   although now with increasing RLE erythema
   - restart low dose metoprolol for rate control, watching BP closely
   - continue vanc/zosyn for coverage of CAP and cellulitis in a diabetic
   patient
   - f/u culture data
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with increased redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history
   of MRSA cellulitis.  Also with elevated WBC and fever.  Cellulitis is
   covered with vancomycin/zosyn.  Currently no concern for necrotizing
   fascitis or myositis, but mark area and follow exam
   - continue vancomycin/zosyn
   - mark area of erythema
   - add on CK
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia and respiratory
   failure.  Initially on 100% FIO2 with PEEP 15 and o2 sats in low 90s.
   Now weaning down with RISB in Am of 61, then 100.  Likely secondary to
   PNA. Sputum culture pending.  BNP significantly elevated as well, so
   may have a component of CHF as well.
   - RISB and wean down to CPAP from AC
   - continue vanco/zosyn for severe community acquired pneumonia, f/u
   cultures
   - IV lasix for diuresis if no self-diuresis
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Patient started on IV haldol overnight and able to wean
   down on sedation, although still on fentanyl boluses.  QTc of 444 on
   [**10-22**].
   - monitor mental status as patient with h/o agitation/hallucinations
   - change haldol to standing, continue wean down on fentanyl
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Patient had tachycardia after vasopressin weaned off.
   Patient on 100mg TID of metoprolol at home. BP has been stable
   - restart metoprolol at low dose and titrate up as tolerated for HR
   control
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoagulated for A. fib and mechanical aortic
   valve.  Will hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.
   - daily INR
   - consider bridging with coumadin when INR lower than 2.5
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Baseline Cr of 1.3.  Continues to decrease, 1.4 this AM.
   Urine lytes suggest patient is pre-renal.  S/p 6L IVF.
   - follow uop and Cr
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   9.  CAD.  s/p CABG x 4.  EF 60%.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin, ezetemide
   - hold lisinopril
   - hold lasix
   .

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a complex medical history, including CAD, type 2 DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, and mechanical AVR on coumadin. He was admitted with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulitis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Septic shock: The patient was weaned off pressors overnight, but still has a fever spike to 101°F overnight. The most likely cause of septic shock is pulmonary or cellulitic source. Sputum culture grew out sparse coag+ staph.
* Cellulitis: The patient has a history of LLE cellulitis and now presents with increased redness, warmth, and pain in RLE. He has a history of MRSA cellulitis, and the current cellulitis is covered with vancomycin/zosyn.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for hypoxia and respiratory failure. He is weaning down with RISB in the AM, and the likely cause is PNA. Sputum culture is pending.
* Sedation: The patient was started on IV haldol overnight and was able to wean down on sedation, but is still on fentanyl boluses. His QTc is 444.
* Tachycardia: The patient had tachycardia after vasopressin was weaned off. He is on 100mg TID of metoprolol at home, and his BP has been stable.
* Anticoagulation: The patient is anticoagulated for A. fib and mechanical aortic valve. His INR will be monitored daily, and he will be considered for bridging with coumadin when his INR is lower than 2.5.
* ARF: The patient's baseline Cr is 1.3, and it continues to decrease. His urine lytes suggest that he is pre-renal. He has received 6L IVF.
* Type 2 DM: The patient's last HgA1C is 6.1.
* CAD: The patient has had CABG x 4 and has an EF of 60%.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture is pending, and he may have a severe community-acquired pneumonia.
* Cellulitis: The patient has a history of MRSA cellulitis, and the current cellulitis is covered with vancomycin/zosyn. However, the patient may still develop complications such as necrotizing fasciitis or myositis.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and may develop complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or respiratory failure.
* Sedation: The patient is on IV haldol and fentanyl, and he may develop complications such as hallucinations or agitation.
* Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be related to his underlying CAD or other medical conditions.
* Anticoagulation: The patient is anticoagulated, and he may develop complications such as bleeding or thrombosis.
* ARF: The patient's ARF may progress to AKI or require dialysis.
* Type 2 DM: The patient's type 2 DM may worsen if his blood sugar is not well-controlled.
* CAD: The patient's CAD may worsen if he develops complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

In summary, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions, and he requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old male in the ICU, who was weaned off pressors and given a dose of lasix IV 20 mg. The patient has a history of allergies to Demerol, Ativan, Librium, and Valium. The patient is receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and is being managed for respiratory support with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 114/63 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute and a SpO2 of 96%. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 16.6, hemoglobin of 33.9, and platelet count of 215.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the patient is still receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation, which may indicate a risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient is receiving antibiotics, which may indicate a risk of sepsis.
3. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate a risk of infection.
4. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which may indicate a risk of bleeding.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may indicate a risk of electrolyte imbalance.
6. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate a risk of renal failure.
7. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, which may indicate a risk of hepatic failure.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, which may indicate a risk of cardiovascular instability.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
2. Continue antibiotics and monitor the patient's response to treatment.
3. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's liver function and adjust treatment as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust treatment as needed.
7. Consider consulting with a specialist, such as a pulmonologist or nephrologist, for further management of the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p mechanical AVR on coumadin, admitted with
   septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits now off
   pressors but still intubated, with plan for family meeting today.
   .
   1.Septic shock.  Patient weaned off of pressors and has been Afebrile
   for 72 hours on vanco/zosyn.   Sputum culture grew out sparse coag +
   staph. Patient with h/o MRSA cellulitis in LLE.  Cellulitis is improved
   on antibiotics.
   - continue low dose metoprolol for rate control, watching BP closely
   - continue vanc/zosyn (day#4 today) for coverage of CAP and cellulitis
   in a diabetic patient. Will recheck vanc trough tomorrow
   - f/u culture data
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Bilateral cellulitis slightly improved overnight.
   Vanc/zosyn appropriate coverage as patient has h/o MRSA cellulitis and
   is a diabetic. BCx NGTD so far
   - continue vanc/zosyn
   - monitor cellulitis clinically
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia (day 3$ today),
   likely secondary to pneumonia +/- CHF.  Patient with good diuresis
   overnight on home diuretics dose. On vanco/zosyn for pneumonia.
   Tolerated SBT well with RSBI of 80 today, but has been difficult to
   wean patient completely off sedation as he becomes agitated. Is also
   more tachypneic today.
   - family meeting planned to discuss larger goals of care today,
   including extubation. Patient may need non-invasives but may be
   difficult to tolerate given history of agitation
   - continue with diuresis
 has had good output to home PO diuretics.
   Goal 1-2L out overnight. Will give IV dose if necessary.
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Patient is now on propofol for comfort while still
   intubated. s/p versed/fentanyl drips. Has history of paranoia,
   agitation at home and we will have to deal with these issues when
   patient is more awake
   - monitor mental status as patient with h/o agitation/hallucinations
   - continue propofol as needed
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p mechanical AVR on coumadin, admitted with
   septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits now off
   pressors but still intubated, with plan for family meeting today.
   .
   1.Septic shock.  Patient weaned off of pressors and has been Afebrile
   for 72 hours on vanco/zosyn.   Sputum culture grew out sparse coag +
   staph. Patient with h/o MRSA cellulitis in LLE.  Cellulitis is improved
   on antibiotics.
   - continue low dose metoprolol for rate control, watching BP closely
   - continue vanc/zosyn (day#4 today) for coverage of CAP and cellulitis
   in a diabetic patient. Will recheck vanc trough tomorrow
   - f/u culture data
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Bilateral cellulitis slightly improved overnight.
   Vanc/zosyn appropriate coverage as patient has h/o MRSA cellulitis and
   is a diabetic. BCx NGTD so far
   - continue vanc/zosyn
   - monitor cellulitis clinically
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia (day 3$ today),
   likely secondary to pneumonia +/- CHF.  Patient with good diuresis
   overnight on home diuretics dose. On vanco/zosyn for pneumonia.
   Tolerated SBT well with RSBI of 80 today, but has been difficult to
   wean patient completely off sedation as he becomes agitated. Is also
   more tachypneic today.
   - family meeting planned to discuss larger goals of care today,
   including extubation. Patient may need non-invasives but may be
   difficult to tolerate given history of agitation
   - continue with diuresis
 has had good output to home PO diuretics.
   Goal 1-2L out overnight. Will give IV dose if necessary.
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Patient is now on propofol for comfort while still
   intubated. s/p versed/fentanyl drips. Has history of paranoia,
   agitation at home and we will have to deal with these issues when
   patient is more awake
   - monitor mental status as patient with h/o agitation/hallucinations
   - continue propofol as needed
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  BP controlled overnight on low dose metoprolol.
   Patient on 100mg TID of metoprolol at home. BP has been stable.
   - continue metoprolol at low dose and titrate up as tolerated for HR
   control
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoagulated for A. fib and mechanical aortic
   valve.  Will hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.  INR 3.1 yesterday,
   pending level for today
   - daily INR
   - consider bridging with coumadin when INR lower than 2.5
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Creatinine now at baseline of 1.2.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow uop and Cr
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   9.  CAD.  s/p CABG x 4.  EF 60%.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of CAD, type 2 DM, HTN, HL, and a previous CVA. He was admitted with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulitis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's condition is improving, with the cellulitis showing clinical improvement, and the patient being weaned off pressors. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 16.6, with a normal range of 4.5-11.5. The patient's creatinine level is 1.2, and his blood glucose level is 128.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 24 and a SpO2 of 99%. The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a heart rate of 99 and a blood pressure of 143/73 mmHg.

The patient's sedation status is stable, with the patient being on propofol for comfort while still intubated. The patient's mental status is stable, with no reports of hallucinations or agitation.

The patient's anticoagulation status is stable, with an INR of 3.1. The patient's type 2 DM is being managed with insulin sliding scale and the patient's CAD is being managed with aspirin, statin, and ezetimibe.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to his underlying pneumonia and mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his underlying infection and immunocompromised state.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient is at risk for cardiac complications due to his underlying CAD and mechanical aortic valve.
4. Neurological complications: The patient is at risk for neurological complications due to his underlying CVA and potential for sepsis.
5. Renal failure: The patient is at risk for renal failure due to his underlying type 2 DM and potential for sepsis.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his underlying cellulitis and potential for sepsis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue low-dose metoprolol for rate control and watching blood pressure closely.
2. Continue vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for coverage of CAP and cellulitis.
3. Monitor cellulitis clinically and follow up with blood cultures.
4. Continue diuresis and monitor urine output.
5. Monitor mental status and continue propofol as needed.
6. Hold coumadin and monitor INR daily.
7. Renally dose all medications and follow up with creatinine levels.
8. Manage type 2 DM with insulin sliding scale and follow up with fingersticks.
9. Continue aspirin, statin, and ezetimibe for CAD management.

The patient's family meeting is planned for today at 2 pm to discuss larger goals of care, including extubation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 71-inch tall adult with a chief complaint of cellulitis and pneumonia. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has been receiving antibiotics, sedation, and respiratory support. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°F, heart rate of 99 bpm, and blood pressure of 143/73 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is improving, with a RSBI of 87 and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a CVP of 18 mmHg and a total fluid balance of -1,895 mL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's RSBI is improving, but the patient is still on mechanical ventilation. The patient's lung function is compromised, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's condition worsens.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a diagnosis of pneumonia and cellulitis, which increases the risk of sepsis. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count and lactate level, which are indicative of inflammation.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is a risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias. The patient's heart rhythm should be closely monitored to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Thrombosis: The patient has a risk of thrombosis due to the patient's immobility and the use of anticoagulation therapy. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated platelet count, which is a risk factor for thrombosis.
5. Infection: The patient has a diagnosis of pneumonia and cellulitis, which increases the risk of infection. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count and lactate level, which are indicative of inflammation.
6. Malnutrition: The patient is at risk of malnutrition due to the patient's immobility and the use of total parenteral nutrition. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated albumin level, which is a risk factor for malnutrition.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's immobility and the use of anticoagulation therapy. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated lactate level, which is a risk factor for gastrointestinal bleeding.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but there are several potential medical complications that need to be closely monitored and managed."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p mechanical AVR on coumadin, admitted with
   septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits.
   .
   1.Septic shock.  Patient weaned off of pressors and has been Afebrile
   for 48 hours on vanco/zosyn.   Sputum culture grew out sparse coag +
   staph. Patient with h/o MRSA cellulitis in LLE.  Cellulitis appears
   unchaged, but with low vanco trough, may be secondary to under-dosing.
   - continue low dose metoprolol for rate control, watching BP closely
   - continue vanc/zosyn for coverage of CAP and cellulitis in a diabetic
   patient
   - f/u culture data
   - increase vancomycin dose due to low vanco trough
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history of MRSA
   cellulitis.  Cellulitis is covered with vancomycin/zosyn.  Exam appears
   unchanged from yesterday, but little improvement.  [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to
   under-dosing of vancomycin.  CK low yesterday.
   - monitor cellulitis clnically
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia, likely
   secondary to pneumonia +/- CHF.  On vanco/zosyn for pneumonia.
   Tolerated SBT well with RSBI of 80 today, but patient remains to
   sedated for extubation.
   - lighten sedation and evaluate for extubation later
   - discuss with family re: decision to re-intubate if necessary
   - lasix diuresis (on home dose
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Improvement of agitation with IV haldol.  QTc of 444 on
   [**10-22**].   Too sedated for extubation today, so will lighten sedation and
   re-evaluate.
   - monitor mental status as patient with h/o agitation/hallucinations
   - continue haldol
   - wean fentanyl/versed
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Patient had tachycardia after vasopressin weaned off.
   Patient on 100mg TID of metoprolol at home. BP has been stable.
   - continue metoprolol at low dose and titrate up as tolerated for HR
   control
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoagulated for A. fib and mechanical aortic
   valve.  Will hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.
   - daily INR
   - consider bridging with coumadin when INR lower than 2.5
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Creatinine now at baseline of 1.2.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow uop and Cr
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   9.  CAD.  s/p CABG x 4.  EF 60%.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin, ezetemide
   - continue home lasix
   - hold lisinopril
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The patient had a spontaneous breathing trial with a RSBI of 80, which suggests that the patient may be able to be extubated soon.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and the blood pressure is stable. The patient is receiving metoprolol to control the heart rate.
* Neurological: The patient is sedated and has a history of agitation and hallucinations. The patient is receiving haloperidol to manage agitation.
* Renal: The patient has acute kidney injury, and the creatinine level is at baseline.
* Infectious: The patient has pneumonia and cellulitis, and is receiving vancomycin and zosyn for coverage.
* Endocrine: The patient has type 2 diabetes, and the last HbA1c level was 6.1.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, but the patient's respiratory status can deteriorate quickly if the patient's oxygenation or ventilation requirements change.
* Sepsis: The patient has pneumonia and cellulitis, which can lead to sepsis if the infection is not adequately treated.
* Cardiac complications: The patient has atrial fibrillation and is receiving metoprolol to control the heart rate, but the patient may be at risk for cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
* Neurological complications: The patient has a history of agitation and hallucinations, and is receiving haloperidol to manage agitation. The patient may be at risk for neurological complications such as seizures or stroke.
* Renal complications: The patient has acute kidney injury, and the creatinine level is at baseline. The patient may be at risk for further renal deterioration or dialysis.
* Endocrine complications: The patient has type 2 diabetes, and the patient's blood glucose levels may fluctuate if the patient's insulin regimen is not adequately managed.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue low-dose metoprolol for rate control and watching BP closely
* Continue vancomycin and zosyn for coverage of CAP and cellulitis
* Increase vancomycin dose due to low vanco trough
* Monitor cellulitis clinically and follow blood cultures
* Lighten sedation and evaluate for extubation later
* Discuss with family re: decision to re-intubate if necessary
* Continue haldol and wean fentanyl/versed

   1.Septic shock.  Patient weaned off of pressors and has been Afebrile
   for 48 hours on vanco/zosyn.   Sputum culture grew out sparse coag +
   staph. Patient with h/o MRSA cellulitis in LLE.  Cellulitis appears
   unchaged, but with low vanco trough, may be secondary to under-dosing.
   - continue low dose metoprolol for rate control, watching BP closely
   - continue vanc/zosyn for coverage of CAP and cellulitis in a diabetic
   patient
   - f/u culture data
   - increase vancomycin dose due to low vanco trough
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history of MRSA
   cellulitis.  Cellulitis is covered with vancomycin/zosyn.  Exam appears
   unchanged from yesterday, but little improvement.  [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to
   under-dosing of vancomycin.  CK low yesterday.
   - monitor cellulitis clnically
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia, likely
   secondary to pneumonia +/- CHF.  On vanco/zosyn for pneumonia.
   Tolerated SBT well with RSBI of 80 today, but patient remains to
   sedated for extubation.
   - lighten sedation and evaluate for extubation later
   - discuss with family re: decision to re-intubate if necessary

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male admitted with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and right lower extremity (RLE) cellulitis. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with preserved ejection fraction, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HL), and a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Septic shock: The patient was weaned off pressors and has been afebrile for 48 hours on vancomycin (Vanco) and Zosyn. Sputum culture grew out sparse coag-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The patient has a history of MRSA cellulitis in the left lower extremity (LLE).
* Cellulitis: The patient has redness, warmth, and pain in the RLE. The cellulitis is covered with Vanco and Zosyn, but the patient's condition appears unchanged from yesterday, and the low vanco trough may be secondary to under-dosing.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for hypoxia, likely secondary to pneumonia +/- CHF. He is on Vanco and Zosyn for pneumonia and tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) well with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 80 today.
* Sedation: The patient's agitation improved with IV haloperidol (Haldol). He is too sedated for extubation today, so sedation will be lightened and re-evaluated.
* Tachycardia: The patient had tachycardia after vasopressin was weaned off. He is on 100mg TID of metoprolol at home, and his blood pressure has been stable.
* Anticoagulation: The patient is anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation (A. fib) and mechanical aortic valve. Coumadin will be held for now, and INR will be monitored daily.
* Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine is now at baseline of 1.2. Renal dose adjustments will be made for all medications, and uop and Cr will be followed.
* Type 2 DM: The patient's last HbA1C was 6.1. Glyburide will be held, and the patient will be followed with fingersticks.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Under-dosing of vancomycin: The patient's low vanco trough may lead to inadequate treatment of MRSA cellulitis and pneumonia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, requiring re-intubation.
3. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock may progress, leading to multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Anticoagulation-related bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation status may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Renal injury: The patient's ARF may worsen, requiring further management and potential dialysis.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's type 2 DM may lead to hyperglycemia, which can worsen his condition.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's CAD may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as acute coronary syndrome or heart failure.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."
