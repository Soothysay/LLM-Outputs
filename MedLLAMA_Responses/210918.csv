   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   On this day I examined Mr [**Known lastname 2536**] and was present for the key portions of
   the services provided. I also have read Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10445**]
s note above and
   concur with his findings and plan of care.  The patient has very severe
   COPD with what is felt to be baseline severe hypercarbia.  In this
   setting he was found to have a RLL endobronchial cancer at [**Hospital1 3356**] and was transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for XRT. He came to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] due to
   his
triggering
 for hypoxemia which responded nicely to BIPAP used
   here yesterday in [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  This morning he actually seems close or at his
   baseline, though does, not surprisingly, demonstrate asterixis.   As
   he
s not been on RTC bronchodilators and has been on higher than
   necessary FiO2, we will give him Alb/Ipratropium Nebs RTC and titrate
   his nasal O2 to give only Sa02 of 91-93%.  He has not needed BIPAP so
   far today, but we think his using it at night on the [**Hospital1 **] would be
   beneficial in giving his resp muscles a needed rest.  He is being
   called out today, to commence XRT.
   35 min spent in the care of this severely ill patient.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has led to acute exacerbation, and he is experiencing hypercapnic respiratory failure. This condition can worsen if not managed properly.
2. Acidosis: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to cause acidosis, which can lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and even death.
3. Hypercarbia: The patient's COPD and respiratory failure are causing hypercarbia, which can lead to neurological symptoms such as somnolence, confusion, and even coma.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and hypercarbia increase the risk of developing pneumonia, which can further complicate his condition.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's acidosis and hypercarbia can lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and even cardiac arrest.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's hypercarbia and acidosis can lead to neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, and even brain death.
7. Infection: The patient's respiratory failure and hypercarbia increase the risk of developing infections, which can further complicate his condition.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's respiratory failure and hypercarbia can lead to malnutrition, which can further complicate his condition.
9. Psychological complications: The patient's chronic illness and respiratory failure can lead to psychological complications such as anxiety, depression, and even suicidal ideation.
10. Treatment complications: The patient's respiratory failure and hypercarbia can lead to complications related to treatment, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, and even death.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent these complications from arising or worsening."

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypercarbic respiratory distress. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, and is currently experiencing an acute exacerbation. The patient has been treated with non-invasive ventilation and is currently receiving oxygen therapy. He has also been diagnosed with lung cancer and prostatic hypertrophy.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure is a significant concern, and the potential for further deterioration is high. Prolonged respiratory failure can lead to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's recent hospitalization and respiratory failure increase the risk of developing pneumonia, which can be life-threatening.
3. Sepsis: The patient's respiratory failure and underlying COPD increase the risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's respiratory failure can lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
5. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of COPD and respiratory failure increase the risk of developing a pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's respiratory failure can lead to gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's respiratory failure can lead to neurological complications such as confusion, disorientation, and seizures.
8. Infection: The patient's respiratory failure and underlying COPD increase the risk of developing an infection, which can be life-threatening.

Based on the patient's history and current condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and treatment of his respiratory failure, as well as management of his underlying COPD and other comorbidities."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 66.9 kg individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypercarbic respiratory distress. They have a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, which has led to acute respiratory failure. The patient is being treated with non-invasive ventilation, with a recent episode of tearing in the left eye and left chest wall pain.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 154/82 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 21 inspirations per minute. They are receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and have a normal electrocardiogram.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with mild anemia. Their electrolyte levels are normal, except for a slightly elevated potassium level. Their blood glucose levels are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, with symmetric chest expansion and clear breath sounds. They have trace edema in both lower extremities and are warm to the touch.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute respiratory failure may lead to further respiratory distress and failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and prolonged hospitalization may increase their risk of developing pneumonia.
3. Sepsis: The patient's chronic illness and prolonged hospitalization may increase their risk of developing sepsis.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and underlying medical conditions may increase their risk of developing DVT.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient's chronic illness and prolonged hospitalization may increase their risk of developing stress ulcer.
6. VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia): The patient's prolonged use of non-invasive ventilation may increase their risk of developing VAP.
7. Worsening of underlying medical conditions: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema may worsen during their hospitalization, leading to further respiratory distress and failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 66.9 kg male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypercarbic respiratory distress. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, with several hospitalizations for hypercapneic respiratory failure. He is currently being treated with non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP) and antibiotics. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 154/82 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula with 30% FiO2. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.34, PCO2 of 85 mmHg, and PO2 of 223 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD and acute exacerbation may lead to respiratory failure, which could worsen his condition.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's recent hospitalization and use of non-invasive ventilation may increase his risk of developing pneumonia.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's use of non-invasive ventilation may increase his risk of developing VAP.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and use of prophylactic anticoagulation may increase his risk of developing DVT.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness and use of sedatives may increase his risk of developing stress ulcer.
6. Hypercapneic respiratory failure: The patient's chronic CO2 retention and acute episodes of hypercapnea may worsen his condition.
7. Cancer progression: The patient's lung cancer may progress, leading to further complications and worsening of his condition.
8. XRT-related complications: The patient's planned radiation therapy may lead to complications such as radiation pneumonitis, esophagitis, or radiation-induced lung injury.

Recommendations:

1. Continue non-invasive ventilation and monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and ABG results.
2. Recheck ABG in the morning to assess for any changes in the patient's respiratory status.
3. Check CXR to assess for any signs of pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
4. Discuss with Rad Onc regarding possible XRT, mapping today.
5. Consult with a pulmonologist to assess the patient's COPD and develop a plan to manage his respiratory status.
6. Consider prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the risk of pneumonia.
7. Monitor the patient's vital signs and neurological status closely for any signs of worsening respiratory failure or other complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, likely due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with an acute exacerbation. He has a history of severe COPD with multiple hospitalizations for hypercapneic respiratory failure. The patient's CO2 levels are still in the 80s, and he is redirectable. He is receiving non-invasive bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) at night and standing nebulizer treatments. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 132/73 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 88%. His lab results show mild anemia, normal white blood cell count, and elevated lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's CO2 levels are still elevated, and he may require further respiratory support or consideration for invasive mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypercapnic encephalopathy: The patient's CO2 levels are still in the 80s, and he may be at risk for hypercapnic encephalopathy, which can lead to confusion, disorientation, and decreased level of consciousness.
3. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to his COPD and recent hospitalization.
4. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and mild anemia may indicate the presence of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and mortality.
5. DVT: The patient is at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to his immobility and COPD.
6. VAP: The patient is at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to his prolonged use of mechanical ventilation.
7. Malignancy progression: The patient's lung cancer may be progressing, which can lead to further respiratory compromise and decreased quality of life.
8. BPH complications: The patient's benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) may lead to complications such as urinary retention, hematuria, or recurrent urinary tract infections.

Recommendations:

1. Continue non-invasive BiPAP at night and standing nebulizer treatments.
2. Monitor the patient's CO2 levels and adjust respiratory support as necessary.
3. Consider further laboratory testing to rule out sepsis and assess the patient's nutritional status.
4. Discuss with the radiology department regarding the possibility of transferring the patient to [**Hospital1 966**] for palliative care.
5. Consider palliative care consultation to discuss the patient's goals of care and potential treatment options.
6. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to assess for any signs of deterioration or complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 66.9 kg male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has a history of severe COPD with multiple hospitalizations for hypercapnic respiratory failure. He has also been diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung with right lower lobe (RLL) mass and RLL collapse. The patient is currently receiving non-invasive bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) therapy at night and is tolerating oxygen saturation above 85%. He has a significant CO2 toxicity, with a pCO2 in the 80s, and is redirectable mentally.

Physical examination reveals signs of CO2 toxicity, including somnolence, and myoclonus on extension. He has a scaphoid abdomen, soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure of 132/73 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 88%.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, with a peak of 7.9 K/uL, and a decreased hemoglobin level, with a nadir of 8.8 g/dL. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, with a peak BUN of 143 mg/dL and a peak creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL. His glucose levels have been fluctuating, with a peak of 143 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's CO2 toxicity and hypercapnic respiratory failure pose a significant risk of respiratory failure, which may require invasive mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypercapnic encephalopathy: The patient's CO2 toxicity may lead to hypercapnic encephalopathy, which can cause confusion, agitation, and even coma.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's history of COPD and SCC may increase his risk of developing pneumonia, which can be a life-threatening complication.
4. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and BUN levels suggest a possible septic process, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
5. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and BUN levels may indicate renal failure, which can worsen his overall prognosis.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of COPD and SCC may increase his risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as pulmonary hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Malignancy progression: The patient's SCC may progress, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life.

In summary, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications, including respiratory failure, hypercapnic encephalopathy, pneumonia, sepsis, renal failure, cardiovascular complications, and malignancy progression. Close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   On this day I examined Mr [**Known lastname 2536**] and was present for the key portions of
   the services provided.  I have read Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8988**]
s note and agree with
   his findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 2536**] remains stable and reports his
   breathing is at baseline. He is alert and seems comfortable. He
   tolerates BIPAP at night and PC02 is stable to improved at 83.  His Sat
   is approx 88-90% on 2L 02.  As the patient is normally on inhaled
   steroids, we will add budesonide or fluticasone inhaled to his
   Albuterol and Ipratropium nebs q4-6hr.
   Pt is a longstanding patient of  [**Hospital1 966**] where Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10454**] did his
   LLLobectomy. I
ve been in contact with [**Name (NI) 966**] physicians and  hospitalist
   Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10455**] there has accepted the patient to the floor there, where he
   should be evaluated for [**Last Name (STitle) 357**] for his new Rt lung cancer.  I believe the
   patient is stable enough for both the transfer and for care on the
   floor, provided he remains on his bronchodilators, BIPAP at night, and
   low flow 02.  I would accept sats of 88-91 as adequate and necessary to
   help prevent C02 retention.
   45 min spent in the care of this severely ill gentleman.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted to be somewhat somnelent
   initially on the floor with an elevated pCO2.  Patient is currently
   orientated after arousal. Given his prior history of COPD likely he has
   history of CO2 retention, which improves with non-invasive BiPAP at
   night time. Pt has no history of OSA, did not receive pain medication
   prior to this episode. Likely related to his RML collapse [**1-23**] recurrent
   SCC. Pt. would benefit from palliative [**Month/Day (2) 357**], would make sense to
   transfer to [**Hospital1 966**] for [**Last Name (LF) 357**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] try to facilitate today.
   - will continue on non-invasive BiPAP
   - will tolerate O2 saturation > 85% given drive to breathe
   - Plan to transfer to the [**Hospital1 987**] for continuity of care and [**Hospital1 357**]
   .
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), LUNG
   SCC w/ RLL mass/RLL collapse: Diagnosed via Bronchoscopy at [**Hospital1 **], will need to review OSH records to confirm. Transferred for
   [**Hospital1 357**] palliative.
   - transfer to [**Hospital1 966**], with CT scan and imaging from [**Hospital1 632**]
   .
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   COPD: h.o. severe COPD with several hospitalizations for hypercapneic
   respiratory failure.
   - continue on Albuterol/Iprtropium/steroids nebs as scheduled
   - continue BiPAP overnight
 PROSTATIC HYPERTROPHY, BENIGN (BPH)
   Continue on Flomax regimen

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   On this day I examined Mr [**Known lastname 2536**] and was present for the key portions of
   the services provided.  I have read Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8988**]
s note and agree with
   his findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 2536**] remains stable and reports his
   breathing is at baseline. He is alert and seems comfortable. He
   tolerates BIPAP at night and PC02 is stable to improved at 83.  His Sat
   is approx 88-90% on 2L 02.  As the patient is normally on inhaled
   steroids, we will add budesonide or fluticasone inhaled to his
   Albuterol and Ipratropium nebs q4-6hr.
   Pt is a longstanding patient of  [**Hospital1 966**] where Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10454**] did his
   LLLobectomy. I
ve been in contact with [**Name (NI) 966**] physicians and  hospitalist
   Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10455**] there has accepted the patient to the floor there, where he
   should be evaluated for [**Last Name (STitle) 357**] for his new Rt lung cancer.  I believe the
   patient is stable enough for both the transfer and for care on the
   floor, provided he remains on his bronchodilators, BIPAP at night, and
   low flow 02.  I would accept sats of 88-91 as adequate and necessary to
   help prevent C02 retention.
   45 min spent in the care of this severely ill gentleman.

   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 548**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 549**], MD
   on:[**2176-1-7**] 16:11 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, lung cancer, and prostatic hypertrophy. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute exacerbation of COPD, and hypercapnic respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is receiving non-invasive BiPAP at night, and his pCO2 levels are stable to improved at 83. His oxygen saturation is around 88-90% on 2L of oxygen.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient's blood pressure is stable, and his heart rate is within normal limits.
* Neurological status: The patient is alert and oriented, but has some somnolent episodes. He has no history of OSA and did not receive pain medication prior to this episode.
* Laboratory results: The patient's WBC count is within normal limits, and his Hct and Plt levels are stable. His Cr levels are slightly elevated, and his TCO2 levels are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercapnic respiratory failure can worsen if he does not receive adequate respiratory support.
* COPD exacerbation: The patient's COPD can worsen if he does not receive adequate bronchodilators and oxygen therapy.
* Lung cancer progression: The patient's lung cancer can progress if he does not receive adequate treatment.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiovascular status can worsen if he develops cardiac arrhythmias or congestive heart failure.
* Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status can worsen if he develops neurological complications such as seizures or stroke.
* Infections: The patient is at risk for developing infections, particularly respiratory infections, due to his compromised immune system.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk for developing gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding or perforation due to his history of prostatic hypertrophy.

The plan of care includes:

* Continuing non-invasive BiPAP at night
* Tolerating oxygen saturation levels above 85%
* Adding inhaled steroids to the patient's nebs
* Transferring the patient to [**Hospital1 966**] for further care and treatment
* Evaluating the patient for [**Last Name (STitle) 357**] for his new right lung cancer
* Providing close monitoring and management of the patient's respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological status."
