   Cardiac cath: [**2179-2-14**]
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Severe left and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   3. Severe pulmonary hypertension.
   OSH blood culture:
 bottles positive for GPC, speciation and
   sensitivities pending
   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting evaluation for CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Transferred
   from OSH with NSTEMI, now down-trending cardiac enzymes. Given low CK,
   elevated troponin, and temporal symptoms x3 weeks, likely patient had
   acute ACS event a few weeks ago. Troponins are now down-trending.
   Patient had no anginal equivalent symptoms, which may be in the setting
   of diabetic neuropathy. Has 3VD on cardiac cath, with critical left
   main stenosis. Awaiting CABG.
   - continue ASA, beta-blocker, high dose statin
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - started low dose ACEI (captopril 6.25 mg PO TID) on CCU transfer
   given EF of 30%
   - hold heparin gtt for now, will restart when pt has anginal equivalent
   (""heart-burn"" sx)
   - plavix washout for 5 days prior to CABG
   - f/u Csurg recs
   - may need carotid US and UA as part of the pre-op eval
   - urgent surgery if chest pain / angina equivalent unresponsive to
   nitro, morphine, oxygen
   - restart heparin gtt
   - remove swan catheter today
   .
   # PUMP:  Acute decompensated diastolic congestive heart failure (EF 30%
   on TTE on [**2180-2-14**]) likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows
   elevated pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient
   with evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures) likely worsened in setting of elevated PCWP. Patient has
   evidence of both right and left sided heart failure. Received 60 mg of
   IV lasix in cath lab, and another dose of 40mg IV lasix, with good UOP.
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - lasix 40mg IV this am, with goal -1L to -1.5L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - continue ACEI (captopril) given depressed EF
   - continue BB
   - remove swan today
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates that the interstitial abnormality in the left
   lung with sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  This is concerning especially given her smoking
   history.  However, her weight loss and decreased appetite could be due
   to related to heart failure and bowel congestion, especially given her
   elevated PA pressure.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above to reduce wedge pressure
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - f/u final CTA read
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   - pt will need regular outpatient f/u
   - remove swan today
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - monitor pt on telemetry
   .
   # SOB: likely secondary to heart failure.  PE is less likely given pt
   is ambulatory, no calf pain, no recent plain rides, no asymmetric LE
   exam.
   - treat CHF as above
   - f/u on final PE-CT read
   - O2 as needed
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%
   - continue RISS
   - diabetic diet
   - bloos sugar QID
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB, captopril
   - will uptitrate captopril and down-titrate hydralazine
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin
   .
   # Positive blood culture from OSH:
 bottles positive for GPC at [**Hospital1 **].  Possible contamination but need to f/u OSH micro.
   - call [**Hospital3 **] today regarding speciation and sensitivity
   .
   # Med non-compliance:
   - SW consult
   .
   # Smoking cessation:
   - offered nicotine patch, pt refused

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD), presenting with progressive dyspnea on exertion, NSTEMI, and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. She has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient is awaiting evaluation for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) due to critical left main stenosis.

The patient's condition has been stabilized with IV lasix, and she is receiving treatment for heart failure, including a low sodium diet, fluid restriction, and strict intake and output monitoring. She is also receiving anticoagulation therapy and beta-blockers.

The patient has a positive blood culture from the previous hospital, which is pending speciation and sensitivity. She is also being treated for pulmonary hypertension, which may be related to COPD, cor pulmonale, or malignancy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of heart failure: The patient's heart failure is likely to worsen if her fluid status is not closely monitored and managed.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary hypertension and heart failure may lead to pulmonary edema, which can be life-threatening.
3. Infection: The patient's positive blood culture and pulmonary hypertension may increase her risk of infection.
4. Malignancy: The patient's symptoms of weight loss and decreased appetite may be related to an underlying malignancy, which needs to be further evaluated.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's 1st degree AV block may progress to a more serious arrhythmia if not closely monitored and managed.
6. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of smoking and pulmonary hypertension may increase her risk of pulmonary embolism.
7. Renal failure: The patient's heart failure and fluid overload may lead to renal failure if not closely monitored and managed.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary hypertension and heart failure may lead to respiratory failure if not closely monitored and managed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to closely monitor the patient's fluid status and heart function.
2. Adjust the patient's medication regimen as necessary to manage her heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.
3. Further evaluate the patient's symptoms of weight loss and decreased appetite to rule out an underlying malignancy.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust her medication regimen as necessary to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Consider further evaluation of the patient's pulmonary hypertension to determine the underlying cause and potential treatment options.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her medication regimen as necessary to prevent renal failure.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory function and adjust her medication regimen as necessary to prevent respiratory failure."

   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting evaluation for CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Transferred
   from OSH with NSTEMI (elevated troponin-T of 1.04), now down-trending.
   Given low CK, elevated troponin, and temporal symptoms x3 weeks, likely
   patient had acute ACS event a few weeks ago. Troponins are now
   down-trending. Patient had no anginal equivalent symptoms, which may be
   in the setting of diabetic neuropathy. Has 3VD on cardiac cath today.
   Awaiting CABG.
   - continue ASA, beta-blocker, high dose statin
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - started low dose ACEI (captopril 6.25 mg PO TID) on CCU transfer
   given EF of 30%
   - hold heparin gtt for now, will restart when pt has anginal equivalent
   (""heart-burn"" sx)
   - plavix washout for 5 days prior to CABG
   - f/u Csurg recs
   - may need carotid US and UA as part of the pre-op eval
   - IABP if worsening chest pain, worsening heart failure or hypotension
   .
   # PUMP:  Acute decompensated diastolic congestive heart failure (EF 30%
   on TTE on [**2180-2-14**]) likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows
   elevated pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient
   with evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures) likely worsened in setting of elevated PCWP. Patient has
   evidence of both right and left sided heart failure. Received 60 mg of
   IV lasix in cath lab, and another dose of 40mg IV lasix, with good UOP.
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - lasix 40mg IV this am, with goal -1L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - continue ACEI (captopril) given depressed EF
   - continue BB
   - no indication for IABP currently, can consider placement of IABP if
   hypotensive or heart failure worsens
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates that the interstitial abnormality in the left
   lung with sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  This is concerning especially given her smoking
   history.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above to reduce wedge pressure
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - f/u final CTA read
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   - pt will need regular outpatient f/u
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - monitor pt on telemetry
   .
   # SOB: likely secondary to heart failure.  PE is less likely given pt
   is ambulatory, no calf pain, no recent plain rides, no asymmetric LE
   exam.
   - treat CHF as above
   - f/u on final PE-CT read
   - O2 as needed
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%
   - continue RISS
   - diabetic diet
   - bloos sugar QID
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB, hydralazine, captopril
   - goal SBP 120-130s to decrease afterload: if achievable with
   metoprolol and ACEI, can consider stopping hydralazine.
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting evaluation for CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Transferred
   from OSH with NSTEMI (elevated troponin-T of 1.04), now down-trending.
   Given low CK, elevated troponin, and temporal symptoms x3 weeks, likely
   patient had acute ACS event a few weeks ago. Troponins are now
   down-trending. Patient had no anginal equivalent symptoms, which may be
   in the setting of diabetic neuropathy. Has 3VD on cardiac cath today.
   Awaiting CABG.
   - continue ASA, beta-blocker, high dose statin
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - started low dose ACEI (captopril 6.25 mg PO TID) on CCU transfer
   given EF of 30%
   - hold heparin gtt for now, will restart when pt has anginal equivalent
   (""heart-burn"" sx)
   - plavix washout for 5 days prior to CABG

   - may need carotid US and UA as part of the pre-op eval
   - IABP if worsening chest pain, worsening heart failure or hypotension
   .
   # PUMP:  Acute decompensated diastolic congestive heart failure (EF 30%
   on TTE on [**2180-2-14**]) likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows
   elevated pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient
   with evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures) likely worsened in setting of elevated PCWP. Patient has
   evidence of both right and left sided heart failure. Received 60 mg of
   IV lasix in cath lab, and another dose of 40mg IV lasix, with good UOP.
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - lasix 40mg IV this am, with goal -1L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - continue ACEI (captopril) given depressed EF
   - continue BB
   - no indication for IABP currently, can consider placement of IABP if
   hypotensive or heart failure worsens
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates that the interstitial abnormality in the left
   lung with sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  This is concerning especially given her smoking
   history.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above to reduce wedge pressure
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - f/u final CTA read
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   - pt will need regular outpatient f/u
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - monitor pt on telemetry
   .
   # SOB: likely secondary to heart failure.  PE is less likely given pt
   is ambulatory, no calf pain, no recent plain rides, no asymmetric LE
   exam.
   - treat CHF as above
   - f/u on final PE-CT read
   - O2 as needed
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%
   - continue RISS
   - diabetic diet
   - bloos sugar QID
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB, hydralazine, captopril
   - goal SBP 120-130s to decrease afterload: if achievable with
   metoprolol and ACEI, can consider stopping hydralazine.
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, presenting with acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and treatment. The patient has undergone cardiac catheterization, which revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease and severe left and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction. She has also been diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and has been treated with aspirin, beta-blocker, and high-dose statin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening Heart Failure: The patient's CHF is likely to worsen due to the severity of her left and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction, which may lead to increased pulmonary wedge pressure and further compromise her cardiac function.
2. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension may worsen due to her COPD, which could lead to further right ventricular strain and decreased cardiac output.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's COPD may lead to respiratory failure, particularly if her pulmonary hypertension worsens.
4. Infective Endocarditis: The patient's positive blood culture for Gram-positive cocci (GPC) may indicate infective endocarditis, which could lead to further cardiac complications.
5. Medication Non-Compliance: The patient's history of non-compliance with medication may lead to suboptimal treatment and worsening of her condition.
6. Smoking Cessation: The patient's smoking habit may worsen her COPD and pulmonary hypertension, and may also lead to further cardiac complications.
7. Weight Loss: The patient's unintentional weight loss may be indicative of an underlying malignancy, which could worsen her condition.
8. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's diuretic therapy may lead to electrolyte imbalance, particularly hypokalemia, which could worsen her cardiac function.
9. IABP Complications: The patient's insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) may lead to complications such as bleeding, infection, or cardiac tamponade.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and treatment in the ICU, with a focus on optimizing her cardiac function, managing her COPD and pulmonary hypertension, and preventing further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] have seen and examined the patient. I have reviewed the above note
   and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Doctor Last Name **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3287**], MD
   on:[**2180-2-15**] 15:25 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus II, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and was diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. The patient has a history of three-vessel coronary artery disease, severe left and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and severe pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 35.7°C (96.2°F)
* Heart rate: 78 bpm (65-85 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 152/87 mmHg (104-159/136 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 31 breaths per minute (18-31 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Swan-Ganz catheter in place

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Decreased breath sounds throughout the lung fields, more significantly decreased at the right base, with mild crackles at the right base and prolonged expiratory phase
* Soft, non-tender abdomen with no masses palpated
* Right groin with no hematoma or femoral bruits
* Trace pulmonary edema and warm feet

Laboratory results include:

* White blood cell count: 12.6 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 37.4%
* Platelet count: 306 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.87 ng/mL
* Glucose: 169 mg/dL
* Other lab results: PT/PTT/INR: 13.4/26.1/1.1, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 35/0.87, Ca++: 8.5 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL, PO4: 4.6 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Worsening of heart failure: The patient's heart failure is likely to worsen due to her underlying conditions, including CAD, pulmonary hypertension, and diastolic dysfunction.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's decreased lung sounds and prolonged expiratory phase suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema, which can worsen her respiratory status.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and her oxygen saturation is slightly decreased, which can indicate respiratory failure.
4. Infection: The patient's positive blood culture for GPC suggests the possibility of infection, which can worsen her overall condition.
5. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is slightly decreased, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, which can indicate renal dysfunction.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's laboratory results suggest the possibility of electrolyte imbalance, which can worsen her overall condition.
8. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is slightly decreased, which can indicate hypoxia.
9. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's 1st-degree atrioventricular block on EKG suggests the possibility of cardiac arrhythmias.
10. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood culture and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Adjust the patient's medications as needed to manage her heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and other conditions.
3. Consider transferring the patient to a step-down unit or a cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) for closer monitoring.
4. Perform a colonoscopy to evaluate the patient's weight loss and potential gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medications as needed.
6. Consider referring the patient to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management of her pulmonary hypertension.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and adjust her medications as needed.
8. Consider referring the patient to a nephrologist for further evaluation and management of her renal dysfunction.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her oxygen therapy as needed.
10. Consider referring the patient to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management of her CAD and other cardiac conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Transferred
   from OSH with NSTEMI, now down-trending cardiac enzymes. Given low CK,
   elevated troponin, and temporal symptoms x3 weeks, likely patient had
   acute ACS event a few weeks ago. Troponins are now down-trending.
   Patient had no anginal equivalent symptoms, which may be in the setting
   of diabetic neuropathy. Has 3VD on cardiac cath, with critical left
   main stenosis. Awaiting CABG.
   - continue ASA, BB, high dose statin, ACEI, heparin gtt
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - plavix washout for prior to CABG
   - f/u Csurg recs
   - may need carotid US as part of the pre-op eval
   - urgent surgery if chest pain / angina equivalent unresponsive to
   nitro, morphine, oxygen
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has evidence of both right and left sided heart
   failure, has both diastolic and systolic heart dysfunction.  EF 30% on
   TTE on [**2180-2-14**], acute decompensation that prompted this admissiion
   likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows elevated
   pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient with
   evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures), which is likely chronic, leading to RV diastolic
   dysfunction and peripheral congestion.  Her sx of SOB is likely
   secondary to heart failure.  PE is less likely given pt is ambulatory,
   no calf pain, no recent plain rides, no asymmetric LE exam.  CTA ruled
   out PE.   Pt received 40mg IV lasix x 2 yesterday am and pm, 60mg IV
   lasix at midnight (total of 140mg), approx -600cc balance over the past
   24h
   - continue BB, ACEI
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - continue lasix, with goal -1L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes while on diuresis
   - O2 as needed
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates that the interstitial abnormality in the left
   lung with sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  However, CT showed no evidence for it.  Her weight
   loss and decreased appetite could be due to related to heart failure
   and bowel congestion, especially given her elevated PA pressure.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - monitor pt on telemetry
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%
   - continue RISS
   - diabetic diet
   - blood sugar QID
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB, captopril
   - will uptitrate captopril and down-titrate hydralazine
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin
   .
   # UTI:  UA was positive on [**2-15**].  blood cx from [**Hospital3 **] grew out
   Coag neg staph, likely contamination.
   - continue cipro for 3 days for uncomplicated UTI
   - continue to trend WBC and fever
   .
   # Med non-compliance:
   - SW consult
   .
   # Smoking cessation:
   - offered nicotine patch, pt refused

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates that the interstitial abnormality in the left
   lung with sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  However, CT showed no evidence for it.  Her weight
   loss and decreased appetite could be due to related to heart failure
   and bowel congestion, especially given her elevated PA pressure.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD), presenting with progressive dyspnea on exertion, NSTEMI, and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. She is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

The patient has multiple risk factors for CAD, including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and current smoking. She has a history of ischemic heart disease, with a previous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement.

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Heart failure: With evidence of both right and left-sided heart failure, diastolic and systolic heart dysfunction, and pulmonary hypertension.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: Contributed by COPD, cor pulmonale from malignancy, and elevated wedge pressure.
3. Chronic kidney disease: With a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 31 mg/dL.
4. Acute kidney injury: With a decrease in urine output and an increase in serum creatinine.
5. Respiratory failure: With decreased breath sounds throughout the lung fields, prolonged expiratory phase, and bilateral pleural effusions.
6. Urinary tract infection (UTI): With a positive urine culture and a positive blood culture, likely due to contamination.
7. Peripheral vascular disease: With known PVD and a history of R iliac stent placement.
8. Smoker: With a history of smoking and a current smoking habit.
9. Non-compliance with medications: With a history of non-compliance with medications and a recent admission to the hospital.

The patient's current medications include:

1. Aspirin
2. Beta-blocker
3. High-dose statin
4. ACE inhibitor
5. Heparin gtt
6. Lasix
7. Captopril
8. Cipro (for UTI)

The patient's laboratory results show:

1. Hemoglobin (Hb) level: 12.7 g/dL
2. Hematocrit (Hct) level: 37.4%
3. Platelet count: 306 K/uL
4. White blood cell (WBC) count: 12.6 K/uL
5. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level: 31 mg/dL
6. Creatinine level: 0.9 mg/dL
7. Troponin-T level: 0.87 ng/mL
8. Electrolyte levels: Sodium (Na): 142 mEq/L, Potassium (K): 4.3 mEq/L, Chloride (Cl): 103 mEq/L, Bicarbonate (HCO3): 25 mEq/L

The patient's imaging studies show:

1. Cardiac catheterization: Showing 3VD and critical left main stenosis.
2. Computed tomography angiography (CTA): Ruling out pulmonary embolism (PE).
3. Chest X-ray: Showing interstitial abnormality in the left lung with nodularity.

Based on the patient's condition and laboratory results, potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: Due to the patient's history of ischemic heart disease and the presence of 1' AV block on EKG.
2. Heart failure: Due to the patient's underlying heart disease and the presence of pulmonary hypertension.
3. Respiratory failure: Due to the patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the presence of bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Acute kidney injury: Due to the patient's underlying kidney disease and the presence of hypovolemia.
5. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Due to the patient's history of UTI and the presence of a positive urine culture.
6. Peripheral vascular disease: Due to the patient's underlying PVD and the presence of a history of R iliac stent placement.
7. Non-compliance with medications: Due to the patient's history of non-compliance with medications and the presence of a recent admission to the hospital.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple comorbidities and potential medical complications. Close monitoring and management of the patient's condition are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Transferred
   from OSH with NSTEMI, now down-trending cardiac enzymes. Given low CK,
   elevated troponin, and temporal symptoms x3 weeks, likely patient had
   acute ACS event a few weeks ago. Troponins are now down-trending.
   Patient had no anginal equivalent symptoms, which may be in the setting
   of diabetic neuropathy. Has 3VD on cardiac cath, with critical left
   main stenosis. Awaiting CABG.
   - continue ASA, BB, high dose statin, ACEI, heparin gtt
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - plavix washout for prior to CABG
   - f/u Csurg recs
   - may need carotid US as part of the pre-op eval
   - urgent surgery if chest pain / angina equivalent unresponsive to
   nitro, morphine, oxygen
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has evidence of both right and left sided heart
   failure, has both diastolic and systolic heart dysfunction.  EF 30% on
   TTE on [**2180-2-14**], acute decompensation that prompted this admissiion
   likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows elevated
   pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient with
   evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures), which is likely chronic, leading to RV diastolic
   dysfunction and peripheral congestion.  Her sx of SOB is likely
   secondary to heart failure.  PE is less likely given pt is ambulatory,
   no calf pain, no recent plain rides, no asymmetric LE exam.  CTA ruled
   out PE.   Pt received 40mg IV lasix x 2 yesterday am and pm, 60mg IV
   lasix at midnight (total of 140mg), approx -600cc balance over the past
   24h
   - continue BB, ACEI
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - continue lasix, with goal -1L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes while on diuresis
   - O2 as needed
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates that the interstitial abnormality in the left
   lung with sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  However, CT showed no evidence for it.  Her weight
   loss and decreased appetite could be due to related to heart failure
   and bowel congestion, especially given her elevated PA pressure.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - monitor pt on telemetry
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%
   - continue RISS
   - diabetic diet
   - blood sugar QID
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB, captopril
   - will uptitrate captopril and down-titrate hydralazine
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin
   .
   # UTI:  UA was positive on [**2-15**].  blood cx from [**Hospital3 **] grew out
   Coag neg staph, likely contamination.
   - continue cipro for 3 days for uncomplicated UTI
   - continue to trend WBC and fever
   .
   # Med non-compliance:
   - SW consult

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of CAD, NSTEMI, and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. She has been admitted to the ICU for management of her condition. Her cardiac enzymes are trending down, and she has been started on heparin, aspirin, and beta-blockers. She has also been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension and is awaiting CABG.

The patient has a positive urine culture for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, which was likely contamination. She has been started on ciprofloxacin for a uncomplicated UTI.

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds throughout the lung fields, prolonged expiratory phase, and mild crackles at the right base. Her peripheral vascular examination reveals a trace of LE edema, and her neurologic examination is grossly intact.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.6, hemoglobin of 12.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 306. Her troponin-T level is 0.87 ng/mL, and her creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Heart failure: The patient has evidence of both right and left-sided heart failure, which can lead to worsening of her condition if not managed properly.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension can worsen if not managed properly, leading to further cardiac dysfunction.
3. UTI: The patient has a positive urine culture for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, which can lead to a more severe infection if not treated promptly.
4. COPD: The patient's COPD can exacerbate her pulmonary hypertension and worsen her respiratory function.
5. Weight loss: The patient's unintentional weight loss of 30 pounds over the past 6 months may be due to related to heart failure, bowel congestion, or other underlying medical conditions.
6. Cancer: The patient's CXR shows an interstitial abnormality in the left lung with nodularity, which may be consistent with lymphangitic carcinomatosis. A colonoscopy is needed to rule out cancer.
7. Cardiac arrhythmia: The patient has a 1st-degree AV block on EKG, which may be due to decreased coronary supply to the AV node from RCA. Monitoring on telemetry is recommended.

Plan:

1. Continue heparin, aspirin, and beta-blockers for cardiac management.
2. Encourage smoking cessation and offer nicotine patches.
3. Continue ciprofloxacin for a uncomplicated UTI.
4. Manage heart failure with diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and beta-blockers.
5. Monitor the patient's pulmonary hypertension and consider further management with pulmonary hypertension medications.
6. Conduct a colonoscopy to rule out cancer.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiac arrhythmia and consider further management with cardiac medications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Transferred
   from OSH with NSTEMI, now down-trending cardiac enzymes. Given low CK,
   elevated troponin, and temporal symptoms x3 weeks, likely patient had
   acute ACS event a few weeks ago. Troponins are now down-trending.
   Patient had no anginal equivalent symptoms, which may be in the setting
   of diabetic neuropathy. Has 3VD on cardiac cath, with critical left
   main stenosis. Awaiting CABG.
   - continue ASA, BB, high dose statin, ACEI, heparin gtt
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - plavix washout for prior to CABG
   - f/u Csurg recs
   - may need carotid US as part of the pre-op eval
   - urgent surgery if chest pain / angina equivalent unresponsive to
   nitro, morphine, oxygen
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has evidence of both right and left sided heart
   failure, has both diastolic and systolic heart dysfunction.  EF 30% on
   TTE on [**2180-2-14**], acute decompensation that prompted this admissiion
   likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows elevated
   pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient with
   evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures), which is likely chronic, leading to RV diastolic
   dysfunction and peripheral congestion.  Her sx of SOB is likely
   secondary to heart failure.  PE is less likely given pt is ambulatory,
   no calf pain, no recent plain rides, no asymmetric LE exam.  CTA ruled
   out PE.   Pt received 40mg IV lasix x 2 yesterday am and pm, 60mg IV
   lasix at midnight (total of 140mg), approx -600cc balance over the past
   24h
   - continue BB, ACEI
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - lasix 40mg IV this am, with goal -1L to -1.5L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes while on diuresis
   - O2 as needed
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates that the interstitial abnormality in the left
   lung with sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  However, CT showed no evidence for it.  Her weight
   loss and decreased appetite could be due to related to heart failure
   and bowel congestion, especially given her elevated PA pressure.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - monitor pt on telemetry
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%
   - continue RISS
   - diabetic diet
   - blood sugar QID
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB, captopril
   - will uptitrate captopril and down-titrate hydralazine
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin
   .
   # UTI:  UA was positive on [**2-15**].  blood cx from [**Hospital3 **] grew out
   Coag neg staph, likely contamination.
   - continue cipro for 3 days for uncomplicated UTI
   - continue to trend WBC and fever
   .
   # Med non-compliance:
   - SW consult

   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates that the interstitial abnormality in the left
   lung with sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  However, CT showed no evidence for it.  Her weight
   loss and decreased appetite could be due to related to heart failure
   and bowel congestion, especially given her elevated PA pressure.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with known CAD, presenting with progressive dyspnea on exertion, NSTEMI, and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. She has known 3VD on cardiac cath and is awaiting CABG.

The patient has multiple risk factors for CAD, including DMII, HTN, HLD, and current smoking. She had a previous IMI with RCA BMS placement and was transferred from OSH with NSTEMI, now with down-trending cardiac enzymes.

The patient has evidence of both right and left-sided heart failure, with diastolic and systolic heart dysfunction, and an EF of 30% on TTE. She has pulmonary hypertension, likely chronic, leading to RV diastolic dysfunction and peripheral congestion.

The patient's symptoms of SOB are likely secondary to heart failure. PE is less likely given her ambulatory status, no calf pain, no recent plane rides, and no asymmetric LE exam. CTA ruled out PE.

The patient has a positive UA, and blood cultures from [**2-15**] grew out Coag neg staph, likely contamination.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Heart failure: The patient has acute decompensated congestive heart failure, which requires aggressive treatment to manage symptoms and prevent further deterioration.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has chronic pulmonary hypertension, which may worsen with elevated wedge pressure and require ongoing management.
3. UTI: The patient has a positive UA and may have a UTI, which requires antibiotic treatment and close monitoring of WBC and fever.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has decreased breath sounds throughout the lung fields, which may indicate pneumonia or COPD.
5. Cancer: The patient has a history of weight loss and decreased appetite, which may be related to an underlying malignancy.
6. Cardiac arrhythmia: The patient has 1' AV block on EKG, which may be due to decreased coronary supply to the AV node from RCA and requires ongoing monitoring and management.
7. Diabetes: The patient has DMII, which requires ongoing management with diet, medication, and blood sugar monitoring.
8. Hypertension: The patient has HTN, which requires ongoing management with medication and lifestyle modifications.
9. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient has known PVD, which may require ongoing management with medication and lifestyle modifications.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of these potential complications to prevent further deterioration and improve outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF). She presented with dyspnea on exertion and was found to have a subacute non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with critical left main stenosis. She is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. She is currently on various medications, including aspirin, beta-blockers, high-dose statins, and heparin.

Physical examination reveals signs of right pleural effusion, and the patient is experiencing mild venous stasis at her ankles. Laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, and the patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block.

The patient's condition is being managed with diuretics, oxygen therapy, and cardiotonic medications. She is also receiving prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac condition is unstable, and she is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary hypertension. She is at risk for respiratory failure, pneumonia, and respiratory arrest.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is at risk due to her cardiac condition, and she may experience neurological symptoms such as confusion, weakness, or loss of consciousness.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastrointestinal status is at risk due to her cardiac condition, and she may experience nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
5. Infectious complications: The patient is at risk for infectious complications, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and sepsis, due to her compromised immune system and presence of indwelling catheters.
6. Nutritional complications: The patient's nutritional status is at risk due to her cardiac condition, and she may experience malnutrition, dehydration, or electrolyte imbalances.
7. Medication-related complications: The patient is taking multiple medications, and she is at risk for medication-related complications, such as adverse reactions, interactions, and non-compliance.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

   likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows elevated
   pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient with
   evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures), which is likely chronic, leading to RV diastolic

   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF). She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and was found to have a subacute non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with downtrending troponins. She is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for 3-vessel disease and critical left main stenosis.

The patient has multiple risk factors for CAD, including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and current smoking. She has a history of ischemia, with a recent episode of inferior myocardial infarction (IMI) and placement of a right coronary artery bare metal stent (BMS).

The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, but diminished throughout and absent at bases bilaterally, suggesting right pleural effusion. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) shows a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, with a peak of 0.87 ng/mL. Her hemoglobin (Hb) level is 13.5 g/dL, and her hematocrit (Hct) is 40.1%. Her platelet count is 317 K/uL.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continued beta-blocker therapy
* Low sodium diet and fluid restriction
* Decreased Lasix drip to 2.5/hr with goal of -2L daily
* Weaning of oxygen as tolerated
* Repeat chest X-ray (CXR) today pre-op and assess for changes in fluid status

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's CHF and elevated pulmonary wedge pressures increase the risk of pulmonary edema.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with diminished breath sounds and prolonged expiratory phase, which may lead to respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's first-degree AV block and history of ischemia increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and history of bleeding complications increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Infection: The patient's UTI and history of smoking increase the risk of infection.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's cardiac and diabetic diet, as well as her history of malnutrition, increase the risk of malnutrition.
7. Worsening of CAD: The patient's history of CAD and recent ischemia increase the risk of worsening CAD.

These potential complications will be closely monitored and managed by the healthcare team to ensure the patient's safety and optimal outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-inch tall, 54.7 kg individual with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), type II, and heart failure (CHF), acute on chronic. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to dyspnea on exertion.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 57 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 133/63 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula, with a saturation level of 94%.

The patient has undergone various tests, including an echocardiogram, which showed a right pleural effusion. The patient is also receiving treatment for heart failure, including furosemide (Lasix) and heparin sodium.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating myocardial injury. The patient's glucose levels are also elevated, indicating hyperglycemia.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the risk of developing pneumonia is still present, especially given the patient's history of CAD and CHF.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of CAD and CHF increases the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
4. Pulmonary edema: The patient's history of CHF and the presence of a right pleural effusion may indicate the development of pulmonary edema.
5. Kidney damage: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels may indicate kidney damage or failure.
6. Infection: The patient's history of DM and CHF increases the risk of developing infections, such as urinary tract infections or skin infections.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of CAD and CHF increases the risk of developing respiratory failure, especially if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates.
8. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's history of CAD and CHF increases the risk of developing cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening condition that occurs when fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure the patient's optimal care."

   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient with subacute NSTEMI (without anginal symptoms)
   now with downtrending Troponins, awaiting CABG for 3VD & critical left
   main stenosis. Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Carotid U/S
   performed on [**2-16**] preliminary read was 40% stenoses bilaterally. Patient
   stable since admission, but de-sating with ambulation, so will remain
   in CCU until surgery.
   - F/U final read of carotid U/S
   - continue ASA, BB, high dose statin, ACEI, heparin gtt
   - plavix washout for prior to CABG
   - f/u Csurg recs
   - urgent surgery if chest pain / angina equivalent unresponsive to
   nitro, morphine, oxygen
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has evidence of both right and left sided heart
   failure, has both diastolic and systolic heart dysfunction.  EF 30% on
   TTE on [**2180-2-14**], acute decompensation that prompted this admissiion
   likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows elevated
   pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient with
   evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures), which is likely chronic, leading to RV diastolic
   dysfunction and peripheral congestion.  Her sx of SOB is likely
   secondary to heart failure.   CTA ruled out PE.
   - continue BB, ACEI
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - continue lasix gtt at 5/hr with goal -1L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes while on diuresis
   - O2 as needed
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates interstitial abnormality in the left lung with
   sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  However, CT showed no evidence for it.  Her weight
   loss and decreased appetite could be due to related to heart failure
   and bowel congestion, especially given her elevated PA pressure.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - on telemetry

   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%
   - continue RISS
   - diabetic diet
   - blood sugar QACHS

   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB
   - Captopril at 25mg PO TID
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin
   .
   # UTI:  UA was positive on [**2-15**].  blood cx from [**Hospital3 **] grew out
   Coag neg staph, likely contamination.
   - continue cipro for 3 days for uncomplicated UTI, day [**3-15**]
   - continue to trend WBC and fever

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral vascular disease. She is currently admitted to the ICU with acute decompensated congestive heart failure, NSTEMI, and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient has undergone a cardiac catheterization, which revealed 3-vessel disease with critical left main stenosis. She is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Dyspnea on exertion
* Right pleural effusion
* Mild venous stasis at ankles bilaterally
* Edema in the right lower extremity
* Decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged expiratory phase
* Elevated pulmonary arterial pressures
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
* Weight loss of 30 pounds over the past 6 months

The patient is receiving the following treatments:

* Heparin sodium infusion
* Furosemide (Lasix) infusion
* Aspirin
* Beta-blocker
* High-dose statin
* ACE inhibitor
* Plavix washout for prior to CABG
* Cipro for uncomplicated UTI
* Insulin sliding scale for glycemic control

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac tamponade due to the patient's right pleural effusion
* Pulmonary edema due to the patient's acute decompensated congestive heart failure
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's COPD and pulmonary hypertension
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to the patient's immobility and history of peripheral vascular disease
* Stress ulcer due to the patient's acute illness and medications
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation
* Poor wound healing due to the patient's history of smoking and peripheral vascular disease

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated troponin levels
* Elevated creatinine levels
* Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels
* Anemia
* Leukocytosis
* Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels

The patient's medication regimen includes:

* Aspirin
* Beta-blocker
* High-dose statin
* ACE inhibitor
* Plavix
* Furosemide (Lasix)
* Heparin sodium
* Cipro
* Insulin sliding scale

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued treatment for acute decompensated congestive heart failure
* Aggressive treatment of pulmonary hypertension
* Smoking cessation counseling
* Colonoscopy to work up the patient's weight loss
* Outpatient pulmonary function tests (PFTs) to assess the patient's lung function
* Follow-up with the patient's primary care physician to monitor her condition and adjust her medication regimen as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting CABG.  She was taken to the OR and
   therefore off of the CCU service on [**2180-2-18**]. She has several issues;
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient with subacute NSTEMI (without anginal symptoms)
   now with downtrending Troponins, awaiting CABG for 3VD & critical left
   main stenosis. Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Carotid U/S
   performed on [**2-16**] preliminary read was 40% stenoses bilaterally. Patient
   stable since admission, but de-sating with ambulation, so will remain
   in CCU until surgery.
   - To OR today
   - continue ASA, BB, high dose statin, ACEI, heparin gtt
   - patient given smoking cessation information by SW
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has evidence of both right and left sided heart
   failure, has both diastolic and systolic heart dysfunction.  EF 30% on
   TTE on [**2180-2-14**], acute decompensation that prompted this admissiion
   likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows elevated
   pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient with
   evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures), which is likely chronic, leading to RV diastolic
   dysfunction and peripheral congestion. Serial CXR and physical exams
   show significant right effusiom  Her sx of SOB is likely secondary to
   heart failure.   CTA ruled out PE.
   - continue BB, ACEI
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - continue diuresis
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes while on diuresis
   - wean O2 as tolerates; patient may need home 02, reassess post-op
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates interstitial abnormality in the left lung with
   sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  However, CT showed no evidence for it.  Her weight
   loss and decreased appetite could be due to related to heart failure
   and bowel congestion, especially given her elevated PA pressure.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   - communicate these plans to CSURG team
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%. Patient not
   likely to benefit from intensive glucose control. However, needs better
   control than currently managing.
   - continue RISS in house
   - diabetic diet
   - blood sugar QACHS
   - restart metformin outpatient
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - on telemetry
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB
   - Captopril at 25mg PO TID
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin
   .
   # UTI:  UA was positive on [**2-15**].  blood cx from [**Hospital3 **] grew out
   Coag neg staph, likely contamination.
   - continue cipro for 3 days for uncomplicated UTI, day [**3-15**]
   - continue to trend WBC and fever
   .
   # Med non-compliance:
   - SW consult
   .
   # Smoking cessation:
   -          offered nicotine patch, pt refused. Offer again
   -          motivated to quit per SW consult

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion, NSTEMI, and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. She has undergone cardiac catheterization and is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient has multiple risk factors for CAD, including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and current smoking. She has also been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and peripheral vascular disease.

Medical Complications:

1. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has significant CAD, with 3-vessel disease and critical left main stenosis, which is a high-risk condition.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has both systolic and diastolic heart failure, with an estimated ejection fraction of 30% on echocardiogram. She has elevated pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.
3. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has pulmonary hypertension, which may be secondary to COPD, cor pulmonale from malignancy, or chronic lung disease.
4. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient has COPD, which may contribute to her pulmonary hypertension and dyspnea.
5. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient has peripheral vascular disease, which may be contributing to her symptoms of exertional calf claudication.
6. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a history of UTI, which may be complicated by her underlying medical conditions.
7. Med Non-Compliance: The patient has a history of non-compliance with her medications, which may be contributing to her ongoing symptoms.
8. Smoking Cessation: The patient is a current smoker and has been offered nicotine patches, which she has refused.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's CAD and heart failure increase her risk of cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's COPD and pulmonary hypertension may increase her risk of respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's UTI and underlying medical conditions may increase her risk of sepsis.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and underlying medical conditions may increase her risk of DVT.
5. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's pulmonary hypertension and immobility may increase her risk of PE.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's heart failure and underlying medical conditions may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Renal Failure: The patient's heart failure and underlying medical conditions may increase her risk of renal failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue aggressive treatment of heart failure, including diuresis and beta-blockers.
2. Continue smoking cessation efforts, including offering nicotine patches and counseling.
3. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust her diabetes management plan as necessary.
4. Continue prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her oxygen therapy as necessary.
6. Consider consulting a pulmonologist for further management of the patient's pulmonary hypertension and COPD.
7. Consider referring the patient to a smoking cessation program."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-inch, 59-kg male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. He has a history of coronary artery disease, type II diabetes, and chronic systolic heart failure. He underwent a carotid ultrasound, which showed right and left internal carotid artery stenosis less than 40%. He was started on heparin sodium infusion and furosemide (Lasix) infusion. He had a Foley catheter inserted, which was later removed due to hematuria and Foley trauma. He was also seen by anesthesia and underwent surgery the next day.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure of 139/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. His laboratory results show mild anemia, elevated blood glucose, and slightly elevated troponin-T levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease and acute on chronic heart failure, there is a risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) increase the risk of respiratory complications such as respiratory failure, pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
3. Renal complications: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI) increase the risk of renal complications such as acute tubular necrosis (ATN), chronic kidney disease progression, or end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
4. Infection: The patient's history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease increases the risk of infection, particularly urinary tract infections (UTIs) or sepsis.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and diabetes increases the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, constipation, or diarrhea.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and diabetes increases the risk of neurological complications such as stroke, seizures, or peripheral neuropathy.
7. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and diabetes increases the risk of hemorrhagic complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, or hemoptysis.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to prevent or early detect these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting CABG.  She was taken to the OR and
   therefore off of the CCU service on [**2180-2-18**]. She has several issues;
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient with subacute NSTEMI (without anginal symptoms)
   now with downtrending Troponins, awaiting CABG for 3VD & critical left
   main stenosis. Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Carotid U/S
   performed on [**2-16**] preliminary read was 40% stenoses bilaterally. Patient
   stable since admission, but de-sating with ambulation, so will remain
   in CCU until surgery.
   - To OR today
   - continue ASA, BB, high dose statin, ACEI, heparin gtt
   - patient given smoking cessation information by SW
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has evidence of both right and left sided heart
   failure, has both diastolic and systolic heart dysfunction.  EF 30% on
   TTE on [**2180-2-14**], acute decompensation that prompted this admissiion
   likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows elevated
   pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient with
   evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures), which is likely chronic, leading to RV diastolic
   dysfunction and peripheral congestion. Serial CXR and physical exams
   show significant right effusiom  Her sx of SOB is likely secondary to
   heart failure.   CTA ruled out PE.
   - continue BB, ACEI
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - continue diuresis
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes while on diuresis
   - wean O2 as tolerates; patient may need home 02, reassess post-op
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates interstitial abnormality in the left lung with
   sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  However, CT showed no evidence for it.  Her weight
   loss and decreased appetite could be due to related to heart failure
   and bowel congestion, especially given her elevated PA pressure.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   - communicate these plans to CSURG team
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%. Patient not
   likely to benefit from intensive glucose control. However, needs better
   control than currently managing.
   - continue RISS in house
   - diabetic diet
   - blood sugar QACHS
   - restart metformin outpatient
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - on telemetry
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB
   - Captopril at 25mg PO TID
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin
   .
   # UTI:  UA was positive on [**2-15**].  blood cx from [**Hospital3 **] grew out
   Coag neg staph, likely contamination.
   - continue cipro for 3 days for uncomplicated UTI, day [**3-15**]
   - continue to trend WBC and fever
   .
   # Med non-compliance:
   - SW consult
   .
   # Smoking cessation:
   -          offered nicotine patch, pt refused. Offer again
   -          motivated to quit per SW consult

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

	* High risk of cardiac arrhythmias due to ischemia and decreased coronary supply to the AV node.
	* Potential for cardiac tamponade or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) during surgery.
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to pulmonary edema and decreased lung compliance.
	* Hypoxemia and hypercapnia due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary hypertension.
	* Risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute respiratory failure.
3. Renal complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypovolemia, nephrotoxic medications, and decreased renal perfusion.
	* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) exacerbation due to hypertension, diabetes, and cardiac disease.
4. Neurological complications:
	* Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) due to carotid stenosis and decreased cerebral blood flow.
	* Seizures or altered mental status due to electrolyte imbalances, hypoxia, or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Infection complications:
	* Urinary tract infection (UTI) due to indwelling urinary catheter and decreased immune function.
	* Sepsis or septic shock due to bacteremia or pneumonia.
6. Metabolic complications:
	* Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia due to diabetes and medication adjustments.
	* Electrolyte imbalances due to diuresis, hypovolemia, and medication interactions.
7. Surgical complications:
	* Cardiac surgery-related complications, such as bleeding, arrhythmias, or cardiac tamponade.
	* Respiratory or renal complications due to anesthesia and surgical stress.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent and treat them promptly."
