   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - HD early in afternoon.
   - IR procedure at 16:00 interupted HD
   - IR drained thick purulent fluid and placed drain
   - Hypoglycemic after IR procedure to 9 by fingerstick on returning to
   the floor. Pushed 25 g dextrose with recovery. Given juice.
   - Hepatology: Do not use G-tube. Continue antibiotic Rx. [**Month (only) 11**] have
   previously underestimated degree of liver failure. Could be stage IV.
   - Somnolent most of the day.
   - Occasional PVCs on telemetry.
   - WBC climbing - 23.9 > 38.4 > 39.2. Suspicion for C. diff. given
   diarrhea, also other infections: sepsis, abdominal wall. HD stable
   overnight and afebrile.
   - Some loose stool in the evening - partly dried on mat and not send
   for C. diff.
   - Started on empiric enteral vancomycin given no stool sent and WBC
   climbing.
   - Refused dailysis this a.m. (Renal would like to have done this this
   morning because she really had very little fluid off last session).
   - Started stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone 25 mg Q8H IV).

   Assessment and Plan
   48F with Hep B, DM, malnutrition s/p recent PEG placement, presenting
   with abdominal pain and malaise, found to have nonketotic hyperglycemia
   and concern for abdominal wall abscess.
   .
   # Abdominal wall ?abscess.  In setting of recent PEG placement [**1-6**] by
   GI.  Mutiple gas pockets concerning for abscess.  Appears to be all
   within anterior abdominal wall; no evidence of collection
   intraperitoneally.  Radiology has reviewed; willing to attempt
   drainage.  Awaiting formal GI and surgical input (if GI has opinion on
   [**Doctor First Name **] vs. IR management).
   - NPO and nothing through PEG tube.
   - GI made aware and will see patient.
   - Appreciate gen [**Doctor First Name **] input.
   - Decision re: IR/rads drainage vs. surgical drainage after discussion
   with all teams.
   - Vanco/zosyn for antibiotics.  Further tailoring antibiotics based on
   abscess drainage results.
   - Low threshold for stress dose steroids given prolonged steroid
   course.
   - Glucose control in setting of infection as below.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia/DM.  Likely due to severity of infection and
   inflammatory state.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be contribution from now improved
   nutrition with PEG tube.  Outpatient insulin doses unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 83**] current
   evidence of ketones in serum or urine currently, though has had anion
   gap. A
   - Check serum ketones here (and UA if voids again).
   - Obtain home doses of insulin from family and/or pharmacy.
   - Insulin gtt likely for today given profound hyperglycemia and desire
   to acheive relatively good glucose control with current infection.
   Consider SQ dose later today if control improves.
   - Monitor K closely with insulin treatment (ESRD but may be K depleted
   from urinary losses, as does produce urine).
   - Hold off on further fluids for now (not volume depleted by exam and
   somewhat protected from usual osmotic diuresis due to ESRD) but low
   threshold to start.
   .
   # UTI. Positive UA at OSH.
   - Resend urine here.
   - Call OSH tomorrow for UCx results.
   - Coverage with vanc/zosyn.
   .
   # Lethargy.  Improving as day goes on.  At baseline lives at home but
   requires signficant help from daughter and [**Name (NI) **]; does not due own tube
   feeds.  Concern for ?depression with last admit.  Also was overnight
   admit, may just be sleep deprived.  Nothing focal (other than chronic
   deficits) on neuro exam.  Most likely systemic effects of infection;
   much less likely primary CNS insult (stroke, bleed, meningitis).
   - Continue to monitor.
   - Consider head CT, LP in light of leukocytosis, but again other
   etiologies more likely.
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis.  Elevated bicarb at OSH on VBG -
   ?chronic CO2 retention.  Bicarb now 28 with AG 16 (worse than looks
   with likely low albumin).  Renal failure vs. lactate vs. ketones
   (though no evidence of ketones thus far).
   - Check serum acetone.
   - Check lactate.
   .
   # ESRD.  Usual HD M/W/F at [**Hospital1 97**] via R tunnelled line.
   - Renal aware; likely no acute indication for HD today provided K stays
   low.
   .
   # Anemia.  Concern for GIB at OSH.  Stools guiaiac pos but brown;
   gastrocult positive from PEG tube.  Had 4 point Hct drop compared to
   last known values, but with appropriate bump to OSH transfusion
   - Defer to GI re: decisions to potentially scope.
   .
   # Chronic hep B infection/cholangiopathy.  Bili slightly up above
   baseline.
   - Hold entecavir/tenofovir given reluctancy to use PEG right now.
   - Obtain accurate home med list.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.  Concern for infection/abscess as above.
   - Treatment of abscess as above.
   - Consider flagyl or rule out C.diff (though diarrhea longstanding).
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO and nothing thru PEG
   # Prophylaxis: Hold SQH for now (monitor PTT if starting)
   # Access: peripherals, HD line
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement, off insulin gtt

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis B, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, and recent PEG placement, presenting with abdominal pain and malaise.
* She has a non-ketotic hyperglycemia and concern for abdominal wall abscess.
* She has a polymicrobial infection (Gram-positive and Gram-negative rods, and budding yeast) and is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.
* She has a high white blood cell count (WBC) and is suspected to have sepsis, abdominal wall abscess, and C. diff infection.
* She is receiving stress dose steroids due to prolonged steroid course.
* She has an anion gap metabolic acidosis, elevated bicarbonate, and is at risk for hyperkalemia.
* She has chronic liver disease and cholangiopathy.
* She has chronic kidney disease and is on hemodialysis three times a week.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Sepsis and septic shock due to polymicrobial infection
* Abdominal wall abscess rupture and peritonitis
* C. diff colitis
* Hyperkalemia due to kidney disease and insulin treatment
* Anion gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis
* Lactic acidosis due to sepsis and liver disease
* Hepatic encephalopathy due to liver disease
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to chronic liver disease and PEG placement
* Renal failure due to kidney disease and sepsis
* Electrolyte imbalance due to kidney disease and sepsis

**Assessment and Plan:**

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and clinical condition.
* Continue treatment for polymicrobial infection, C. diff infection, and sepsis.
* Monitor glucose control and adjust insulin treatment as needed.
* Monitor potassium levels and adjust treatment accordingly.
* Consider stress dose steroids to prevent adrenal insufficiency.
* Consider head CT and LP to rule out primary CNS insult.
* Continue to monitor for signs of abdominal wall abscess rupture and peritonitis.
* Consider surgical drainage of abscess if conservative management fails.
* Continue to monitor for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and consider endoscopy if necessary.
* Continue to monitor for signs of renal failure and consider dialysis if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis B, Diabetes Mellitus, and malnutrition who was admitted with abdominal pain and malaise. The patient had a PEG placement recently and was found to have nonketotic hyperglycemia and concern for an abdominal wall abscess.

The patient underwent an IR procedure to drain the abscess, which yielded purulent fluid with a Gram stain showing Gram-positive rods, Gram-negative rods, and budding yeast. The patient was started on empiric enteral vancomycin and Zosyn antibiotics.

The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, and there is suspicion of C. diff infection. The patient is also experiencing hypoglycemia and is on insulin therapy. The patient has a history of chronic Hepatitis B infection and cholangiopathy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Worsening of the abdominal wall abscess, leading to sepsis and organ failure.
2. Development of C. diff colitis, which can lead to severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Hypoglycemia, which can lead to neurological deficits, seizures, and even death if left untreated.
4. Infection of the PEG tube, which can lead to peritonitis and abscess formation.
5. Development of liver failure, which can lead to coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and death.
6. Renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and death.
7. Respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and death.
8. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and heart failure, which can arise from the patient's underlying medical conditions.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   48F with Hep B, DM, malnutrition s/p recent PEG placement, presenting
   with abdominal pain and malaise, found to have nonketotic hyperglycemia
   and concern for abdominal wall abscess.
   .
   # Abdominal wall Abscess.  IR drained purulent fluid. Gram Stain with
   GPR, GNR, Yeast. Unclear if PEG tube integrity still intact. Patient
   improving clinically despite increasing white blood cell count.
   Hemodynamically stable. Discussed treating yeast with ID they recommend
   Micafungin if patient clinically decompensates, however may be from GI
   tract.
   - NPO and nothing through PEG tube currently.
   - FU GI Recs
   - Follow abdominal exam/JP drain input
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need gastrograffin study at some point to evaluate PEG tube.
   - Vanco/zosyn for antibiotics.  Further tailoring antibiotics based on
   abscess drainage results.
   - Decrease stress dose steroids to normal level.
   - Glucose control in setting of infection as below.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.  Concern for infection/abscess as above. White count
   increasing.
   - Treatment of abscess as above.
   - IV flagyl for empiric treatment of C. Diff.
   .
   # DM.  Pt on Insulin gtt early yesterday. Hypoglycemic after IR
   procedure. Subcutaneous insulin restarted. AG closed.
   - Glargine at half dose and SSI, fingerstick Q6hrs
   - Nutrition as soon as possible, discuss with GI
   .
   # UTI. No Urine
   - Resend urine
   - Coverage with vanc/zosyn.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a complex medical history, including hepatitis B, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, and a recent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She presented with abdominal pain and malaise, and was found to have nonketotic hyperglycemia and a concern for an abdominal wall abscess.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamically stable
* Increasing white blood cell count (WBC) with suspicion for infection/abscess
* Abdominal wall abscess drained by interventional radiology (IR) with Gram stain showing polymorphonuclear leukocytes, gram-positive rods, and budding yeast
* Unclear if PEG tube integrity is still intact
* Patient improving clinically despite increasing WBC count
* Currently NPO and not receiving anything through the PEG tube
* Receiving empiric antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) and stress dose steroids
* Hypoglycemic episode after IR procedure, with subcutaneous insulin restarted
* Lethargic, but improving with minimal asterixis on exam
* No urine output, with plans to resend urine and cover with antibiotics
* ESRD patient, with usual HD schedule on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
* Anemia patient, with concern for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB)
* Chronic hepatitis B infection/cholangiopathy, with bilirubin slightly elevated above baseline

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to the abdominal wall abscess and increasing WBC count
* Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to the anemia and potential damage to the gastrointestinal tract
* Hepatic encephalopathy due to the chronic hepatitis B infection and cholangiopathy
* Renal failure due to the ESRD and potential complications from the HD schedule
* Infection and abscess formation at the PEG tube site, which could lead to further complications and potentially life-threatening outcomes.

Based on the patient's condition and medical history, it is crucial to continue monitoring her closely and adjusting her treatment plan as needed to prevent these potential complications and ensure her overall well-being."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old woman with a history of chronic hepatitis B, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and type II diabetes mellitus (DM). She was admitted to the ICU for suspected infection and fluid collection associated with a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement for malnutrition. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Abdominal wall infection with evidence of polymicrobial infection by initial gram stain.
* Elevated white blood cell count, but clinically appearing better after IR drainage.
* Wound infection with a pending wound culture.
* Refusal of hemodialysis (HD) treatment this morning.
* Hyperglycemia resolved with an episode of hypoglycemia last night, requiring D50 treatment.
* Restarting subcutaneous insulin and discontinuing insulin drip.
* Other issues include altered nutrition, impaired skin integrity, impaired health maintenance, knowledge deficit, and renal failure.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Wound infection progression, leading to sepsis or organ failure.
* Development of Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection due to antibiotic use.
* Hyperglycemia recurrence, potentially leading to diabetic ketoacidosis or non-ketotic hyperosmolar coma.
* Renal failure progression, potentially leading to uremic syndrome or acute kidney injury.
* Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to prolonged ICU stay.
* Cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest, due to underlying comorbidities or medication use.
* Neurological complications, such as seizures or encephalopathy, due to underlying comorbidities, medication use, or sepsis.

The patient's plan of care includes continued antibiotic therapy, wound care, and close monitoring of her condition. The healthcare team should closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent or manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   48F with Hep B, DM, malnutrition s/p recent PEG placement, presenting
   with abdominal pain and malaise, found to have nonketotic hyperglycemia
   and concern for abdominal wall abscess.
   .
   # Abdominal wall Abscess.  IR drained purulent fluid. Gram Stain with
   GPR, GNR, Yeast. Unclear if PEG tube integrity still intact. Patient
   improving clinically despite increasing white blood cell count.
   Hemodynamically stable. Discussed treating yeast with ID they recommend
   Micafungin if patient clinically decompensates, however may be from GI
   tract.
   - NPO and nothing through PEG tube currently.
   - FU GI Recs
   - Follow abdominal exam/JP drain input
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need gastrograffin study at some point to evaluate PEG tube.
   - Vanco/zosyn/micofungin for antibiotics.  Further tailoring
   antibiotics based on abscess drainage results.
   - Decrease stress dose steroids to normal level.
   - Glucose control in setting of infection as below.
   .
   # Fungemia. Likely from GI tract as source. Continue treatment as
   above.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.  Concern for infection/abscess as above. White count
   increasing.
   - Treatment of abscess as above.
   - IV flagyl for empiric treatment of C. Diff.
   .
   # DM.  Pt on Insulin gtt early yesterday. Hypoglycemic after IR
   procedure. Subcutaneous insulin restarted. AG closed.
   - Glargine at half dose and SSI, fingerstick Q6hrs
   - Nutrition as soon as possible, discuss with GI
   .
   # UTI. No Urine
   - Resend urine
   - Coverage with vanc/zosyn.
   .
   # Lethargy.  Improved. Alert and Oriented x 3. Minimal asterixis on
   exam.
   - Continue to monitor.
   - When taking PO start Lactulose.
   .
   # ESRD.  Usual HD M/W/F at [**Hospital1 97**] via R tunnelled line.
   - FU renal recs
   - Dialysis today.
   .
   # Anemia.  Concern for GIB at OSH.  Stools Guaiac positive but brown.
   HCT stable.
   - Continue to Guaiac stools
   - Defer to GI re: decisions to potentially scope.
   .
   # Chronic hep B infection/cholangiopathy.  Bili slightly up above
   baseline.
   - Hold entecavir/tenofovir given reluctancy to use PEG right now.
   - Obtain accurate home med list.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO and nothing thru PEG
   # Prophylaxis: Hold SQH for now (monitor PTT if starting)
   # Access: peripherals, HD line
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement, off insulin gtt

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a complex medical history, including Hepatitis B, diabetes mellitus, and malnutrition. She was admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain, malaise, and concern for an abdominal wall abscess.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 133/63 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 6 inspirations per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 99%.

The patient's physical examination reveals a lethargic mental status, with slowed and quiet speech. Her HEENT examination is normal, with no obvious facial droop or signs of increased intracranial pressure. Her lung examination is clear to auscultation, with no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Her cardiovascular examination reveals a regular rate and rhythm, with a normal S1 and S2, and a loud holosystolic murmur throughout the precordium. Her abdominal examination reveals a small amount of dried blood at the PEG site, with moderate tenderness to palpation on the left side, and guarding.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 26.7 x 10^9/L, with a neutrophil count of 86.5%. Her platelet count is 390 x 10^9/L, and her hemoglobin level is 8.2 g/dL. Her liver function tests are elevated, with an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 32 U/L and an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 109 U/L. Her blood cultures are pending, but a preliminary result shows yeast.

The patient has been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and micafungin. She has also been treated with IV flagyl for empiric treatment of Clostridium difficile.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and yeast in her blood cultures may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Abdominal wall abscess: The patient's abdominal examination reveals tenderness and guarding, which may indicate an abdominal wall abscess. If the abscess is not drained, it may lead to further complications, including sepsis and organ failure.
3. Fungemia: The patient's blood cultures show yeast, which may indicate fungemia. If left untreated, fungemia can lead to disseminated fungal infection and organ failure.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's elevated liver function tests and stool guaiac positivity may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding. If left untreated, gastrointestinal bleeding can lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure.
5. Renal failure: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels may indicate renal failure. If left untreated, renal failure can lead to electrolyte imbalance, acidosis, and organ failure.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels may indicate electrolyte imbalance. If left untreated, electrolyte imbalance can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and organ failure.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to monitor her closely and adjust her treatment plan as necessary to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis B, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, and recent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She presented with abdominal pain and malaise and was found to have a nonketotic hyperglycemia and concern for an abdominal wall abscess. The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, and she has developed a yeast infection (fungemia) likely from the gastrointestinal tract. She is receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin, zosyn, and micafungin, and is being treated for an abdominal wall abscess.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's increasing white blood cell count and presence of yeast in her blood culture suggest a high risk of developing sepsis.
2. Abscess Recurrence: The patient's abdominal wall abscess was drained, but it is unclear if the PEG tube is still intact. There is a risk of abscess recurrence if the tube is not functioning properly.
3. Fungemia: The patient's fungemia is likely related to the gastrointestinal tract and may not respond to treatment.
4. Infection-Related Complications: The patient's increasing white blood cell count and presence of yeast in her blood culture suggest a high risk of developing infection-related complications, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition may worsen if she is unable to eat or absorb nutrients properly.
6. Diabetic Complications: The patient's diabetes mellitus may worsen if her blood sugar levels are not controlled properly.
7. Hepatitis B Flare: The patient's chronic hepatitis B infection may worsen if her liver function is not monitored closely.
8. Kidney Injury: The patient's kidney function may worsen if she develops sepsis or other complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's white blood cell count and blood cultures to ensure that the infection is responding to treatment.
2. Ensure that the PEG tube is functioning properly and that the patient is able to eat and absorb nutrients properly.
3. Monitor the patient's blood sugar levels closely and adjust her insulin regimen as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's liver function closely and adjust her antiviral therapy as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's kidney function closely and adjust her dialysis regimen as needed.
6. Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist to discuss the patient's nutritional needs and potential for enteral nutrition.
7. Consider consulting with an infectious disease specialist to discuss the patient's fungemia and potential for antifungal therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   48F with Hep B, DM, malnutrition s/p recent PEG placement, presenting
   with abdominal pain and malaise, found to have nonketotic hyperglycemia
   and concern for abdominal wall abscess.
   .
   # Abdominal wall Abscess.  IR drained purulent fluid. Gram Stain with
   GPR, GNR, Yeast. Unclear if PEG tube integrity still intact. Patient
   improving clinically despite increasing white blood cell count.
   Hemodynamically stable. Discussed treating yeast with ID they recommend
   Micafungin if patient clinically decompensates, however may be from GI
   tract.
   - NPO and nothing through PEG tube currently.
   - FU GI Recs
   - Follow abdominal exam/JP drain input
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need gastrograffin study at some point to evaluate PEG tube.
   - Vanco/zosyn/micofungin for antibiotics.  Further tailoring
   antibiotics based on abscess drainage results.
   - Decrease stress dose steroids to normal level.
   - Glucose control in setting of infection as below.
   .
   # Fungemia. Likely from GI tract as source. Continue treatment as
   above.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.  Concern for infection/abscess as above. White count
   increasing.
   - Treatment of abscess as above.
   - IV flagyl for empiric treatment of C. Diff.
   .
   # DM.  Pt on Insulin gtt early yesterday. Hypoglycemic after IR
   procedure. Subcutaneous insulin restarted. AG closed.
   - Glargine at half dose and SSI, fingerstick Q6hrs
   - Nutrition as soon as possible, discuss with GI
   .
   # UTI. No Urine
   - Resend urine
   - Coverage with vanc/zosyn.
   .
   # Lethargy.  Improved. Alert and Oriented x 3. Minimal asterixis on
   exam.
   - Continue to monitor.
   - When taking PO start Lactulose.
   .
   # ESRD.  Usual HD M/W/F at [**Hospital1 97**] via R tunnelled line.
   - FU renal recs
   - Dialysis today.
   .
   # Anemia.  Concern for GIB at OSH.  Stools Guaiac positive but brown.
   HCT stable.
   - Continue to Guaiac stools
   - Defer to GI re: decisions to potentially scope.
   .
   # Chronic hep B infection/cholangiopathy.  Bili slightly up above
   baseline.
   - Hold entecavir/tenofovir given reluctancy to use PEG right now.
   - Obtain accurate home med list.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO and nothing thru PEG
   # Prophylaxis: Hold SQH for now (monitor PTT if starting)

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis B, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, and recent PEG tube placement. She presented with abdominal pain and malaise, and was found to have non-ketotic hyperglycemia and concern for an abdominal wall abscess.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T: 37.8°C, HR: 83 bpm, BP: 134/65 mmHg, RR: 22 breaths/min, SpO2: 99%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Stable
* Fluid balance: +740 mL (total in) and -520 mL (total out) over the past 24 hours
* Respiratory support: None
* Physical examination: Lungs clear, abdomen soft with bowel sounds present, skin with PEG in place and JP drain
* Neurologic examination: Responds to commands, oriented x3, movement purposeful, tone normal

The patient has several medical complications, including:

* Abdominal wall abscess: Drained by IR with purulent fluid, Gram stain showing GPR, GNR, and yeast
* Fungemia: Likely from GI tract as source, being treated with Micafungin
* Leukocytosis: Concern for infection/abscess, white count increasing
* DM: On insulin gtt, hypoglycemic after IR procedure, subcutaneous insulin restarted
* UTI: No urine output, coverage with Vancomycin/Zosyn
* Lethargy: Improved, alert and oriented x3, minimal asterixis on exam
* ESRD: Usual HD M/W/F, dialysis today
* Anemia: Concern for GIB, HCT stable
* Chronic Hepatitis B infection/cholangiopathy: Bili slightly up above baseline, hold entecavir/tenofovir

The patient's plan includes:

* NPO and nothing through PEG tube currently
* FU GI Recs
* Follow abdominal exam/JP drain input
* [Month 11] need gastrograffin study at some point to evaluate PEG tube
* Vanco/Zosyn/Micafungin for antibiotics
* Decrease stress dose steroids to normal level
* Glucose control in setting of infection as below
* Continue treatment of abscess as above
* IV Flagyl for empiric treatment of C. Diff
* Restart subcutaneous insulin and SSI
* Nutrition as soon as possible, discuss with GI
* Resend urine and cover with Vancomycin/Zosyn
* Continue to monitor lethargy and start Lactulose when taking PO
* Usual HD M/W/F and dialysis today
* Continue to Guaiac stools and defer to GI re: decisions to potentially scope
* Hold entecavir/tenofovir and obtain accurate home med list

Overall, the patient is hemodynamically stable, but has several medical complications that require close monitoring and treatment."
