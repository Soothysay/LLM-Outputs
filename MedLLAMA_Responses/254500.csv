   Assessment and Plan
 CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
   77yo gentleman with CAD, HTN, and DM presenting with RUQ pain and
   obstructive LFTs concerning for cholangitis.
   # RUQ pain / Elevated LFTs:
   Clinical presentation concerning for cholangitis, although he may also
   have pancreatitis (suggested by labs but not by physical exam).  His
   imaging is suggestive of coincident cholecystitis, but he has no
   indication at present for urgent cholecystectomy.  Although biliary
   sludge or gallstones may explain all of the above findings, would also
   consider that he is an elderly gentleman with a smoking history.  It is
   unclear if his age-appropriate cancer screening is up to date.
   - continue unasyn (3g Q6H; Day 1 = [**6-30**]) but would add vancomycin to
   cover enterococcus if he clinically worsens
   - IV fluids for hydration, but will be a little less aggressive with
   boluses given mild crackles on exam (note that pt is on lasix at home,
   although the indication is unclear)
   - morphine IV for pain
   - plan for ERCP in AM
   - monitor clinical exam, VS
   - appreciate surgical input re: possibility of cholecystectomy
 NOTE
   pt wants to move to West Haven [**Hospital **] Hospital for this procedure due to
   proximity to home.
   - follow LFTs, fever curve, mental status
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u final reads of CT
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt noted to be in Afib with RVR on [**2143-7-2**]
   around 1pm, asymptomatic (no chest pain or palpitations).  Pt treated
   with lopressor 5mg x 3, diltiazem 10 mg x2, loaded with PO metoprolol.
   Initial CK and troponin c normal. 12-lead EKG with Afib.
   - review previous echo
   - continue monitoring rate
   - continue metoprolol (previously on medicaton as outpatient)
   # Low grade fevers:
   Likely due to above, but will send UA/UCx and f/u BCx in this
   diabetic.  Also note that he has a cough on exam, although he states
   this is a chronic cough for him, likely from bronchitis due to his long
   smoking history.
   .
   # HTN:
   Pt hypertensive to SBP in 230s in the ED.  Given concern for developing
   cholangitis, will hold back on giving him all of his home meds, but
   will start short-acting ACE I to prevent severe HTN.
   - captopril 12.5mg TID; titrate up as needed for goal BPs < 170/110
   - will hold patient's metoprolol for now so as not to mask tachycardic
   response
   .
   # Altered mental status:
   [**Month (only) 51**] be due to sundowning in this elderly gentleman who has been to
   multiple hospitals and received IV narcotics.  Would also be concerned
   about CO2 retention given smoking history.  Although altered mental
   status can be a marker of worsening cholangitis, he has not shown
   evidence of septic physiology, so this is less likely the culprit.
   Finally, given elevated pressures in ED, ICH is in differential.
   - CT Head to rule out bleed
   - cautious use of narcotic medications
   - check ABG
   - monitor
   .
   # DM:
   Apparently, only on oral meds at home.  Elevated glucose in ED likely
   due to infection, stress reaction.
   -          SSI for now, consider long acting insulin when transfer to
   floor
   -          Consider restarting home meds
   .
   # Mild gap acidosis:
   - lactate was normal in the ED, AG now 14
   - will monitor
   .
   # Nausea:
   Resolved, was likely related to possible cholangitis/pancreatitis.
   However, given that he is a diabetic with a history of coronary
   disease, this can be a sign of cardiac ischemia.  EKG is reassuring.
   - monitor
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG:
   - continue ASA
   - holding beta blocker as above
   - continue ACE inhibitor
   - continue statin
   .
   # PVD:
   - holding cilostazol as non-formulary med
   .
   # Question of thyroid nodule:  Per review of OSH records.
   - will check TFTs
   - follow up as outpatient
   .
   # Tobacco abuse:
   - counsel regarding tobacco cessation
   - offer nicotine patch
   - continue advair for ?? COPD; will not order equivalent of formoterol
   or mom[**Name (NI) **] as he has beta agonist and steroid in advair
   .
   # Likely dyslipidemia:
   Not on problem list from OSH records, but on statin and gemfibrozil.
   -restarted simvastatin, holding gemfibrozil until LFTs improve
   .
   # Likely BPH:  hold terazosin for now in case his BP begins to drop
   from cholangitis, but will monitor
   .
   # Anemia:  current hct 33, baseline hct not known
   - check iron studies, retics, peripheral smear
   - active type and screen given h/o GI bleed
   - stool is guaiac negative
   - monitor
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, who presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and obstructive liver function tests (LFTs) concerning for cholangitis.

The patient underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy, stent placement, and drainage of bile with pus. He was diagnosed with cholecystitis, calculous, and pancreatitis. The patient's laboratory results showed elevated liver enzymes, including alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, as well as elevated bilirubin levels.

The patient's physical examination was notable for mild crackles on lung auscultation, and his electrocardiogram (ECG) showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He was treated with lopressor, diltiazem, and metoprolol for his atrial fibrillation.

The patient's medical history is significant for tobacco abuse, and he has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He is also taking medications for his conditions, including aspirin, metoprolol, and simvastatin.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cholangitis: The patient's diagnosis of cholecystitis, calculous, and pancreatitis increases the risk of cholangitis, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and mortality.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms, including cough and mild crackles on lung auscultation, increase the risk of pneumonia.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and his current diagnosis of pancreatitis increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Sepsis: The patient's diagnosis of cholangitis and pancreatitis increases the risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and mortality.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation increase the risk of cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory symptoms, including cough and mild crackles on lung auscultation, increase the risk of respiratory complications, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
8. Renal complications: The patient's diagnosis of pancreatitis and cholangitis increases the risk of renal complications, including acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.

In conclusion, the patient's complex medical history and current diagnosis of cholecystitis, calculous, and pancreatitis increase the risk of various medical complications. Close monitoring and management of the patient's condition are essential to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
   77yo gentleman with CAD, HTN, and DM presenting with RUQ pain and
   obstructive LFTs concerning for cholangitis.
   # RUQ pain / Elevated LFTs:
   Clinical presentation concerning for cholangitis, although he may also
   have pancreatitis (suggested by labs but not by physical exam).  His
   imaging is suggestive of coincident cholecystitis, but he has no
   indication at present for urgent cholecystectomy.  Although biliary
   sludge or gallstones may explain all of the above findings, would also
   consider that he is an elderly gentleman with a smoking history.  It is
   unclear if his age-appropriate cancer screening is up to date.
   - continue unasyn (3g Q6H; Day 1 = [**6-30**]) but would add vancomycin to
   cover enterococcus if he clinically worsens
   - IV fluids for hydration, but will be a little less aggressive with
   boluses given mild crackles on exam (note that pt is on lasix at home,
   although the indication is unclear)
   - morphine IV for pain
   - plan for ERCP in AM
   - monitor clinical exam, VS
   - appreciate surgical input re: possibility of cholecystectomy
 NOTE
   pt wants to move to West Haven [**Hospital **] Hospital for this procedure due to
   proximity to home.
   - follow LFTs, fever curve, mental status
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u final reads of CT
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt noted to be in Afib with RVR on [**2143-7-2**]
   around 1pm, asymptomatic (no chest pain or palpitations).  Pt treated
   with lopressor 5mg x 3, diltiazem 10 mg x2, loaded with PO metoprolol.
   Initial CK and troponin c normal. 12-lead EKG with Afib.
   - review previous echo
   - continue monitoring rate
   - continue metoprolol (previously on medicaton as outpatient)
   - check second set of CE
s at 9pm
   # Low grade fevers:
   Likely due to above, but will send UA/UCx and f/u BCx in this
   diabetic.  Also note that he has a cough on exam, although he states
   this is a chronic cough for him, likely from bronchitis due to his long
   smoking history.
   .
   # HTN:
   Pt hypertensive to SBP in 230s in the ED.  Given concern for developing
   cholangitis, will hold back on giving him all of his home meds, but
   will start short-acting ACE I to prevent severe HTN.
   - captopril 12.5mg TID; titrate up as needed for goal BPs < 170/110
   - was holding metoprolol to avoid masking tachycardia, however, due to
   Afib metoprolol started.
   .
   # Altered mental status:
   Pt. no longer altered.  [**Month (only) 51**] be due to sundowning in this elderly
   gentleman who has been to multiple hospitals and received IV
   narcotics.  Would also be concerned about CO2 retention given smoking
   history.  Although altered mental status can be a marker of worsening
   cholangitis, he has not shown evidence of septic physiology, so this is
   less likely the culprit.  Finally, given elevated pressures in ED, ICH
   is in differential.
   - cautious use of narcotic medications
   - monitor
   .
   # DM:
   Apparently, only on oral meds at home.  Elevated glucose in ED likely
   due to infection, stress reaction.
   -          SSI for now, consider long acting insulin when transfer to
   floor
   -          Consider restarting home meds
   -          Verify home meds with significant other
   .
   # Mild gap acidosis:
   - lactate was normal in the ED, AG now 14
   - will monitor
   .
   # Nausea:
   Resolved, was likely related to possible cholangitis/pancreatitis.
   However, given that he is a diabetic with a history of coronary
   disease, this can be a sign of cardiac ischemia.  EKG is reassuring.
   - monitor
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG:
   - continue ASA
   - continue ACE inhibitor
   - continue statin
   .
   # PVD:
   - holding cilostazol as non-formulary med
   .
   # Question of thyroid nodule:  Per review of OSH records.
   - will check TFTs
   - follow up as outpatient
   .
   # Tobacco abuse:
   - counsel regarding tobacco cessation
   - offer nicotine patch
   - continue advair for ?? COPD; will not order equivalent of formoterol
   or mom[**Name (NI) **] as he has beta agonist and steroid in advair
   .
   # Likely dyslipidemia:
   Not on problem list from OSH records, but on statin and gemfibrozil.
   -restarted simvastatin, holding gemfibrozil until LFTs improve
   .
   # Likely BPH:  hold terazosin for now in case his BP begins to drop
   from cholangitis, but will monitor
   .
   # Anemia:  current hct 33, baseline hct not known
   - check iron studies, retics, peripheral smear
   - active type and screen given h/o GI bleed
   - stool is guaiac negative

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   indication at present for urgent cholecystectomy.  Although biliary
   sludge or gallstones may explain all of the above findings, would also
   consider that he is an elderly gentleman with a smoking history.  It is
   unclear if his age-appropriate cancer screening is up to date.
   - continue unasyn (3g Q6H; Day 1 = [**6-30**]) but would add vancomycin to
   cover enterococcus if he clinically worsens
   - IV fluids for hydration, but will be a little less aggressive with
   boluses given mild crackles on exam (note that pt is on lasix at home,
   although the indication is unclear)
   - morphine IV for pain
   - plan for ERCP in AM
   - monitor clinical exam, VS
   - appreciate surgical input re: possibility of cholecystectomy
 NOTE
   pt wants to move to West Haven [**Hospital **] Hospital for this procedure due to
   proximity to home.
   - follow LFTs, fever curve, mental status
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u final reads of CT
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt noted to be in Afib with RVR on [**2143-7-2**]
   around 1pm, asymptomatic (no chest pain or palpitations).  Pt treated
   with lopressor 5mg x 3, diltiazem 10 mg x2, loaded with PO metoprolol.
   Initial CK and troponin c normal. 12-lead EKG with Afib.
   - review previous echo
   - continue monitoring rate
   - continue metoprolol (previously on medicaton as outpatient)
   - check second set of CE
s at 9pm
   # Low grade fevers:
   Likely due to above, but will send UA/UCx and f/u BCx in this
   diabetic.  Also note that he has a cough on exam, although he states
   this is a chronic cough for him, likely from bronchitis due to his long
   smoking history.
   .
   # HTN:
   Pt hypertensive to SBP in 230s in the ED.  Given concern for developing
   cholangitis, will hold back on giving him all of his home meds, but
   will start short-acting ACE I to prevent severe HTN.
   - captopril 12.5mg TID; titrate up as needed for goal BPs < 170/110
   - was holding metoprolol to avoid masking tachycardia, however, due to
   Afib metoprolol started.
   .
   # Altered mental status:
   Pt. no longer altered.  [**Month (only) 51**] be due to sundowning in this elderly
   gentleman who has been to multiple hospitals and received IV
   narcotics.  Would also be concerned about CO2 retention given smoking
   history.  Although altered mental status can be a marker of worsening
   cholangitis, he has not shown evidence of septic physiology, so this is
   less likely the culprit.  Finally, given elevated pressures in ED, ICH
   is in differential.
   - cautious use of narcotic medications
   - monitor
   .
   # DM:
   Apparently, only on oral meds at home.  Elevated glucose in ED likely
   due to infection, stress reaction.
   -          SSI for now, consider long acting insulin when transfer to
   floor
   -          Consider restarting home meds
   -          Verify home meds with significant other
   .
   # Mild gap acidosis:
   - lactate was normal in the ED, AG now 14
   - will monitor
   .
   # Nausea:
   Resolved, was likely related to possible cholangitis/pancreatitis.
   However, given that he is a diabetic with a history of coronary
   disease, this can be a sign of cardiac ischemia.  EKG is reassuring.
   - monitor
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG:
   - continue ASA
   - continue ACE inhibitor
   - continue statin
   .
   # PVD:
   - holding cilostazol as non-formulary med
   .
   # Question of thyroid nodule:  Per review of OSH records.
   - will check TFTs
   - follow up as outpatient
   .
   # Tobacco abuse:
   - counsel regarding tobacco cessation
   - offer nicotine patch
   - continue advair for ?? COPD; will not order equivalent of formoterol
   or mom[**Name (NI) **] as he has beta agonist and steroid in advair
   .
   # Likely dyslipidemia:
   Not on problem list from OSH records, but on statin and gemfibrozil.
   -restarted simvastatin, holding gemfibrozil until LFTs improve
   .
   # Likely BPH:  hold terazosin for now in case his BP begins to drop
   from cholangitis, but will monitor
   .
   # Anemia:  current hct 33, baseline hct not known
   - check iron studies, retics, peripheral smear

   # RUQ pain / Elevated LFTs:
   Clinical presentation concerning for cholangitis, although he may also

   cover enterococcus if he clinically worsens
   - IV fluids for hydration, but will be a little less aggressive with
   boluses given mild crackles on exam (note that pt is on lasix at home,
   although the indication is unclear)
   - morphine IV for pain
   - plan for ERCP in AM
   - monitor clinical exam, VS
   - appreciate surgical input re: possibility of cholecystectomy
   - follow LFTs, fever curve, mental status
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u final reads of CT and ultrasound
   .
   # Low grade fevers:
   Likely due to above, but will send UA/UCx and f/u BCx in this
   diabetic.  Also note that he has a cough on exam, although he states
   this is a chronic cough for him, likely from bronchitis due to his long

   Pt hypertensive to SBP in 230s in the ED.  Given concern for developing
   cholangitis, will hold back on giving him all of his home meds, but
   will start short-acting ACE I to prevent severe HTN.
   - captopril 12.5mg TID; titrate up as needed for goal BPs < 170/110
   - will hold patient's metoprolol for now so as not to mask tachycardic
   response
   .
   # Altered mental status:
   [**Month (only) 51**] be due to sundowning in this elderly gentleman who has been to

   about CO2 retention given smoking history.  Although altered mental
   status can be a marker of worsening cholangitis, he has not shown
   evidence of septic physiology, so this is less likely the culprit.
   Finally, given elevated pressures in ED, ICH is in differential.
   - CT Head to rule out bleed
   - cautious use of narcotic medications
   - check ABG
   - monitor
   .
   # DM:
   Apparently, only on oral meds at home.  Elevated glucose in ED likely
   due to infection, stress reaction.
   - SSI for now, but may need long acting insulin if sugars are poorly
   controlled

   # Mild gap acidosis:
   - lactate was normal in the ED
   - recheck ABG with lactate
   .
   # Nausea:
   Likely related to possible cholangitis/pancreatitis.  However, given
   that he is a diabetic with a history of coronary disease, this can be a
   sign of cardiac ischemia.  EKG is reassuring.
   - check cardiac biomarkers in AM

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
   77yo gentleman with CAD, HTN, and DM presenting with RUQ pain and
   obstructive LFTs concerning for cholangitis.
   .
   # RUQ pain / Elevated LFTs:
   Clinical presentation concerning for cholangitis, although he may also
   have pancreatitis (suggested by labs but not by physical exam).  His
   imaging is suggestive of coincident cholecystitis, but he has no
   indication at present for urgent cholecystectomy.  Although biliary
   sludge or gallstones may explain all of the above findings, would also
   consider that he is an elderly gentleman with a smoking history.  It is
   unclear if his age-appropriate cancer screening is up to date.
   - continue unasyn (3g Q6H; Day 1 = [**6-30**]) but would add vancomycin to
   cover enterococcus if he clinically worsens
   - IV fluids for hydration, but will be a little less aggressive with
   boluses given mild crackles on exam (note that pt is on lasix at home,
   although the indication is unclear)
   - morphine IV for pain
   - plan for ERCP in AM
   - monitor clinical exam, VS
   - appreciate surgical input re: possibility of cholecystectomy
   - follow LFTs, fever curve, mental status
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u final reads of CT and ultrasound
   .
   # Low grade fevers:
   Likely due to above, but will send UA/UCx and f/u BCx in this
   diabetic.  Also note that he has a cough on exam, although he states
   this is a chronic cough for him, likely from bronchitis due to his long
   smoking history.
   .
   # HTN:
   Pt hypertensive to SBP in 230s in the ED.  Given concern for developing
   cholangitis, will hold back on giving him all of his home meds, but
   will start short-acting ACE I to prevent severe HTN.
   - captopril 12.5mg TID; titrate up as needed for goal BPs < 170/110
   - will hold patient's metoprolol for now so as not to mask tachycardic
   response
   .
   # Altered mental status:
   [**Month (only) 51**] be due to sundowning in this elderly gentleman who has been to
   multiple hospitals and received IV narcotics.  Would also be concerned
   about CO2 retention given smoking history.  Although altered mental
   status can be a marker of worsening cholangitis, he has not shown
   evidence of septic physiology, so this is less likely the culprit.
   Finally, given elevated pressures in ED, ICH is in differential.
   - CT Head to rule out bleed
   - cautious use of narcotic medications
   - check ABG
   - monitor
   .
   # DM:
   Apparently, only on oral meds at home.  Elevated glucose in ED likely
   due to infection, stress reaction.
   - SSI for now, but may need long acting insulin if sugars are poorly
   controlled
   .
   # Mild gap acidosis:
   - lactate was normal in the ED
   - recheck ABG with lactate
   .
   # Nausea:
   Likely related to possible cholangitis/pancreatitis.  However, given
   that he is a diabetic with a history of coronary disease, this can be a
   sign of cardiac ischemia.  EKG is reassuring.
   - check cardiac biomarkers in AM
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG:
   - continue ASA
   - holding beta blocker as above
   - continue ACE inhibitor
   - restarted statin
   .
   # PVD:
   - holding cilostazol as non-formulary med
   .
   # Question of thyroid nodule:  Per review of OSH records.
   - will check TFTs
   .
   # Tobacco abuse:
   - counsel regarding tobacco cessation
   - offer nicotine patch
   - continue advair for ?? COPD; will not order equivalent of formoterol
   or mom[**Name (NI) **] as he has beta agonist and steroid in advair
   .
   # Likely dyslipidemia:
   Not on problem list from OSH records, but on statin and gemfibrozil.
   -restarted simvastatin, holding gemfibrozil until LFTs improve
   .
   # Likely BPH:  hold terazosin for now in case his BP begins to drop
   from cholangitis, but will monitor
   .
   # Anemia:  current hct 33, baseline hct not known
   - check iron studies, retics, peripheral smear
   - active type and screen given h/o GI bleed
   - stool is guaiac negative
   - monitor
   .
   # h/o Prostate CA:  resolved, per pt

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Cholangitis: The patient's symptoms, including RUQ pain and elevated LFTs, are concerning for cholangitis. The ERCP procedure may have relieved some of the obstruction, but the patient will need to undergo repeat ERCP in 6 weeks to remove the stone and stent.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's symptoms, including RUQ pain and elevated LFTs, could also be consistent with pancreatitis. The patient's gallstone pancreatitis is being managed with NPO and IVF.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient developed pulmonary edema, which was treated with lasix. The patient's oxygen saturation levels were low, and they required increased oxygen therapy.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure was elevated, and they were started on captopril to prevent severe hypertension.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to sundowning, CO2 retention, or septic physiology. A CT Head was ordered to rule out bleed.
6. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient's elevated glucose levels could be due to infection, stress reaction, or diabetic ketoacidosis.
7. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's nausea could be a sign of cardiac ischemia, especially given their history of coronary disease.
8. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with low oxygen saturation levels and pulmonary edema.
9. Sepsis: The patient's low-grade fevers and elevated white blood cell count could be indicative of sepsis.
10. Anemia: The patient's current HCT level is 33, and they have a history of GI bleed. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of their anemia.

The patient's medications include:

* Unasyn (ampicillin and sulbactam) for coverage of enterococcus
* Lasix (furosemide) for fluid management and treatment of pulmonary edema
* Morphine for pain management
* Captopril for hypertension management
* Vancomycin for coverage of enterococcus (if the patient clinically worsens)
* Omeprazole (Prilosec) for prophylaxis of stress ulcer
* Heparin sodium (prophylaxis) for DVT prevention
* Furosemide (Lasix) for fluid management and treatment of pulmonary edema
* Metoprolol (held) for hypertension management
* Statin (restarted) for lipid management
* Simvastatin (restarted) for lipid management
* Gemfibrozil (held) for lipid management
* Terazosin (held) for BPH management

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
 CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
   77yo gentleman with CAD, HTN, and DM presenting with RUQ pain and
   obstructive LFTs concerning for cholangitis.
   # RUQ pain / Elevated LFTs:
   Clinical presentation concerning for cholangitis, although he may also
   have pancreatitis (suggested by labs but not by physical exam).  His
   imaging is suggestive of coincident cholecystitis, but he has no
   indication at present for urgent cholecystectomy.  Although biliary
   sludge or gallstones may explain all of the above findings, would also
   consider that he is an elderly gentleman with a smoking history.  It is
   unclear if his age-appropriate cancer screening is up to date.
   - continue unasyn (3g Q6H; Day 1 = [**6-30**]) but would add vancomycin to
   cover enterococcus if he clinically worsens
   - IV fluids for hydration, but will be a little less aggressive with
   boluses given mild crackles on exam (note that pt is on lasix at home,
   although the indication is unclear)
   - morphine IV for pain
   - plan for ERCP in AM
   - monitor clinical exam, VS
   - appreciate surgical input re: possibility of cholecystectomy
   - follow LFTs, fever curve, mental status
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u final reads of CT and ultrasound
   .
   # Low grade fevers:
   Likely due to above, but will send UA/UCx and f/u BCx in this
   diabetic.  Also note that he has a cough on exam, although he states
   this is a chronic cough for him, likely from bronchitis due to his long
   smoking history.
   .
   # HTN:
   Pt hypertensive to SBP in 230s in the ED.  Given concern for developing
   cholangitis, will hold back on giving him all of his home meds, but
   will start short-acting ACE I to prevent severe HTN.
   - captopril 12.5mg TID; titrate up as needed for goal BPs < 170/110
   - will hold patient's metoprolol for now so as not to mask tachycardic
   response
   .
   # Altered mental status:
   [**Month (only) 51**] be due to sundowning in this elderly gentleman who has been to
   multiple hospitals and received IV narcotics.  Would also be concerned
   about CO2 retention given smoking history.  Although altered mental
   status can be a marker of worsening cholangitis, he has not shown
   evidence of septic physiology, so this is less likely the culprit.
   Finally, given elevated pressures in ED, ICH is in differential.
   - CT Head to rule out bleed
   - cautious use of narcotic medications
   - check ABG
   - monitor
   .
   # DM:
   Apparently, only on oral meds at home.  Elevated glucose in ED likely
   due to infection, stress reaction.
   -          SSI for now, consider long acting insulin when transfer to
   floor
   -          Consider restarting home meds
   .
   # Mild gap acidosis:
   - lactate was normal in the ED, AG now 14
   - will monitor
   .
   # Nausea:
   Resolved, was likely related to possible cholangitis/pancreatitis.
   However, given that he is a diabetic with a history of coronary
   disease, this can be a sign of cardiac ischemia.  EKG is reassuring.
   - monitor
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG:
   - continue ASA
   - holding beta blocker as above
   - continue ACE inhibitor
   - continue statin
   .
   # PVD:
   - holding cilostazol as non-formulary med
   .
   # Question of thyroid nodule:  Per review of OSH records.
   - will check TFTs
   - follow up as outpatient
   .
   # Tobacco abuse:
   - counsel regarding tobacco cessation
   - offer nicotine patch
   - continue advair for ?? COPD; will not order equivalent of formoterol
   or mom[**Name (NI) **] as he has beta agonist and steroid in advair
   .
   # Likely dyslipidemia:
   Not on problem list from OSH records, but on statin and gemfibrozil.
   -restarted simvastatin, holding gemfibrozil until LFTs improve
   .
   # Likely BPH:  hold terazosin for now in case his BP begins to drop
   from cholangitis, but will monitor
   .
   # Anemia:  current hct 33, baseline hct not known
   - check iron studies, retics, peripheral smear
   - active type and screen given h/o GI bleed
   - stool is guaiac negative
   - monitor
   .
   # h/o Prostate CA:  resolved, per pt

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of CAD, HTN, and DM, presenting with RUQ pain and obstructive LFTs concerning for cholangitis. He underwent ERCP, which showed a stone in the bile duct, and a sphincterotomy was performed. A stent was placed, and bile with pus was drained. He is currently in the ICU receiving IVF and oxygen therapy. His vital signs are stable, and he is alert and sitting up comfortably. However, he has developed mild pulmonary edema, which was treated with Lasix. He is also experiencing low-grade fevers, which are likely due to the underlying infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cholangitis: The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest cholangitis, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and even death if left untreated.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's symptoms and lab results also suggest pancreatitis, which can lead to organ failure and death if left untreated.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's mild pulmonary edema and low-grade fevers may progress to respiratory failure if not managed promptly.
4. Sepsis: The patient's low-grade fevers and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death if left untreated.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CAD and HTN increases his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, MI, and heart failure.
6. Renal Complications: The patient's history of DM and HTN increases his risk of renal complications, such as acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status may be due to sundowning, CO2 retention, or other factors, which can lead to neurological complications such as seizures, coma, and death.
8. Infection: The patient's low-grade fevers and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure if left untreated.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IVF and oxygen therapy to manage the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs, including oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and heart rate, to detect any changes or complications.
3. Monitor the patient's lab results, including white blood cell count, liver function tests, and kidney function tests, to detect any changes or complications.
4. Consider adding antibiotics to cover enterococcus if the patient's clinical condition worsens.
5. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider ordering a CT Head to rule out bleeding or other neurological complications.
6. Consider restarting the patient's home medications, including metoprolol and simvastatin, once his condition stabilizes.
7. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and consider restarting insulin therapy if necessary.
8. Consider ordering a stress test to evaluate the patient's cardiac function and risk of cardiac complications.
9. Monitor the patient's kidney function and consider ordering a nephrology consult if necessary.
10. Consider ordering a neurology consult to evaluate the patient's altered mental status and risk of neurological complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory distress due to acute pulmonary edema. The patient has undergone ERCP with stent placement and has been experiencing RUQ pain, fever, and chills, which are concerning for cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 163/45 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 27 inspirations per minute. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 96%. The patient's physical examination is notable for no acute distress, and the patient appears comfortable.

The patient's laboratory results are concerning for elevated liver enzymes, lipase, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which may indicate pancreatitis, cholecystitis, or choledocholithiasis. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hypokalemia and elevated lactate levels.

The patient's medical history is significant for no known drug allergies, and the patient has been receiving antibiotics, diuretics, and pain medication. The patient's family history is significant for no known medical conditions.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis
* Sepsis, with concern for cholescystitis
* Empirical Unasyn therapy
* Respiratory distress, attributed to acute pulmonary edema, with resolution of symptoms
* RUQ pain, attributed to cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis, with evaluation by General Surgery and ERCP team
* Fluid repletion, with goal of net negative fluid balance
* Elevated liver enzymes and lipase, with monitoring and potential nutritional support
* Altered mental status, likely related to medications, with resolution
* Hypokalemia, with repletion to K >4.0
* Nutritional support, with NPO status
* ICU care, including glycemic control, lines, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of respiratory distress due to acute pulmonary edema
* Development of sepsis or organ failure
* Complications from cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis, such as pancreatitis or cholangitis
* Electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia or hyperkalemia
* Nutritional deficiencies, including malnutrition or dehydration
* Increased risk of infection, including VAP or DVT."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory distress due to acute pulmonary edema. The patient has undergone ERCP with stent placement and has been experiencing RUQ pain, fever, and chills, which are concerns for cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute pulmonary edema can lead to respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, chills, and elevated WBC count suggest sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Pancreatitis: The elevated lipase levels indicate pancreatitis, which can lead to severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
4. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium levels are low, which can lead to muscle weakness, fatigue, and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's elevated LFTs and lipase levels suggest electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
6. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated WBC count suggest infection, which can spread to other parts of the body and lead to sepsis.
7. Organ failure: The patient's critically ill state and organ dysfunction can lead to organ failure, including respiratory, cardiac, and renal failure.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's NPO status and altered mental status may lead to nutritional deficiencies, which can exacerbate the patient's condition.

To address these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management, including:

1. Respiratory support: The patient may require mechanical ventilation to manage respiratory failure.
2. Antibiotic therapy: The patient may require antibiotic therapy to treat sepsis and infection.
3. Pain management: The patient's RUQ pain and fever may require aggressive pain management.
4. Electrolyte management: The patient's electrolyte imbalances may require correction with IV fluids and medications.
5. Nutritional support: The patient's NPO status may require nutritional support, such as total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
6. Cardiovascular monitoring: The patient's critically ill state and hypokalemia may require close cardiovascular monitoring to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and failure.
7. Renal monitoring: The patient's electrolyte imbalances and potential organ failure may require close renal monitoring to prevent acute kidney injury (AKI)."

   Assessment and Plan
 CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
   77yo gentleman with CAD, HTN, and DM presenting with RUQ pain and
   obstructive LFTs concerning for cholangitis.
   # RUQ pain / Elevated LFTs:
   Clinical presentation concerning for cholangitis, although he may also
   have pancreatitis (suggested by labs but not by physical exam).  His
   imaging is suggestive of coincident cholecystitis, but he has no
   indication at present for urgent cholecystectomy.  Although biliary
   sludge or gallstones may explain all of the above findings, would also
   consider that he is an elderly gentleman with a smoking history.  It is
   unclear if his age-appropriate cancer screening is up to date.
   - continue unasyn (3g Q6H; Day 1 = [**6-30**]) but would add vancomycin to
   cover enterococcus if he clinically worsens
   - IV fluids for hydration, but will be a little less aggressive with
   boluses given mild crackles on exam (note that pt is on lasix at home,
   although the indication is unclear)
   - morphine IV for pain
   - plan for ERCP in AM
   - monitor clinical exam, VS
   - appreciate surgical input re: possibility of cholecystectomy
 NOTE
   pt wants to move to West Haven [**Hospital **] Hospital for this procedure due to
   proximity to home.
   - follow LFTs, fever curve, mental status
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u final reads of CT
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt noted to be in Afib with RVR on [**2143-7-2**]
   around 1pm, asymptomatic (no chest pain or palpitations).  Pt treated
   with lopressor 5mg x 3, diltiazem 10 mg x2, loaded with PO metoprolol.
   Initial CK and troponin c normal. 12-lead EKG with Afib.
   - review previous echo
   - continue monitoring rate
   - continue metoprolol (previously on medicaton as outpatient)
   - check second set of CE
s at 9pm
   # Low grade fevers:
   Likely due to above, but will send UA/UCx and f/u BCx in this
   diabetic.  Also note that he has a cough on exam, although he states
   this is a chronic cough for him, likely from bronchitis due to his long
   smoking history.
   .
   # HTN:
   Pt hypertensive to SBP in 230s in the ED.  Given concern for developing
   cholangitis, will hold back on giving him all of his home meds, but
   will start short-acting ACE I to prevent severe HTN.
   - captopril 12.5mg TID; titrate up as needed for goal BPs < 170/110
   - was holding metoprolol to avoid masking tachycardia, however, due to
   Afib metoprolol started.
   .
   # Altered mental status:
   Pt. no longer altered.  [**Month (only) 51**] be due to sundowning in this elderly
   gentleman who has been to multiple hospitals and received IV
   narcotics.  Would also be concerned about CO2 retention given smoking
   history.  Although altered mental status can be a marker of worsening
   cholangitis, he has not shown evidence of septic physiology, so this is
   less likely the culprit.  Finally, given elevated pressures in ED, ICH
   is in differential.
   - cautious use of narcotic medications
   - monitor
   .
   # DM:
   Apparently, only on oral meds at home.  Elevated glucose in ED likely
   due to infection, stress reaction.
   -          SSI for now, consider long acting insulin when transfer to
   floor
   -          Consider restarting home meds
   -          Verify home meds with significant other
   .
   # Mild gap acidosis:
   - lactate was normal in the ED, AG now 14
   - will monitor
   .
   # Nausea:
   Resolved, was likely related to possible cholangitis/pancreatitis.
   However, given that he is a diabetic with a history of coronary
   disease, this can be a sign of cardiac ischemia.  EKG is reassuring.
   - monitor
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG:
   - continue ASA
   - continue ACE inhibitor
   - continue statin
   .
   # PVD:
   - holding cilostazol as non-formulary med
   .
   # Question of thyroid nodule:  Per review of OSH records.
   - will check TFTs
   - follow up as outpatient
   .
   # Tobacco abuse:
   - counsel regarding tobacco cessation
   - offer nicotine patch
   - continue advair for ?? COPD; will not order equivalent of formoterol
   or mom[**Name (NI) **] as he has beta agonist and steroid in advair
   .
   # Likely dyslipidemia:
   Not on problem list from OSH records, but on statin and gemfibrozil.
   -restarted simvastatin, holding gemfibrozil until LFTs improve
   .
   # Likely BPH:  hold terazosin for now in case his BP begins to drop
   from cholangitis, but will monitor
   .
   # Anemia:  current hct 33, baseline hct not known
   - check iron studies, retics, peripheral smear
   - active type and screen given h/o GI bleed
   - stool is guaiac negative
   - monitor
   .
   # h/o Prostate CA:  resolved, per pt

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
   77yo gentleman with CAD, HTN, and DM presenting with RUQ pain and
   obstructive LFTs concerning for cholangitis.
   # RUQ pain / Elevated LFTs:
   Clinical presentation concerning for cholangitis, although he may also
   have pancreatitis (suggested by labs but not by physical exam).  His
   imaging is suggestive of coincident cholecystitis, but he has no
   indication at present for urgent cholecystectomy.  Although biliary
   sludge or gallstones may explain all of the above findings, would also
   consider that he is an elderly gentleman with a smoking history.  It is
   unclear if his age-appropriate cancer screening is up to date.
   - continue unasyn (3g Q6H; Day 1 = [**6-30**]) but would add vancomycin to
   cover enterococcus if he clinically worsens
   - IV fluids for hydration, but will be a little less aggressive with
   boluses given mild crackles on exam (note that pt is on lasix at home,
   although the indication is unclear)
   - morphine IV for pain
   - plan for ERCP in AM
   - monitor clinical exam, VS
   - appreciate surgical input re: possibility of cholecystectomy
 NOTE
   pt wants to move to West Haven [**Hospital **] Hospital for this procedure due to
   proximity to home.
   - follow LFTs, fever curve, mental status
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u final reads of CT
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt noted to be in Afib with RVR on [**2143-7-2**]
   around 1pm, asymptomatic (no chest pain or palpitations).  Pt treated
   with lopressor 5mg x 3, diltiazem 10 mg x2, loaded with PO metoprolol.
   Initial CK and troponin c normal. 12-lead EKG with Afib.
   - review previous echo
   - continue monitoring rate
   - continue metoprolol (previously on medicaton as outpatient)
   - check second set of CE
s at 9pm
   # Low grade fevers:
   Likely due to above, but will send UA/UCx and f/u BCx in this
   diabetic.  Also note that he has a cough on exam, although he states
   this is a chronic cough for him, likely from bronchitis due to his long
   smoking history.
   .
   # HTN:
   Pt hypertensive to SBP in 230s in the ED.  Given concern for developing
   cholangitis, will hold back on giving him all of his home meds, but
   will start short-acting ACE I to prevent severe HTN.
   - captopril 12.5mg TID; titrate up as needed for goal BPs < 170/110
   - was holding metoprolol to avoid masking tachycardia, however, due to
   Afib metoprolol started.
   .
   # Altered mental status:
   Pt. no longer altered.  [**Month (only) 51**] be due to sundowning in this elderly
   gentleman who has been to multiple hospitals and received IV
   narcotics.  Would also be concerned about CO2 retention given smoking
   history.  Although altered mental status can be a marker of worsening
   cholangitis, he has not shown evidence of septic physiology, so this is
   less likely the culprit.  Finally, given elevated pressures in ED, ICH
   is in differential.
   - cautious use of narcotic medications
   - monitor
   .
   # DM:
   Apparently, only on oral meds at home.  Elevated glucose in ED likely
   due to infection, stress reaction.
   -          SSI for now, consider long acting insulin when transfer to
   floor
   -          Consider restarting home meds
   -          Verify home meds with significant other
   .
   # Mild gap acidosis:
   - lactate was normal in the ED, AG now 14
   - will monitor
   .
   # Nausea:
   Resolved, was likely related to possible cholangitis/pancreatitis.
   However, given that he is a diabetic with a history of coronary
   disease, this can be a sign of cardiac ischemia.  EKG is reassuring.
   - monitor
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG:
   - continue ASA
   - continue ACE inhibitor
   - continue statin
   .
   # PVD:
   - holding cilostazol as non-formulary med
   .
   # Question of thyroid nodule:  Per review of OSH records.
   - will check TFTs
   - follow up as outpatient
   .
   # Tobacco abuse:
   - counsel regarding tobacco cessation
   - offer nicotine patch
   - continue advair for ?? COPD; will not order equivalent of formoterol
   or mom[**Name (NI) **] as he has beta agonist and steroid in advair
   .
   # Likely dyslipidemia:
   Not on problem list from OSH records, but on statin and gemfibrozil.
   -restarted simvastatin, holding gemfibrozil until LFTs improve
   .
   # Likely BPH:  hold terazosin for now in case his BP begins to drop
   from cholangitis, but will monitor
   .
   # Anemia:  current hct 33, baseline hct not known
   - check iron studies, retics, peripheral smear
   - active type and screen given h/o GI bleed
   - stool is guaiac negative
   - monitor

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
 CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
   77yo gentleman with CAD, HTN, and DM presenting with RUQ pain and
   obstructive LFTs concerning for cholangitis.
   # RUQ pain / Elevated LFTs:
   Clinical presentation concerning for cholangitis vs pancreatitis
   (suggested by labs but not by physical exam).  Imaging was consistent
   with coincident cholecystitis, but he had no indication at present for
   urgent cholecystectomy.  s/p ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent
   placement (see ERCP report for further results).  He is clinically
   improved and is experiencing no further abdominal discomfort.
   - continue unasyn (3g Q6H; Day 1 = [**6-30**]) but would add vancomycin to
   cover enterococcus if he clinically worsens
   - appreciate surgical input re: possibility of cholecystectomy who
   agree with plan to transfer patient as per request to West Haven VA
   - follow LFTs, fever curve, mental status
   - f/u final reads of CT
   -pt will need repeat ERCP in 6 weeks to pull billiary stent
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt noted to be in Afib with RVR on [**2143-7-2**]
   around 1pm, asymptomatic (no chest pain or palpitations).  Pt treated
   with lopressor 5mg x 3, diltiazem 10 mg x2, loaded with PO metoprolol.
   CK normal with troponin leak. 12-lead EKG with Afib.  Patient developed
   hypotension with increase dose metoprolol to 75mg PO TID
   - etiology: unclear whether new onset vs. paroxysmal Afib (enlarged
   LAE); will check VA records
   - continue monitoring rate
   - start digoxin for better rate control, monitor and replete K as
   needed
   -contraindication to anticoagulation as patient has had hx of recent GI
   bleed [**2-11**] to gastric ulcer
   # Low grade fevers:
   Likely due to above, but will send UA/UCx and f/u BCx in this
   diabetic.  Also note that he has a cough on exam, although he states
   this is a chronic cough for him, likely from bronchitis due to his long
   smoking history.
   .
   #  labile BP: HTN with transint episode of hypotension responsive to
   fluid bolus
   -initially received captopril [**2-11**] HTN in ER
   - hx. of HTN on home metoprolol- increased dose to 50mg TID for blood
   pressure and rate control
   ..
   # DM: poor control on SSI
   - patient
s outpatient medication held on hospitalization
   - added glargine 5 Units daily, adjust as needed to maintain euglycemia
   # CAD s/p CABG:
   - continue ASA, statin
   - ACE inhibitor on hold for now
   .
   # PVD: holding cilostazol as non-formulary med
   .
   # Question of thyroid nodule:  Per review of OSH records.
   - will check TFTs
   - follow up as outpatient
   .
   # Tobacco abuse:
   - counsel regarding tobacco cessation
   - offer nicotine patch
   - continue advair for ?? COPD; will not order equivalent of formoterol
   or mom[**Name (NI) **] as he has beta agonist and steroid in advair
   .
   # Likely dyslipidemia:
   Not on problem list from OSH records, but on statin and gemfibrozil.
   -restarted simvastatin, holding gemfibrozil until LFTs improve
   .
   # Likely BPH:  hold terazosin for now in case his BP begins to drop
   from cholangitis, but will monitor
   .
   # Anemia:  current hct 33, baseline hct not known
   - check iron studies, retics, peripheral smear
   - active type and screen given h/o GI bleed
   - stool is guaiac negative
   - monitor
   .
   # h/o Prostate CA:  resolved, per pt

   Code status:
   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, who presented to the hospital with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and obstructive liver function tests (LFTs) concerning for cholangitis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: SpO2 94% on nasal cannula oxygen, with atrial fibrillation (AFib) and a mildly elevated troponin level.
* Cardiovascular: AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR), treated with diltiazem and metoprolol.
* Gastrointestinal: Cholecystitis, calcified, with a recent ERCP procedure and stent placement.
* Renal: Normal creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels.
* Hematology: Anemia, with a current hematocrit (Hct) of 33%.
* Endocrine: Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, treated with glargine and sliding scale insulin (SSI).
* Medications: Unasyn (ampicillin-sulbactam) for cholangitis, metoprolol for AFib, and omeprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: AFib with RVR may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, or even cardiogenic shock.
2. Gastrointestinal complications: Cholangitis may lead to sepsis, multiorgan failure, or further complications such as cholecystitis or pancreatitis.
3. Renal complications: Acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) may occur due to sepsis, hypotension, or nephrotoxic medications.
4. Hematological complications: Anemia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding, hemolysis, or bone marrow suppression.
5. Endocrine complications: Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus may lead to hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, or even diabetic coma.
6. Medication-related complications: Unasyn may cause allergic reactions, and metoprolol may worsen heart failure or exacerbate bradycardia.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status, and adjust his medications and treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage potential complications."

   cholescystitis.  Empirical Unasyn.  Clinically improved.
   A-FIB -- [**Last Name **] problem.  Dilated [**Name2 (NI) **] by echo, mild AS.  Control rate with
   lopressor.  [**Month (only) 51**] require Digoxin if b-blocker not effective.  Consider
   Cardiiology consultation.  Consider anticoagulation.
   CAD
 likely accounts for troponin leak (likely demand ischemia from
   flash pulmonary eema), although cannot exclude primary ischemia.  Will
   require cardiac clearance prior to surgery.
   RESP DISTRESS -- attributed to acute pulmonary edema.  Clinically
   resolved.  Continue usual meds including lasix.
   RUQ PAIN -- attributed to cholecystitits, choledocholithiasis --> may
   have passed stone based on clinical symptoms and LFTs.  General Surgery
   evaluated and following.   ERCP team to evaluate.  Pt. indicates he
   wishes to have surgery in VAH.
   FLUIDS --  replete.  Monitor I/O.  Desire net negative fluid balance.
   ELEVATED LFTs -- replete to K >4.0.
   ELEVATED LIPASE -- evidence for pancreatits (chemical).  Improved.
   Advance diet as approved per Surgery.
   NIDDM
 maintain control, maintain <150.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib), sepsis, cholecystitis, and cholangitis. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 106 beats per minute, blood pressure of 86/51 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 25 inspirations per minute. The patient has a fever, chills, and elevated white blood cell count, which suggests sepsis. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, and the patient has a history of pancreatitis. The patient's mental status is altered, and they are at risk for hypokalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest that the sepsis is likely caused by an infection. The patient's unstable vital signs and altered mental status are also indicative of sepsis.
2. Cholangitis: The patient's cholangitis is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. The patient's elevated LFTs and history of pancreatitis suggest that the cholangitis is likely caused by a bile duct obstruction.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. The patient's heart rate is unstable, and the patient's blood pressure is low, which suggests that the atrial fibrillation is causing hemodynamic instability.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. The patient's elevated LFTs and history of pancreatitis suggest that the pancreatitis is likely caused by a bile duct obstruction.
5. Hypokalemia: The patient's hypokalemia is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. The patient's low potassium levels suggest that the patient is at risk for cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
6. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. The patient's respiratory rate is unstable, and the patient's oxygen saturation is low, which suggests that the patient is at risk for respiratory failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Administer antibiotics to treat the patient's sepsis.
3. Perform an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to evaluate the patient's bile ducts and treat any obstructions.
4. Administer medications to control the patient's atrial fibrillation.
5. Monitor the patient's potassium levels closely and administer potassium supplements as necessary.
6. Provide respiratory support to the patient as necessary.
7. Consult with a cardiologist and a gastroenterologist to develop a comprehensive treatment plan for the patient."

   Assessment and Plan
   Cholecycstitis, cholangitits.
   SEPSIS -- fevers, chills, elevated WBC --> concern for cholangitis,
   cholescystitis.  Empirical Unasyn.  Clinically improved.
   A-FIB -- [**Last Name **] problem.  Dilated [**Name2 (NI) **] by echo, mild AS.  Control rate with
   lopressor.  [**Month (only) 51**] require Digoxin if b-blocker not effective.  Consider
   Cardiiology consultation.  Consider anticoagulation.
   CAD
 likely accounts for troponin leak (likely demand ischemia from
   flash pulmonary eema), although cannot exclude primary ischemia.  Will
   require cardiac clearance prior to surgery.
   RESP DISTRESS -- attributed to acute pulmonary edema.  Clinically
   resolved.  Continue usual meds including lasix.
   RUQ PAIN -- attributed to cholecystitits, choledocholithiasis --> may
   have passed stone based on clinical symptoms and LFTs.  General Surgery
   evaluated and following.   ERCP team to evaluate.  Pt. indicates he
   wishes to have surgery in VAH.
   FLUIDS --  replete.  Monitor I/O.  Desire net negative fluid balance.
   ELEVATED LFTs -- replete to K >4.0.
   ELEVATED LIPASE -- evidence for pancreatits (chemical).  Improved.
   Advance diet as approved per Surgery.
   NIDDM
 maintain control, maintain <150.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- resolved.  Likely related to medications
   (narcotics)
   THYROID NODULE

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with the following conditions:

1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's mental status has deteriorated, and they are agitated, refusing to speak with physicians or family members. They received Haldol and Ativan to manage their agitation.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient's heart rhythm is in AFIB, with a heart rate of 102 bpm.
3. Cholecystitis, Calculous: The patient has a history of gallstones, and their condition is being managed in the ICU.
4. Cholecystitis, Acalculous: The patient has a diagnosis of acalculous cholecystitis, likely related to their underlying condition.
5. Respiratory Support: The patient is receiving nasal cannula oxygen therapy with an SpO2 of 98%.
6. Hemodynamic Monitoring: The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, blood pressure of 157/82 mmHg, and heart rate of 102 bpm.
7. Fluid Balance: The patient has received 1,270 mL of fluids and has a total output of 1,530 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 260 mL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's AFIB may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or stroke.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support may increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or respiratory failure.
3. Infectious complications: The patient's cholecystitis may lead to sepsis or organ failure if not managed promptly.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's cholecystitis may lead to pancreatitis, abscess formation, or bowel obstruction.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's delirium and agitation may worsen, leading to increased risk of falls, fractures, or other injuries.

It is essential to continue close monitoring of the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of RUQ pain and obstructive liver function tests (LFTs) concerning for cholangitis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 157/82 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. His respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 10.2-13.4 K/uL
* Hematocrit (Hct): 28.5-34.2%
* Platelet count (Plt): 130-273 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.4-1.0 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01-0.03 ng/mL
* Glucose: 72-114 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.5 g/dL
* LDH: 309 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 1.8 mg/dL

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Cholangitis: The patient's clinical presentation is concerning for cholangitis, which is a potentially life-threatening condition. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, which may indicate ongoing cholangitis.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (Afib): The patient has developed Afib, which may increase his risk of cardiac complications. The patient's blood pressure has been labile, and he has experienced episodes of hypotension.
3. Low-grade fevers: The patient has developed low-grade fevers, which may be due to his underlying medical conditions or a secondary infection.
4. Labile blood pressure: The patient's blood pressure has been labile, with episodes of hypertension and hypotension. This may be due to his underlying medical conditions or medications.
5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is 33%, which may indicate anemia. The patient's iron studies, reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear should be checked to determine the cause of anemia.
6. Possible thyroid nodule: The patient has a question of thyroid nodule, which should be evaluated further with thyroid function tests (TFTs).
7. Tobacco abuse: The patient has a history of tobacco abuse, which may increase his risk of respiratory complications.
8. Dyslipidemia: The patient has likely dyslipidemia, which should be managed with statins and other lipid-lowering medications.
9. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): The patient has a history of BPH, which may cause urinary retention or other complications.

In summary, the patient has a complex medical history with several potential complications, including cholangitis, Afib, low-grade fevers, labile blood pressure, anemia, possible thyroid nodule, tobacco abuse, dyslipidemia, and BPH. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, which may indicate ongoing cholangitis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he requires close monitoring to prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with a history of CAD, HTN, and DM who presented to the ER with RUQ pain and obstructive LFTs concerning for cholangitis. He underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement, and his clinical condition has improved. He is currently in the ICU due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, labile blood pressure, and anemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, and blood pressure of 157/82 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula. His lab results show elevated liver enzymes, anemia, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The patient is receiving various medications, including metoprolol, diltiazem, and heparin, and is being monitored closely for potential complications.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cholangitis: The patient's RUQ pain and elevated LFTs suggest a possibility of cholangitis, which may lead to sepsis, organ failure, or death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate may lead to tachycardia, hypertension, and decreased cardiac output, which can result in cardiac failure or stroke.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not treated promptly, leading to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Hypertension: The patient's labile blood pressure may lead to end-organ damage, including kidney damage, if not controlled effectively.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GI bleed and ongoing anemia make him at risk for further bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
6. Infection: The patient's presence in the ICU and his underlying medical conditions make him at risk for infection, which can be life-threatening.
7. Pulmonary complications: The patient's respiratory support and oxygen therapy may lead to respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and clinical condition closely.
2. Administer antibiotics as needed to treat potential infections.
3. Adjust the patient's medication regimen as necessary to manage his atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and anemia.
4. Consider further diagnostic testing, such as endoscopy or imaging studies, to evaluate the patient's RUQ pain and elevated LFTs.
5. Consult with a cardiologist to further evaluate and manage the patient's atrial fibrillation.
6. Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist to evaluate and manage the patient's cholangitis and anemia.
7. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust his diet and supplements as necessary to prevent malnutrition and dehydration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with a history of CAD, HTN, and DM, who was admitted to the ICU with RUQ pain and obstructive LFTs concerning for cholangitis. He underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement, and is clinically improved. The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, and has had a recent episode of hypotension responsive to fluid bolus. He has a history of GI bleed, and is on prophylactic anticoagulation. The patient is also experiencing low-grade fevers, labile blood pressure, and anemia. He has a history of CAD, HTN, DM, and PVD, and is taking various medications, including metoprolol, diltiazem, and statin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cholangitis: The patient's condition is still concerning for cholangitis, and he needs to be closely monitored for signs of worsening infection, such as fever, chills, and abdominal pain.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is likely to be paroxysmal, and he needs to be monitored for signs of worsening heart rate and rhythm. He is also at risk for stroke, and anticoagulation therapy may be considered in the future.
3. Hypotension: The patient's recent episode of hypotension responsive to fluid bolus suggests that he may be at risk for further episodes of hypotension, particularly if his blood pressure is not adequately controlled.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely to be due to chronic blood loss, and he needs to be monitored for signs of worsening anemia, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and pale skin.
5. GI Bleed: The patient's history of GI bleed suggests that he may be at risk for further bleeding episodes, particularly if his anticoagulation therapy is not adequately controlled.
6. PVD: The patient's history of PVD suggests that he may be at risk for further episodes of PVD, particularly if his blood pressure is not adequately controlled.
7. DM: The patient's poor control of DM suggests that he may be at risk for further complications, such as nephropathy and retinopathy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function tests, and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's blood glucose levels, and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.
4. Consider anticoagulation therapy to reduce the risk of stroke and deep vein thrombosis.
5. Consider further testing, such as echocardiogram and stress test, to evaluate the patient's cardiac function and risk of further cardiac complications.
6. Consider further testing, such as colonoscopy and endoscopy, to evaluate the patient's gastrointestinal tract and risk of further bleeding episodes.
7. Consider further testing, such as kidney function tests, to evaluate the patient's kidney function and risk of further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Cholecycstitis, cholangitits.  A-fib.
   SEPSIS -- Cholangitis, cholescystitis.  Empirical Unasyn.  Clinically
   improved.
   A-FIB -- [**Last Name **] problem.  Dilated [**Name2 (NI) **] by echo, mild AS.  Control rate with
   lopressor.  Consider anticoagulation.
   CAD
 likely accounts for troponin leak (likely demand ischemia from
   flash pulmonary eema), although cannot exclude primary ischemia.  Will
   require cardiac clearance prior to surgery.
   DELERIUM -- ICU psychosis vs. EtOH.  Good response to haldol and
   ativan.  Monitor.
   RESP DISTRESS -- attributed to acute pulmonary edema.  Clinically
   resolved.  Continue usual meds including lasix.
   RUQ PAIN -- attributed to cholecystitits, choledocholithiasis --> may
   have passed stone based on clinical symptoms and LFTs.  General Surgery
   evaluated and following.    Pt. indicates he wishes to have surgery in
   VAH.
   FLUIDS --  replete.  Monitor I/O.  Desire net negative fluid balance.
   ELEVATED LFTs -- replete to K >4.0.
   ELEVATED LIPASE -- evidence for pancreatits (chemical).  Improved.
   Advance diet as approved per Surgery.
   NIDDM
 maintain control, maintain <150.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- resolved.  Likely related to medications
   (narcotics)
   THYROID NODULE
 needs outpatient follow up.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K >4.0

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Cholecycstitis, cholangitits.  A-fib.
   SEPSIS -- Cholangitis, cholescystitis.  Empirical Unasyn.  Clinically
   improved.
   A-FIB -- [**Last Name **] problem.  Dilated [**Name2 (NI) **] by echo, mild AS.  Control rate with
   lopressor.  Consider anticoagulation.
   CAD
 likely accounts for troponin leak (likely demand ischemia from
   flash pulmonary eema), although cannot exclude primary ischemia.  Will
   require cardiac clearance prior to surgery.
   DELERIUM -- ICU psychosis vs. EtOH.  Good response to haldol and
   ativan.  Monitor.
   RESP DISTRESS -- attributed to acute pulmonary edema.  Clinically
   resolved.  Continue usual meds including lasix.

Summary:

The patient is a 86-year-old male admitted to the ICU with cholecystitis and cholangitis. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is being treated with anticoagulation. He has also been experiencing delirium, which has responded to treatment with haloperidol and lorazepam. His respiratory status is stable, but he has had a recent episode of acute pulmonary edema. He has a history of coronary artery disease and is being monitored for cardiac clearance prior to surgery. His liver function tests are elevated, and he has been diagnosed with pancreatitis. He is also being treated for hyperglycemia and hypokalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is being treated with empirical antibiotics, but the infection may not be fully resolved, and there is a risk of further complications.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation is being treated with anticoagulation, but there is a risk of further cardiac complications, such as stroke or cardiac arrest.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's recent episode of acute pulmonary edema may be a sign of underlying respiratory disease, and there is a risk of further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's pancreatitis may not be fully resolved, and there is a risk of further gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or obstruction.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's delirium may not be fully resolved, and there is a risk of further neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.
6. Infection: The patient's cholecystitis and cholangitis may not be fully resolved, and there is a risk of further infection, such as sepsis or abscesses.
7. Nutritional Complications: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and there is a risk of further nutritional complications, such as malnutrition or electrolyte imbalances.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a range of medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications."
