   Assessment and Plan
   60M with ESRD on HD, CAD, DM, atrial arrhythmia, CHF, presenting with
   shortness of breath and chest pain in setting of cocaine abuse and
   missing hemodialysis.
   .
   # Chest pain. Differential includes ACS, cocaine induced chest pain,
   pericarditis versus costacondiritis. Unlikely ACS as recent cath [**2155**]
   no CAD (however could be cocaine induced ischemia), no acute changes on
   EKG and was recently admitted with negative rule out. Pain is not
   positional and no changes on EKG to suggest pericarditis. Pain is not
   reproducible to palpation to suggest costachondritis. Most likely
   cocaine induced chest pain based on recent use and prior history.
   - ROMI
   - Continue statin; hold ACEI with increased K. Received ASA by EMS,
   continue 81 mg daily
   - BP control/decrease of myocardial demand with HD in AM
   - For pain control dilaudid, percocet and benzodiazepines prn
   - Encourage cessation of cocaine abuse
   .
   # Hypoxia. Volume overload with pulmonary edema and effusions in
   setting of not getting HD. No evidence of pneumonia currently, though
   does have productive cough. History most consistent with volume
   overload, unlikely PE.
   - HD in AM
   - Attempt to wean off 100% NRB
   - Can repeat CXR after diuresis if still with hypoxia or cough
   - Diuresis with lasix
   - Hold off on antibiotics as no fever, no leukocytosis; likely volume
   overload given clinical history
   .
   # Tachycardia/Aflutter. Patient with baseline Aflutter; currently
   demonstrating 2:1 conduction. Patient required diltiazem 10 mg IV for
   HR 170s.
   - Avoid BBs due to history of cocaine use.
   - Convert long acting po diltiazem to short acting
   - If poorly controlled IV diltiazem or drip prn
   - Cannot anticoagulate long term given GIBs per past notes..
   .
   # Hyperkalemia. With ESRD and poor adherence to HD. No peaked t waves
   on EKG.  Received dose of Kayexelate.
   - Monitor on tele.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), Diabetes Mellitus (DM), atrial arrhythmia, and Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). He presented with shortness of breath and chest pain in the setting of cocaine abuse and missing hemodialysis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tachycardic, with a heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 161/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on high-flow nebulizer.
* Physical examination: The patient is oriented, with no signs of respiratory distress. He has bilateral ronchi 1/2 up lung, tachycardic, and normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. His abdomen is soft, mildly distended, and bowel sounds are present. His extremities are well-perfused, with 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
* Laboratory results: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and troponin-T level. His creatinine level is 9.9 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 182 mg/dL.
* Imaging studies: The patient has bilateral airspace opacities on chest X-ray, likely due to pulmonary edema and superimposed infection.

The patient is at risk for the following potential medical complications:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may worsen his cardiac condition, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or even cardiac arrest.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's bilateral ronchi and pulmonary edema may worsen his respiratory status, leading to respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
* Infectious complications: The patient's superimposed infection may lead to sepsis, septic shock, or organ failure.
* Renal complications: The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) may worsen his underlying chronic kidney disease (CKD), leading to further electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's diabetes and CKD may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as diarrhea, constipation, or malabsorption.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Hemodialysis in the morning
* Diltiazem for hypertension and tachycardia
* Hydromorphone for pain control
* Lasix for diuresis
* Kayexelate for hyperkalemia
* Calcium, insulin, and D50 for ECG changes
* Glucose control to encourage intracellular entry
* Hold ACEI
* Continue statin, hold ACEI with increased K
* Continue renagel/nephrocaps/renal diet
* SW consult for depression and cocaine abuse
* Subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications, and to optimize his cardiac, respiratory, and renal function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with ESRD on HD, CAD, DM, atrial arrhythmia, and CHF. He was admitted with shortness of breath and chest pain, which is likely related to cocaine-induced chest pain. The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has a history of volume overload with pulmonary edema and effusions, which is likely related to his missed hemodialysis. He is currently on 4L nasal cannula and is being treated with high-flow nebs.
2. Tachycardia/Aflutter: The patient has a baseline atrial flutter, which is currently demonstrating 2:1 conduction. He was treated with IV diltiazem 10 mg for a heart rate of 170s.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has ESRD and poor adherence to HD, which has led to hyperkalemia. He is being monitored on tele and will receive HD in the morning.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is secondary to volume overload. He is being treated with diltiazem 60 mg QID and will start a nitro drip if his blood pressure is poorly controlled.
5. ESRD on HD: The patient is overdue for HD and will receive it in the morning.
6. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is being referred for a social work consultation.
7. Cocaine abuse: The patient has a history of cocaine abuse and is being referred for a social work consultation.
8. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has an anion gap of 18, which is likely related to his renal failure from CKD.
9. Diabetes: The patient has DM and is being treated with an insulin sliding scale.
10. Fluid overload: The patient has a history of fluid overload and is being treated with diuretics.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and fluid overload can lead to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia and atrial flutter can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening.
3. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD and hyperkalemia can lead to further renal failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient's hypoxia and fluid overload can lead to sepsis.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GIBs and use of anticoagulants can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Infection: The patient's history of pneumonia and use of antibiotics can lead to infection.
7. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's pericarditis and use of anticoagulants can lead to cardiac tamponade.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his medical complications to prevent further deterioration of his condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   60M with ESRD on HD, CAD, DM, atrial arrhythmia, CHF, presenting with
   shortness of breath and chest pain in setting of cocaine abuse and
   missing hemodialysis.
   # Chest pain
   Likely angina with some myocardial ischemia, not severe enough for
   enzyme leak. Although PNA unlikely, may be pleuritic component (less
   likely)
   - Continue statin; hold ACEI with increased K. Received ASA by EMS,
   continue 81 mg daily
   - BP control/decrease of myocardial demand
   - For pain control dilaudid, percocet and benzodiazepines prn
   - Encourage cessation of cocaine abuse
   # Hypoxia
   Missed HD with significant volume overload. Superimposed infection not
   obvious on CXR, but possible given rising WBC and productive cough. PE
   on differential but alternate explanations adequate.
   - HD and diuresis
   - Attempt to wean respiratory support (no n.c.)
   - Hold off on antibiotics as no fever, no leukocytosis; likely volume
   overload given clinical history
   # Tachycardia/Aflutter
   Patient with baseline Aflutter; often demonstrating 2:1 conduction.
   Patient required diltiazem 10 mg IV for HR 170s.
   - Avoid BBs due to history of cocaine use.
   - Convert back to long-acting dilt. on discharge
   - Cannot anticoagulate long term given GIBs per past notes.
   # Hyperkalemia/hyperphsophatemia
   With ESRD and poor adherence to HD.
   - Tele for now (and likely on floor depending on events in record)
   - Continue HD
   - If ECG changes (peaked Ts) develop, give calcium, insulin and D50
   - Glucose control to encourage intracellular entry
   - Hold ACEI
   # Hypertension
   Secondary to volume overload.
   - Avoid BB due to cocaine use
   - Diltiazem 60 mg QID
   - If poorly controlled 190s or greater start nitro drip
   # ESRD on HD
   Overdue for HD as above.
   - HD again today
   - Managment of K
   - Continue renagel/nephrocaps/renal diet
   # Depression
   Concerning that missed HD - recent admission for similar complaints.
   - SW consult.
   # Cocaine abuse
   [**Last Name **] problem for patient.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   60M with ESRD on HD, CAD, DM, atrial arrhythmia, CHF, presenting with
   shortness of breath and chest pain in setting of cocaine abuse and
   missing hemodialysis.
   # Chest pain
   Likely angina with some myocardial ischemia, not severe enough for
   enzyme leak. Although PNA unlikely, may be pleuritic component (less
   likely)
   - Continue statin; hold ACEI with increased K. Received ASA by EMS,
   continue 81 mg daily
   - BP control/decrease of myocardial demand
   - For pain control dilaudid, percocet and benzodiazepines prn
   - Encourage cessation of cocaine abuse
   # Hypoxia
   Missed HD with significant volume overload. Superimposed infection not
   obvious on CXR, but possible given rising WBC and productive cough. PE
   on differential but alternate explanations adequate.
   - HD and diuresis
   - Attempt to wean respiratory support (no n.c.)
   - Hold off on antibiotics as no fever, no leukocytosis; likely volume
   overload given clinical history
   # Tachycardia/Aflutter
   Patient with baseline Aflutter; often demonstrating 2:1 conduction.
   Patient required diltiazem 10 mg IV for HR 170s.
   - Avoid BBs due to history of cocaine use.
   - Convert back to long-acting dilt. on discharge
   - Cannot anticoagulate long term given GIBs per past notes.
   # Hyperkalemia/hyperphsophatemia
   With ESRD and poor adherence to HD.
   - Tele for now (and likely on floor depending on events in record)
   - Continue HD
   - If ECG changes (peaked Ts) develop, give calcium, insulin and D50
   - Glucose control to encourage intracellular entry
   - Hold ACEI
   # Hypertension
   Secondary to volume overload.
   - Avoid BB due to cocaine use
   - Diltiazem 60 mg QID
   - If poorly controlled 190s or greater start nitro drip
   # ESRD on HD
   Overdue for HD as above.
   - HD again today
   - Managment of K
   - Continue renagel/nephrocaps/renal diet
   # Depression
   Concerning that missed HD - recent admission for similar complaints.
   - SW consult.
   # Cocaine abuse
   [**Last Name **] problem for patient.

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis who missed his dialysis treatment and took cocaine. He is experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. His lab results indicate hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and metabolic acidosis. His chest X-ray shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, which may be related to his cocaine use or volume overload.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to his poor peripheral circulation, and his neurologic examination is also limited due to his tachycardia and hypertension.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Myocardial infarction or ischemia: The patient's chest pain and tachycardia may indicate cardiac complications.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray may indicate pneumonia.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia may indicate respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia and atrial arrhythmia may indicate cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Sepsis: The patient's rising white blood cell count and fever may indicate sepsis.
6. Volume overload: The patient's fluid overload and hypertension may indicate volume overload.
7. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD and missed dialysis treatment may indicate worsening renal failure.
8. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion gap and lactate levels may indicate metabolic acidosis.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Hemodialysis: The patient will receive hemodialysis to manage his fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Antibiotics: The patient will receive antibiotics to treat any potential infections.
3. Pain management: The patient will receive pain management to alleviate his chest pain.
4. Cardiovascular management: The patient will receive cardiovascular management to manage his tachycardia and hypertension.
5. Electrolyte management: The patient will receive electrolyte management to manage his hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia.
6. Respiratory support: The patient will receive respiratory support to manage his tachypnea and hypoxia.
7. Cardiovascular prophylaxis: The patient will receive cardiovascular prophylaxis to prevent cardiac complications.
8. Renal diet: The patient will receive a renal diet to manage his ESRD.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to address his multiple medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   60M with ESRD on HD, CAD, DM, atrial arrhythmia, CHF, presenting with
   shortness of breath and chest pain in setting of cocaine abuse and
   missing hemodialysis.
   # Chest pain
   Likely angina with some myocardial ischemia, not severe enough for
   enzyme leak. Although PNA unlikely, may be pleuritic component (less
   likely)
   - Continue statin; hold ACEI with increased K. Received ASA by EMS,
   continue 81 mg daily
   - BP control/decrease of myocardial demand
   - For pain control dilaudid, percocet and benzodiazepines prn
   - Encourage cessation of cocaine abuse
   # Hypoxia
   Missed HD with significant volume overload. Superimposed infection not
   obvious on CXR, but possible given rising WBC and productive cough. PE
   on differential but alternate explanations adequate.
   - HD (next session tomorrow) and diuresis
   - Attempt to wean respiratory support (no n.c.)
   - Hold off on antibiotics as no fever, no leukocytosis; likely volume
   overload given clinical history
   # Tachycardia/Aflutter
   Patient with baseline Aflutter; often demonstrating 2:1 conduction.
   Patient required diltiazem 10 mg IV for HR 170s.
   - Avoid BBs due to history of cocaine use.
   - Convert back to long-acting dilt. on discharge
   - Cannot anticoagulate long term given GIBs per past notes.
   # Hyperkalemia/hyperphsophatemia
   With ESRD and poor adherence to HD.
   - Tele for now (and likely on floor depending on events in record)
   - Continue HD
   - If ECG changes (peaked Ts) develop, give calcium, insulin and D50
   - Glucose control to encourage intracellular entry
   - Hold ACEI
   # Hypertension
   Secondary to volume overload.
   - Avoid BB due to cocaine use
   - Diltiazem 60 mg QID
   - If poorly controlled 190s or greater start nitro drip
   # ESRD on HD
   Overdue for HD as above.
   - HD again today
   - Managment of K
   - Continue renagel/nephrocaps/renal diet
   # Asterixis and Mental Status
   Typical DDx with asterixis include hypercarbia, uremia and hepatic
   encephalopathy. Each also produce mental status changes. He is somewhat
   inattentive. Most likely uremic
   - Follow
   # Cocaine abuse
   [**Last Name **] problem for patient.
   - SW consult.
   # Metabolic acidosis.
   Anion gap 21. Lactate normal. Likely secondary to renal failure from

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who missed a dialysis session and took cocaine, presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial arrhythmia, and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's vital signs are stable, but the patient is tachycardic, with a heart rate of 107 bpm. The patient has a pulmonary infiltrate on chest X-ray and a white blood cell count that is trending up.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Myocardial Ischemia: The patient's chest pain and tachycardia may indicate myocardial ischemia, which can lead to myocardial infarction if not managed promptly.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pulmonary infiltrate on chest X-ray may indicate pneumonia, which can worsen respiratory status and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Volume Overload: The patient's missed dialysis session and fluid overload may lead to further volume overload, which can exacerbate cardiovascular and respiratory symptoms.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's ESRD and poor adherence to HD may lead to hyperkalemia, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's anion gap of 21 and lactate levels within normal range may indicate metabolic acidosis, which can worsen respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms.
6. Asterixis and Mental Status Changes: The patient's asterixis and mental status changes may indicate uremic encephalopathy, which can worsen cognitive function and increase the risk of falls and other complications.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia may indicate respiratory failure, which can worsen cardiovascular and neurological symptoms.
8. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia and atrial arrhythmia may worsen cardiac arrhythmias, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrest and other complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient is a 24-hour-old admission to the ICU with a chief complaint of pulmonary edema. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, chronic kidney disease, and polysubstance abuse. The patient was found to have dietary noncompliance, skipped dialysis, and cocaine abuse, which contributed to the development of pulmonary edema.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.7°F)
* Heart rate: 109 bpm (normal range: 101-109 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 133/73 mmHg (normal range: 119-158/43-105 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (normal range: 15-37 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 100% (normal range: 95-100%)

The patient's physical examination revealed:

* General appearance: Well-nourished, thin
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds
* Respiratory/Chest: Diminished breath sounds with a squeak in the right lower lung field
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds present
* Skin: Warm
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.4 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 11.8 K/uL
* Platelet count: 182 K/uL
* Creatinine: 9.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.23 ng/mL
* Glucose: 134 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Pulmonary edema: Dietary noncompliance, skipped dialysis, and cocaine abuse are contributing factors. The patient requires supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula and continues to require fluid removal.
* Renal failure, chronic: The patient has chronic kidney disease and requires ongoing dialysis.
* Pain control: The patient has chronic pain and a history of polysubstance abuse.
* Hyperkalemia: Resolved.
* Tachycardia/flutter: In normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and continues on the current regimen.
* Hypertension: Continues on the current regimen.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and tachypnea may lead to respiratory failure.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia and flutter may worsen or develop into more serious cardiac arrhythmias.
* Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and history of polysubstance abuse may increase the risk of infection.
* Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease and ongoing dialysis requirements may lead to further complications.
* Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen or develop into more serious complications, such as cardiac failure or stroke."
