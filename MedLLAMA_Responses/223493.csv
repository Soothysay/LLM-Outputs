You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status has improved, but they are still at risk for further deterioration due to their underlying conditions, such as multiple myeloma and immunocompromise.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass opacities on imaging, which may be indicative of pneumonia. Fungal infections, PCP, and non-bacterial pneumonias are on the differential diagnosis.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine has been steadily improving, but they are still at risk for further kidney damage due to their underlying conditions and medications.
4. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which may be contributing to their respiratory distress and other complications.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may be a sign of underlying cardiac issues or stress.
6. Bladder Pain: The patient is experiencing bladder pain, which may be related to their Foley catheter or other underlying conditions.
7. Left Eye Dilation: The patient has a dilated left pupil, which may be indicative of an underlying neurological issue.
8. CMV Viremia: The patient has CMV viremia, which may require further treatment and monitoring.
9. Multiple Myeloma: The patient has multiple myeloma, which is an underlying condition that may be contributing to their complications.
10. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which may be related to their underlying conditions or medications.
11. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which may require further treatment and monitoring.
12. Hypocalcemia: The patient has hypocalcemia, which may require further treatment and monitoring.
13. Immunosuppression: The patient is immunocompromised, which may increase their risk for infections and other complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue aggressive diuresis with Lasix to manage respiratory distress.
2. Monitor the patient's electrolytes and adjust their medications accordingly.
3. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for previously diagnosed HAP.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust their medications accordingly.
5. Consider urology consult for bladder pain.
6. Continue metoprolol for hypertension.
7. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider MRI brain if necessary.
8. Continue ganciclovir for CMV viremia.
9. Monitor the patient's platelet count and transfuse PRBCs as necessary.
10. Continue close monitoring and adjustment of renally dosed medications in setting of changing renal function.
11. Replete free water deficit for hypernatremia.
12. Continue IV BID PPI for GIB.
13. Monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust their medications accordingly.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their underlying conditions, medications, and potential complications to prevent further deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with multiple myeloma who has undergone allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and has developed multiple complications, including acute respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, veno-occlusive disease, febrile neutropenia, and CMV viremia. He is currently in the ICU with respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 110 bpm, and blood pressure of 139/96 mmHg. His respiratory status has improved over the past 24 hours, with a SpO2 of 100% on a face tent.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including diuresis with furosemide, low-dose morphine for pain, and aggressive pulmonary toilet. He is also receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for previously diagnosed hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and azithromycin for suspected PCP.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of multiple organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury (AKI), liver dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances. His complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 14.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 46 K/uL.

The patient's medical conditions include multiple myeloma, acute respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, veno-occlusive disease, febrile neutropenia, CMV viremia, and probable GVHD. He is also at risk for developing complications such as pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and stress ulcer bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate further, leading to respiratory failure and the need for more aggressive mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of multiple organ dysfunction increase his risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
3. Renal failure: The patient's AKI can worsen, leading to end-stage renal disease and the need for dialysis.
4. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver dysfunction can progress, leading to hepatic failure and the need for liver transplantation.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of multiple organ dysfunction increase his risk of developing infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
6. GVHD: The patient's GVHD can worsen, leading to multi-organ failure and death.
7. CMV disease: The patient's CMV viremia can progress, leading to CMV disease and multi-organ failure.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue aggressive diuresis with furosemide to manage fluid overload and AKI.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust mechanical ventilation as needed.
3. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for previously diagnosed HAP and azithromycin for suspected PCP.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte imbalances and adjust treatment as needed.
5. Continue immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD and CMV viremia.
6. Monitor the patient's liver and renal function closely and adjust treatment as needed.
7. Consider consults with infectious disease and gastroenterology specialists to optimize management of the patient's multiple organ dysfunction and potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with multiple myeloma who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and has since developed multiple complications, including acute respiratory failure (ARF), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), veno-occlusive disease (VOD), febrile neutropenia, and CMV viremia. He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to worsening respiratory status and was found to have pulmonary infiltrates and ground-glass opacities on imaging. He is currently receiving aggressive diuresis, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and antifungal therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status continues to deteriorate, and he requires ongoing mechanical ventilation and diuresis. There is a risk of further respiratory decline, including the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pulmonary infiltrates and ground-glass opacities may be indicative of pneumonia, which could be caused by bacterial, fungal, or viral pathogens. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, but the risk of developing antibiotic-resistant infections remains.
3. Sepsis: The patient's febrile neutropenia and CMV viremia increase his risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction and mortality.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of GIB and ongoing use of anticoagulant medications increase his risk of further gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be life-threatening.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may be contributing to his respiratory distress and requires ongoing management with antihypertensive medications.
6. Immunosuppression: The patient's immunosuppressive therapy and underlying disease state increase his risk of developing opportunistic infections, including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP).
7. Renal Failure: The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) requires ongoing monitoring and management, and there is a risk of further kidney damage or progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
8. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's ongoing diuresis and use of electrolyte-wasting medications increase his risk of developing electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia.
9. Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant medications and ongoing bleeding risk increase his risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
10. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressive therapy and underlying disease state increase his risk of developing infections, including bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with multiple myeloma who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and has developed multiple complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), febrile neutropenia, and CMV viremia. He was intubated and has been on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient has responded well to diuresis and is currently saturating well on a face tent.

The patient's respiratory status has been worsening over the past few days, with evolving pulmonary infiltrates and ground glass opacities on imaging. The patient is immunocompromised, and non-bacterial pneumonias such as fungal infection, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (PNA) are considered in the differential diagnosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and pneumonia is a possible complication. Fungal infection, PCP, and PNA are considered in the differential diagnosis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and respiratory failure is a potential complication.
3. Sepsis: The patient has febrile neutropenia, and sepsis is a possible complication.
4. CMV Disease: The patient has CMV viremia, and CMV disease is a potential complication.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and bleeding is a potential complication.
6. Renal Failure: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI), and renal failure is a potential complication.
7. Hypocalcemia: The patient has hypocalcemia, and calcium levels need to be monitored closely.
8. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, and antihypertensive medications are being continued.
9. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, and an MRI brain is being considered.
10. Immunosuppression: The patient is immunocompromised, and infections are a potential complication.

Recommendations:

1. Continue aggressive diuresis with Lasix to achieve a negative fluid balance.
2. Monitor electrolyte levels closely.
3. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and meropenem.
4. Consider prophylaxis for PCP.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust therapy as needed.
6. Continue antihypertensive medications.
7. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider an MRI brain if necessary.
8. Continue immunosuppressive therapy.
9. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust therapy as needed.
10. Consider removing the foley catheter and considering urology consult for bladder pain."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with multiple myeloma who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and has since developed multiple complications, including acute respiratory failure (ARF), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), veno-occlusive disease (VOD), febrile neutropenia, and CMV viremia. He was transferred to the MICU in respiratory distress due to worsening pulmonary infiltrates and ground glass opacities on imaging. He has responded well to diuresis and is currently on face tent with a FiO2 of 70%.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he may still require close monitoring and treatment to prevent further deterioration.
2. Bladder Pain: The patient's bladder pain may be related to bladder irritation from the foley catheter, and consideration should be given to removing the catheter or administering oxybutynin to alleviate symptoms.
3. Hypertension/Persistent Atrial Fibrillation/Tachycardia: The patient's hypertension and persistent atrial fibrillation may require continued treatment with metoprolol and consideration of other medications to control blood pressure.
4. GVHD/Immunsuppression: The patient's GVHD and immunosuppression may require continued treatment with methylprednisolone and cyclosporine, and close monitoring of his renal function.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be related to GVHD or other underlying conditions, and consideration should be given to performing an MRI brain to rule out other causes.
6. CMV Viremia: The patient's CMV viremia may require continued treatment with ganciclovir, and close monitoring of his viral load.
7. ARF: The patient's ARF may require continued close monitoring and treatment with diuretics and consideration of other medications to control blood pressure.
8. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia may require continued treatment with calcitriol and close monitoring of his calcium levels.
9. GIB: The patient's GIB may require continued monitoring of his hemoglobin levels and transfusion as needed.
10. FEN: The patient's FEN may require continued treatment with a low bacteria diet and supplements, and consideration of other medications to control symptoms.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 66-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxemic respiratory compromise, requiring non-invasive ventilation (NIV) support. He has undergone a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and has developed a fixed and dilated pupil on the left side, indicating potential neurologic complications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 129/85 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99%. He is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and diuretics, to manage his respiratory failure, possible infectious source, and fluid balance.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His liver enzymes, including alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, are elevated. His creatinine level is 1.9 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 24 mg/dL.

Imaging studies, including a chest X-ray, show suggestion of increased pulmonary edema in the upper lung fields, with some clearing in the lower lobes.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory compromise may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure.
2. Neurologic complications: The patient's fixed and dilated pupil may indicate a potential neurologic emergency, such as a stroke or brain hemorrhage.
3. Infections: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to the BMT, making him more susceptible to infections.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is critical, and fluid overload may lead to further complications, such as cardiac failure or respiratory distress.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential kidney damage or failure.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's respiratory failure and fluid overload may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, I recommend continued close monitoring and management of his respiratory failure, fluid balance, and neurologic status. The patient's medical team should also consider adjusting his medication regimen and fluid management to minimize the risk of further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma and acute hypoxia after bronch. He is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure, acute and chronic thrombocytopenia, and suspected infection versus pulmonary edema. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, and blood pressure of 129/86 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and has been on ventilator support. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. He is also receiving antibiotics, antifungals, and immunosuppressive therapy.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
2. Infection: The patient's suspected infection may progress to sepsis, leading to organ dysfunction and mortality.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory failure and cardiac complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's chronic thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding complications, especially if his platelet count drops further.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not managed properly, leading to cardiac complications and stroke.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant therapy may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status may worsen if he develops a neurological complication, such as stroke or seizures.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiovascular status may worsen if he develops a cardiovascular complication, such as heart failure or arrhythmia.
9. Infection control: The patient's infection may spread to other parts of his body, leading to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
10. Immunosuppression: The patient's immunosuppressive therapy may increase his risk of infection and malignancy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is a 66-year-old male who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCTx) approximately 60 days ago. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to hypoxia, infection versus pulmonary edema. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.5°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, and blood pressure of 129/86 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 100% on a face tent with 50% FiO2.

The patient has several medical conditions, including chronic thrombocytopenia, multiple myeloma, and tachycardia. He is also receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and immunosuppressants.

The patient's physical examination is notable for mydriasis, scrotal edema, and right and left leg edema. His respiratory examination reveals rhonchorous breath sounds. His neurological examination is limited due to his critical condition.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. His blood cultures are pending.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Thrombocytopenia, chronic: continue platelet transfusions as needed.
2. Multiple myeloma: continue treatment as directed by the oncologist.
3. Tachycardia, other: continue metoprolol as directed.
4. Respiratory failure, acute: continue diuresis and oxygen therapy as needed.
5. Hypoxia: continue to monitor oxygen saturation and adjust therapy as needed.
6. Bladder spasm: suspect foley malfunction as part of etiology and consider changing foley catheter.
7. Mydriasis: continue to monitor and reassess need for repeat MRI study.
8. HTN/Tachy: continue metoprolol as directed.
9. GVHD: continue immunosuppressive therapy as directed.
10. DISPO: discuss possibility of transferring to the floor today.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Infection: the patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central lines and catheters increase his risk of infection.
2. Pulmonary edema: the patient's respiratory failure and hypoxia increase his risk of developing pulmonary edema.
3. Bleeding: the patient's thrombocytopenia increases his risk of bleeding.
4. Neurological complications: the patient's mydriasis and limited neurological examination raise concerns about potential neurological complications.
5. Kidney injury: the patient's hypotension and decreased urine output increase his risk of kidney injury.
6. Sepsis: the patient's infection and immunosuppressed state increase his risk of developing sepsis.
7. Cardiovascular complications: the patient's tachycardia and hypertension increase his risk of cardiovascular complications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust therapy as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   d/c azithromycin and vanco today per ID as no evidence of MRSA or
   atypicals on micro
   -Continue atovaquone for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1694**]
   [**Name9 (PRE) 4837**] ganciclovir; await ID recs regarding dosing
   -F/u bronch fluid cultures and blood cultures
   - Wean off O2 as tolerated
   # Urinary retention:  Unclear why retaining with Foley in place.
   - Will ask urology to evaluate, ?replace Foley
   #) Bladder spasms: Spasms chronic x 1 month per wife with no relief on
   oxybutynin, ?related to urinary retention.
   -Assess response to anticholinergics
   -F/u urology recs
   #) Left eye dilation: Likely [**1-15**] ipratropium neb although less likey
   etiologies include aneurysm or orbital process
   - F/u final MRI read and neuro/ophtho recs
   #) Hypertension / PAF/ tachycardia
   -Resume home metoprolol 25mg tid
   #) GVHD/immunsuppression, had elevated bilirubin, thought to be due to
   GVHD. [**4-5**] RUQ u/s fairly unremarkable, no cholelithiasis or evidence
   of cholecystitis.
   -Methylprednisolone decreased [**4-11**]; continue at current dose
   -Cyclosporine decreased [**4-12**], monitor levels frequently in setting of
   rapidly changing renal function.
   #) Altered mental status
   -F/u MRI head
   #) CMV viremia: CMV titer relatively stable from [**4-3**] to [**4-9**]
   -Continue ganciclovir for now pending ID recs
   #) Multiple Myeloma: Getting 1U platelets this morning
   -Transfuse PRBCs for Hct <28 and platelets <50K
   #) ARF: Creatinine stable at 1.9, peaked at 6.2.  Monitor closely with
   initiation of standing lasix
   -F/u renal recs
   -Will need close monitoring and adjustment of renally dosed medications
   in setting of changing renal function
   #) Hypocalcemia: Repeat PTH from [**4-8**] elevated at 532
   -Continue calcitriol
   #) Hypernatremia
   -Replete free water deficit
   #) H/o GIB
   -Monitor hct

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   subsequent complications including ARF, GIB, VOD, febrile neutropenia,
   CMV viremia now transferred back to the MICU in respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory Distress: Evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass
   opacities on imaging in immunocompromised pt. Acutely decompensated and
   hypertensive after bronch, which may have precipitated pulm edema and
   resp distress in setting of imparied renal function.  Also on ddx as
   per initial pulm team are non-bacterial pneumonias such as fungal
   infection, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5655**] PNA. He has responded well in the last 24 hours
   to diuresis, and is now satting well on face tent.

   doses prn for daily goal >500cc negative
   -[**Hospital1 **] electrolytes check
   -Aggressive pulmonary toilet
   -Continue broad spectrum antibiotics meropenem and voriconazole; ok to
   d/c azithromycin and vanco today per ID as no evidence of MRSA or
   atypicals on micro
   -Continue atovaquone for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1694**]
   [**Name9 (PRE) 4837**] ganciclovir; await ID recs regarding dosing
   -F/u bronch fluid cultures and blood cultures
   - Wean off O2 as tolerated
   # Urinary retention:  Unclear why retaining with Foley in place.
   - Will ask urology to evaluate, ?replace Foley
   #) Bladder spasms: Spasms chronic x 1 month per wife with no relief on
   oxybutynin, ?related to urinary retention.
   -Assess response to anticholinergics
   -F/u urology recs
   #) Left eye dilation: Likely [**1-15**] ipratropium neb although less likey
   etiologies include aneurysm or orbital process
   - F/u final MRI read and neuro/ophtho recs
   #) Hypertension / PAF/ tachycardia
   -Resume home metoprolol 25mg tid
   #) GVHD/immunsuppression, had elevated bilirubin, thought to be due to
   GVHD. [**4-5**] RUQ u/s fairly unremarkable, no cholelithiasis or evidence
   of cholecystitis.
   -Methylprednisolone decreased [**4-11**]; continue at current dose
   -Cyclosporine decreased [**4-12**], monitor levels frequently in setting of
   rapidly changing renal function.
   #) Altered mental status
   -F/u MRI head
   #) CMV viremia: CMV titer relatively stable from [**4-3**] to [**4-9**]
   -Continue ganciclovir for now pending ID recs
   #) Multiple Myeloma: Getting 1U platelets this morning
   -Transfuse PRBCs for Hct <28 and platelets <50K
   #) ARF: Creatinine stable at 1.9, peaked at 6.2.  Monitor closely with
   initiation of standing lasix
   -F/u renal recs
   -Will need close monitoring and adjustment of renally dosed medications
   in setting of changing renal function
   #) Hypocalcemia: Repeat PTH from [**4-8**] elevated at 532
   -Continue calcitriol
   #) Hypernatremia
   -Replete free water deficit
   #) H/o GIB
   -Monitor hct
   -Transfuse per parameters above
   -Continue IV BID PPI

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with multiple myeloma who has undergone allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and has developed multiple complications, including acute respiratory failure (ARF), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), veno-occlusive disease (VOD), febrile neutropenia, and CMV viremia. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory distress.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues, including:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has developed evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass opacities on imaging, which may be due to non-bacterial pneumonias such as fungal infection, PCP, or PNA. He has responded well to diuresis and is now satting well on face tent.
2. Urinary Retention: The patient has been retaining urine despite having a Foley catheter in place. The cause is unclear, and the urology team has been consulted to evaluate and possibly replace the Foley catheter.
3. Bladder Spasms: The patient has been experiencing chronic bladder spasms for the past month, which have not responded to anticholinergic medication. The spasms may be related to urinary retention.
4. Left Eye Dilation: The patient's left pupil is fixed and dilated, which may be due to ipratropium neb, although other etiologies such as aneurysm or orbital process cannot be ruled out.
5. Hypertension/PAF/Tachycardia: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, and he has developed PAF and tachycardia. His home metoprolol has been resumed.
6. GVHD/Immunsuppression: The patient has developed GVHD, which has caused elevated bilirubin levels. He is being treated with methylprednisolone and cyclosporine.
7. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been altered, and an MRI head has been ordered to evaluate for any potential causes.
8. CMV Viremia: The patient has developed CMV viremia, which is being treated with ganciclovir.
9. Multiple Myeloma: The patient's multiple myeloma is being treated with platelet transfusions and close monitoring of his hematocrit and platelet count.
10. ARF: The patient's creatinine levels have stabilized, and he is being treated with diuresis and close monitoring of his renal function.
11. Hypocalcemia: The patient's PTH levels are elevated, and he is being treated with calcitriol.
12. Hypernatremia: The patient has developed hypernatremia, which is being treated by repleting his free water deficit.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Continue aggressive diuresis with Lasix 80mg IV bid.
2. Monitor electrolytes and adjust treatment as needed.
3. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal medication.
4. Wean off oxygen as tolerated.
5. Assess response to anticholinergic medication for bladder spasms.
6. F/u urology recs regarding Foley catheter replacement.
7. Resume home metoprolol 25mg tid.
8. Continue treatment for GVHD and immunsuppression.
9. F/u MRI head and neuro/ophtho recs regarding left eye dilation.
10. Continue treatment for CMV viremia and multiple myeloma.
11. Monitor renal function closely and adjust treatment as needed.
12. Replete free water deficit for hypernatremia.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending improvement in his oxygen requirement."

   subsequent complications including ARF, GIB, VOD, febrile neutropenia,
   CMV viremia now transferred back to the MICU in respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory Distress: Evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass
   opacities on imaging in immunocompromised pt. Acutely decompensated and
   hypertensive after bronch, which may have precipitated pulm edema and
   resp distress in setting of imparied renal function.  Also on ddx as
   per initial pulm team are non-bacterial pneumonias such as fungal
   infection, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5655**] PNA. He has responded well in the last 24 hours
   to diuresis, and is now satting well on face tent.  Bronch washing
   negative to date.   O2 requirement decreased to 3-4L NC.
   -holding off on diuresis as patient with tenuous BP in setting of
   narrow complex tachycardia.
   -[**Hospital1 **] electrolytes check
   -Aggressive pulmonary toilet
   -Vanc and azithro were stopped on [**2153-4-13**]
   -Continue atovaquone for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1694**]
   [**Name9 (PRE) 4837**] ganciclovir at current dose.
   -F/u bronch fluid cultures and blood cultures
   - Wean off O2 as tolerated
   #) Narrow complex tachycardia: Seems to have started after a severe
   bladder spasm.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be related to patient missing PL dose of
   metorpolol.  DDX for this patient is mainly between flutter or AVNRT.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be form of fib/flutter but patient mostly having discernable p
   waves.  Overnight management with metoprolol and dilt per overnight
   events above.  Patient remains of the dilt drip with a HR of < 100.
   -cont dilt gtt and wean as tolerated.  Will start PO dilt today.
   -ECG in am.
   #) Urinary retention:  Patient seems to be retaining as he has urine on
   bedside BS.  [**Month (only) 11**] be that clots are getting stuck in foley.
   - Per uro: obtain formal BS. If > 450 urine then will place larger
   foley with ability for CBI.
   #) Bladder spasms: Spasms chronic x 1 month per wife with no relief on
   oxybutynin, ?related to urinary retention.  Patient still having severe
   spasms, may have had a slight positive response to oxybutinin.
   -F/u urology recs
   -continue oxybutinin, valium and morphone IV for spasms.
   #) Left eye dilation: Likely [**1-15**] ipratropium neb although less likey
   etiologies include aneurysm or orbital process
   - F/u final MRI read and neuro/ophtho recs
   #) Hypertension / PAF/ tachycardia: currently weaning off dilt gtt.
   Will start PO dilt this am.
   #) GVHD/immunsuppression, had elevated bilirubin, thought to be due to
   GVHD. [**4-5**] RUQ u/s fairly unremarkable, no cholelithiasis or evidence
   of cholecystitis.
   -Methylprednisolone decreased [**4-11**]; continue at current dose
   -Cyclosporine decreased [**4-12**], monitor levels frequently in setting of
   rapidly changing renal function..  Dose currently at 25/25.
   #) Altered mental status
   -F/u MRI head
   #) CMV viremia: CMV titer relatively stable from [**4-3**] to [**4-9**]
   -Continue ganciclovir for now pending ID recs
   #) Multiple Myeloma: 1U platelets this morning
   -Transfuse PRBCs for Hct <28 and platelets <50K
   #) ARF: Creatinine stable at 1.9, peaked at 6.2.  Monitor closely with
   initiation of standing lasix
   -F/u renal recs
   -Will need close monitoring and adjustment of renally dosed medications
   in setting of changing renal function
   #) Hypocalcemia: Repeat PTH from [**4-8**] elevated at 532
   -Continue calcitriol
   #) Hypernatremia
   -Replete free water deficit
   #) H/o GIB
   -Monitor hct
   -Transfuse per parameters above
   -Continue IV BID PPI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with multiple myeloma, who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and has developed multiple complications, including acute respiratory failure (ARF), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), veno-occlusive disease (VOD), febrile neutropenia, and CMV viremia.

The patient was transferred back to the MICU in respiratory distress, with evolving pulmonary infiltrates and ground glass opacities on imaging. He has responded well to diuresis and is now saturating well on a face tent. The patient's O2 requirement has decreased to 3-4L NC.

The patient is experiencing several potential medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with evolving pulmonary infiltrates and ground glass opacities on imaging. He is requiring high-flow oxygen therapy and has responded well to diuresis.
2. Narrow Complex Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, and he is experiencing narrow complex tachycardia. The differential diagnosis includes atrial flutter or atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia.
3. Urinary Retention: The patient is experiencing urinary retention, with urine present on bedside bladder scan. The urologist recommends a formal bladder scan if the urine output is >450 mL.
4. Bladder Spasms: The patient is experiencing chronic bladder spasms, which may be related to urinary retention. He is receiving oxybutinin, valium, and morphine IV for symptom control.
5. Left Eye Dilation: The patient is experiencing left eye dilation, which may be related to ipratropium nebulization or other etiologies such as aneurysm or orbital process.
6. Hypertension/PAF/Tachycardia: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and he is experiencing tachycardia. He is being weaned off the diltiazem drip and will start PO diltiazem today.
7. GVHD/Immunosuppression: The patient has elevated bilirubin levels, which may be related to GVHD. He is receiving methylprednisolone and cyclosporine, and his dosage is being adjusted based on his renal function.
8. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be related to his underlying medical conditions. He is receiving methylprednisolone and cyclosporine, and his dosage is being adjusted based on his renal function.
9. CMV Viremia: The patient has CMV viremia, and his CMV titer is relatively stable. He is receiving ganciclovir, and his dosage is being adjusted based on his ID recommendations.
10. Multiple Myeloma: The patient has multiple myeloma, and his platelet count is low. He is receiving 1U platelets, and he will require further transfusions based on his platelet count and Hct.
11. ARF: The patient has acute renal failure, and his creatinine level is stable at 1.9. He is being monitored closely, and his dosage of renally dosed medications is being adjusted based on his renal function.
12. Hypocalcemia: The patient has hypocalcemia, and his PTH level is elevated. He is receiving calcitriol, and his dosage is being adjusted based on his calcium level.
13. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, and his free water deficit is being repleted.
14. H/o GIB: The patient has a history of GIB, and he is being monitored closely for signs of bleeding.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuing diuresis and monitoring his response to therapy.
2. Weaning off the diltiazem drip and starting PO diltiazem today.
3. Continuing oxybutinin, valium, and morphine IV for bladder spasms.
4. Obtaining a formal bladder scan if the urine output is >450 mL.
5. Monitoring the patient's mental status and adjusting his dosage of methylprednisolone and cyclosporine based on his renal function.
6. Continuing ganciclovir for CMV viremia.
7. Transfusing platelets and PRBCs as needed based on the patient's platelet count and Hct.
8. Monitoring the patient's renal function and adjusting his dosage of renally dosed medications based on his creatinine level.
9. Repleting free water deficit and monitoring the patient's electrolyte levels.
10. Continuing IV BID PPI for GIB.

The patient's disposition is pending stabilization of his HR and off diltiazem drip."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo man with multiple myeloma s/p allogenic SCT [**2153-2-9**] with multiple
   subsequent complications including ARF, GIB, VOD, febrile neutropenia,
   CMV viremia now transferred back to the MICU in respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory Distress: Evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass
   opacities on imaging in immunocompromised pt. Acutely decompensated and
   hypertensive after bronch, which may have precipitated pulm edema and
   resp distress in setting of imparied renal function.  Also on ddx as
   per initial pulm team are non-bacterial pneumonias such as fungal
   infection, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5655**] PNA. He has responded well in the last 24 hours
   to diuresis, and is now satting well on face tent.  Bronch washing
   negative to date.   O2 requirement decreased to 3-4L NC.
   -holding off on diuresis as patient with tenuous BP in setting of
   narrow complex tachycardia.
   -[**Hospital1 **] electrolytes check
   -Aggressive pulmonary toilet
   -Vanc and azithro were stopped on [**2153-4-13**]
   -Continue atovaquone for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1694**]
   [**Name9 (PRE) 4837**] ganciclovir at current dose.
   -F/u bronch fluid cultures and blood cultures
   - Wean off O2 as tolerated
   #) Narrow complex tachycardia: Seems to have started after a severe
   bladder spasm.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be related to patient missing PL dose of
   metorpolol.  DDX for this patient is mainly between flutter or AVNRT.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be form of fib/flutter but patient mostly having discernable p
   waves.  Overnight management with metoprolol and dilt per overnight
   events above.  Patient remains of the dilt drip with a HR of < 100.
   -cont dilt gtt and wean as tolerated.  Will start PO dilt today.
   -ECG in am.
   #) Urinary retention:  Patient seems to be retaining as he has urine on
   bedside BS.  [**Month (only) 11**] be that clots are getting stuck in foley.
   - Per uro: obtain formal BS. If > 450 urine then will place larger
   foley with ability for CBI.
   #) Bladder spasms: Spasms chronic x 1 month per wife with no relief on
   oxybutynin, ?related to urinary retention.  Patient still having severe
   spasms, may have had a slight positive response to oxybutinin.
   -F/u urology recs
   -continue oxybutinin, valium and morphone IV for spasms.
   #) Left eye dilation: Likely [**1-15**] ipratropium neb although less likey
   etiologies include aneurysm or orbital process
   - F/u final MRI read and neuro/ophtho recs
   #) Hypertension / PAF/ tachycardia: currently weaning off dilt gtt.
   Will start PO dilt this am.
   #) GVHD/immunsuppression, had elevated bilirubin, thought to be due to
   GVHD. [**4-5**] RUQ u/s fairly unremarkable, no cholelithiasis or evidence
   of cholecystitis.
   -Methylprednisolone decreased [**4-11**]; continue at current dose
   -Cyclosporine decreased [**4-12**], monitor levels frequently in setting of
   rapidly changing renal function..  Dose currently at 25/25.
   #) Altered mental status
   -F/u MRI head
   #) CMV viremia: CMV titer relatively stable from [**4-3**] to [**4-9**]
   -Continue ganciclovir for now pending ID recs
   #) Multiple Myeloma: 1U platelets this morning
   -Transfuse PRBCs for Hct <28 and platelets <50K
   #) ARF: Creatinine stable at 1.9, peaked at 6.2.  Monitor closely with
   initiation of standing lasix
   -F/u renal recs
   -Will need close monitoring and adjustment of renally dosed medications
   in setting of changing renal function
   #) Hypocalcemia: Repeat PTH from [**4-8**] elevated at 532
   -Continue calcitriol
   #) Hypernatremia
   -Replete free water deficit
   #) H/o GIB
   -Monitor hct
   -Transfuse per parameters above
   -Continue IV BID PPI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with multiple myeloma who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and has been experiencing multiple complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), veno-occlusive disease (VOD), febrile neutropenia, and CMV viremia. He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory distress and is currently receiving treatment for various conditions.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 106/81 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He is receiving oxygen therapy via a nasal cannula and has been placed on a diuresis regimen to manage his pulmonary edema.

The patient's medical history is significant for multiple myeloma, GIB, VOD, and CMV viremia, and he is currently receiving treatment for these conditions. He is also taking medications for hypertension, hypernatremia, and hypocalcemia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to ARDS, which is a common complication in patients with multiple myeloma who have undergone SCT. The patient's pulmonary infiltrates and ground glass opacities on imaging suggest that he may have developed pneumonia, which could be bacterial, fungal, or viral in origin.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is likely related to his underlying condition and may be exacerbated by his medications.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely related to his hypertension and may be a sign of cardiac instability.
4. Urinary retention: The patient's urinary retention is likely related to his underlying condition and may be exacerbated by his medications.
5. Bladder spasms: The patient's bladder spasms are likely related to his urinary retention and may be exacerbated by his medications.
6. Left eye dilation: The patient's left eye dilation is likely related to his underlying condition and may be a sign of orbital or neurologic involvement.
7. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia is likely related to his underlying condition and may be exacerbated by his medications.
8. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is likely related to his underlying condition and may be exacerbated by his medications.
9. GIB: The patient's GIB is likely related to his underlying condition and may be exacerbated by his medications.
10. CMV viremia: The patient's CMV viremia is likely related to his underlying condition and may be exacerbated by his medications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and adjust his medications as necessary to manage his respiratory distress, hypertension, and tachycardia.
2. Continue to manage the patient's urinary retention and bladder spasms with medications and urologic interventions as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's left eye dilation and orbital or neurologic involvement.
4. Continue to manage the patient's hypocalcemia and hypernatremia with medications and electrolyte management as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's GIB and adjust his medications and treatments as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's CMV viremia and adjust his medications and treatments as necessary.
7. Consider performing a bronchoscopy to evaluate the patient's pulmonary infiltrates and ground glass opacities on imaging.
8. Consider performing a CT scan of the head to evaluate the patient's left eye dilation and orbital or neurologic involvement.
9. Consider performing a renal ultrasound to evaluate the patient's renal function and any potential kidney damage.
10. Consider performing a liver biopsy to evaluate the patient's liver function and any potential liver damage."

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**First Name (STitle) 5725**]
s note and agree
   with his findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 5400**] remains fragile. While
   his gas exchange and CXR have seemed to improve, his cardiac status has
   shown instability as last evening he developed Afib/flutter.  This AM
   he remains in Afib but with a controlled rate due to IV dilt drip.   We
   are concerned that his bladder spasms which are painful, may have
   contributed to his arrhythmia.  Urology is following closing and are
   awaiting results of a bladder scan we
ve ordered.  Meanwhile we will
   continue his abx ([**Last Name (un) 1540**], gangcyclovir, Vori), though results of BAL were
   inconclusive.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo man with multiple myeloma s/p allogenic SCT [**2153-2-9**] with multiple
   subsequent complications including ARF, GIB, VOD, febrile neutropenia,
   CMV viremia now transferred back to the MICU in respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory Distress: Evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass
   opacities on imaging in immunocompromised pt. Acutely decompensated and
   hypertensive after bronch, which may have precipitated pulm edema and
   resp distress in setting of imparied renal function.  Also on ddx as
   per initial pulm team are non-bacterial pneumonias such as fungal
   infection, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5655**] PNA. He has responded well in the last 24 hours
   to diuresis, and is now satting well on face tent.  Bronch washing
   negative to date.   O2 requirement decreased to 3-4L NC.
   -holding off on diuresis as patient with tenuous BP in setting of
   narrow complex tachycardia.
   -[**Hospital1 **] electrolytes check
   -Aggressive pulmonary toilet
   -Vanc and azithro were stopped on [**2153-4-13**]
   -Continue atovaquone for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1694**]
   [**Name9 (PRE) 4837**] ganciclovir at current dose.
   -F/u bronch fluid cultures and blood cultures
   - Wean off O2 as tolerated
   #) Narrow complex tachycardia: Seems to have started after a severe
   bladder spasm.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be related to patient missing PL dose of
   metorpolol.  DDX for this patient is mainly between flutter or AVNRT.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be form of fib/flutter but patient mostly having discernable p
   waves.  Overnight management with metoprolol and dilt per overnight
   events above.  Patient remains of the dilt drip with a HR of < 100.
   -cont dilt gtt and wean as tolerated.  Will start PO dilt today.
   -ECG in am.
   #) Urinary retention:  Patient seems to be retaining as he has urine on
   bedside BS.  [**Month (only) 11**] be that clots are getting stuck in foley.
   - Per uro: obtain formal BS. If > 450 urine then will place larger
   foley with ability for CBI.
   #) Bladder spasms: Spasms chronic x 1 month per wife with no relief on
   oxybutynin, ?related to urinary retention.  Patient still having severe
   spasms, may have had a slight positive response to oxybutinin.
   -F/u urology recs
   -continue oxybutinin, valium and morphone IV for spasms.
   #) Left eye dilation: Likely [**1-15**] ipratropium neb although less likey
   etiologies include aneurysm or orbital process
   - F/u final MRI read and neuro/ophtho recs
   #) Hypertension / PAF/ tachycardia: currently weaning off dilt gtt.
   Will start PO dilt this am.
   #) GVHD/immunsuppression, had elevated bilirubin, thought to be due to
   GVHD. [**4-5**] RUQ u/s fairly unremarkable, no cholelithiasis or evidence
   of cholecystitis.
   -Methylprednisolone decreased [**4-11**]; continue at current dose
   -Cyclosporine decreased [**4-12**], monitor levels frequently in setting of
   rapidly changing renal function..  Dose currently at 25/25.
   #) Altered mental status
   -F/u MRI head
   #) CMV viremia: CMV titer relatively stable from [**4-3**] to [**4-9**]
   -Continue ganciclovir for now pending ID recs
   #) Multiple Myeloma: 1U platelets this morning
   -Transfuse PRBCs for Hct <28 and platelets <50K
   #) ARF: Creatinine stable at 1.9, peaked at 6.2.  Monitor closely with
   initiation of standing lasix
   -F/u renal recs
   -Will need close monitoring and adjustment of renally dosed medications
   in setting of changing renal function
   #) Hypocalcemia: Repeat PTH from [**4-8**] elevated at 532
   -Continue calcitriol
   #) Hypernatremia
   -Replete free water deficit
   #) H/o GIB
   -Monitor hct
   -Transfuse per parameters above
   -Continue IV BID PPI

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**First Name (STitle) 5725**]
s note and agree
   with his findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 5400**] remains fragile. While
   his gas exchange and CXR have seemed to improve, his cardiac status has
   shown instability as last evening he developed Afib/flutter.  This AM
   he remains in Afib but with a controlled rate due to IV dilt drip.   We
   are concerned that his bladder spasms which are painful, may have
   contributed to his arrhythmia.  Urology is following closing and are
   awaiting results of a bladder scan we
ve ordered.  Meanwhile we will
   continue his abx ([**Last Name (un) 1540**], gangcyclovir, Vori), though results of BAL were
   inconclusive.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and has developed multiple complications, including acute renal failure (ARF), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), veno-occlusive disease (VOD), febrile neutropenia, and CMV viremia.

The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for respiratory distress, which was initially thought to be due to evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass opacities on imaging. The patient has responded well to diuresis and is now saturating well on face tent. However, he continues to experience tachycardia, which is being managed with metoprolol and diltiazem.

The patient has also developed bladder spasms, which are chronic and unresponsive to oxybutynin. He has had a severe bladder spasm that led to supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and possibly flutter. The patient is currently on a diltiazem drip to manage his heart rate.

The patient has a history of GIB and is being monitored for signs of bleeding. He also has a history of GVHD and is being treated with methylprednisolone and cyclosporine.

The patient's electrolytes are abnormal, with hypocalcemia and hypernatremia. His creatinine level is stable at 1.9, and he is being monitored closely for signs of worsening renal function.

The patient's mental status is altered, and he is being evaluated for potential causes. His CMV viremia is being managed with ganciclovir.

The patient has a history of multiple myeloma and is being treated with chemotherapy. He has received 1 unit of platelets and is being transfused as needed.

The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and he is at risk for cardiac arrhythmias. He has developed Afib/flutter, which is being managed with IV diltiazem. The patient's bladder spasms may have contributed to his arrhythmia.

The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he remains at risk for respiratory failure. His oxygen requirement has decreased to 3-4 L/min.

The patient's skin is healing from superficial ulcers on his legs, and he has pitting edema extending up his legs and to his groin.

The patient's neurologic status is abnormal, with a fixed and dilated left pupil. He is moving all extremities and is oriented x3.

The patient's disposition is pending stabilization of his heart rate and weaning off the diltiazem drip.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Bladder spasms
* GIB
* GVHD
* CMV viremia
* Renal failure
* Electrolyte imbalances
* Hypocalcemia
* Hypernatremia
* Altered mental status
* Skin infections
* Neurologic complications

The patient requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical complications to prevent these potential complications from occurring."

   66 yo man with multiple myeloma s/p allogenic SCT [**2153-2-9**] with multiple
   subsequent complications including ARF, GIB, VOD, febrile neutropenia,
   CMV viremia now transferred back to the MICU in respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory Distress: Evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass
   opacities on imaging in immunocompromised pt. Acutely decompensated and
   hypertensive after bronch, which may have precipitated pulm edema and
   resp distress in setting of imparied renal function.  Also on ddx as
   per initial pulm team are non-bacterial pneumonias such as fungal
   infection, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5655**] PNA. He has responded well in the last 24 hours
   to diuresis, and is now satting well on face tent.
   -Continue aggressive diuresis with Lasix 80mg IV bid with additional
   doses prn for daily goal >500cc negative
   -[**Hospital1 **] electrolytes check
   -Aggressive pulmonary toilet
   -Continue broad spectrum antibiotics meropenem and voriconazole; ok to
   d/c azithromycin and vanco today per ID as no evidence of MRSA or
   atypicals on micro

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with multiple myeloma who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and has developed several complications, including acute respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, veno-occlusive disease, febrile neutropenia, and CMV viremia. He was transferred to the MICU for respiratory distress, with evolving pulmonary infiltrates and ground-glass opacities on imaging. The patient has responded well to diuresis and is now saturating well on a face tent. The patient has also developed urinary retention, bladder spasms, left eye dilation, hypertension, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen due to the presence of evolving pulmonary infiltrates and ground-glass opacities on imaging.
2. Urinary Retention: The patient's urinary retention may lead to further complications, such as urinary tract infections or kidney damage.
3. Bladder Spasms: The patient's bladder spasms may worsen if not adequately managed, leading to further discomfort and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Left Eye Dilation: The patient's left eye dilation may be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as an aneurysm or orbital process, which requires further evaluation and management.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may lead to further complications, such as cardiovascular events or stroke, if not adequately managed.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as infection, bleeding, or electrolyte imbalance, which requires further evaluation and management.
7. CMV Viremia: The patient's CMV viremia may lead to further complications, such as CMV retinitis or colitis, if not adequately managed.
8. Multiple Myeloma: The patient's multiple myeloma may progress and lead to further complications, such as bone marrow failure or secondary cancers, if not adequately managed.
9. ARF: The patient's acute renal failure may lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalance, acidosis, or anemia, if not adequately managed.
10. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia may lead to further complications, such as muscle cramps, cardiac arrhythmias, or seizures, if not adequately managed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue aggressive diuresis with Lasix 80mg IV bid to manage the patient's respiratory distress.
2. Monitor the patient's electrolytes and adjust diuresis accordingly to prevent electrolyte imbalance.
3. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics, including meropenem and voriconazole, to manage the patient's respiratory infection.
4. Continue anticholinergics to manage the patient's bladder spasms.
5. Monitor the patient's left eye dilation and consult with ophthalmology for further evaluation and management.
6. Continue ganciclovir for CMV viremia and monitor the patient's CMV titers.
7. Monitor the patient's multiple myeloma and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent progression.
8. Monitor the patient's ARF and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent further complications.
9. Monitor the patient's hypocalcemia and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent further complications.
10. Monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo man with multiple myeloma s/p allogenic SCT [**2153-2-9**] with multiple
   subsequent complications including ARF, GIB, VOD, febrile neutropenia,
   CMV viremia now transferred back to the MICU in respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory Distress: Evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass
   opacities on imaging in immunocompromised pt. Acutely decompensated and
   hypertensive after bronch, which may have precipitated pulm edema and
   resp distress in setting of imparied renal function with question of
   fungal infection. Was diuresed initially with good response and
   stabilization of O2 requirement at 3-4L NC.
   -Holding off on diuresis for now as patient had had tenuous BP in
   setting of narrow complex tachycardia.
   -Aggressive pulmonary toilet
   -Continue 21-day course meropenem (last day [**4-17**])
   -Continue antifungal coverage (vori -> mica [**1-15**] hypokalemia) pending
   BAL
   -Completed 16-day vanc and 5-day azithro on [**2153-4-13**]
   -F/u bronch fluid cultures and blood cultures
   - Wean off O2 as tolerated
   #) ARF: Peak Cr of 6.2 thought to be [**1-15**] cyclosporine induced ATN with
   possible component from VOD. Now s/p discontinuation of hemodialysis
   and tx of VOD. Likely with renal dysfunction still but Cr slowly
   improving Cr, decreased to 1.7 today. Concern regarding persistently
   elevated BUN, which may be [**1-15**] steroid effect, TPN, ?GI bleed (although
   Hct relatively stable) per Renal but not thought to be reflective of
   uremia given overall downward Cr trend. Chronic hemolysis possible
   given evidence of [**Last Name (un) 508**] in past but again, Cr improvement speaks against
   HUS-TTP.
   - Appreciate renal recs: No indication for hemodialysis at this point
   - Appreciate Heme-Onc input
   - Check 24-hour urine creatinine
   - Guaiac stools to r/o GIB
   - DAT, LFTs, hapto, smear, free hemoglobin to r/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 508**]
   - Renally dose meds (including cyclosporin) and closely monitor
   - Has already completed tx for VOD
   #) Hyperkalemia: Requiring kayexalate. Ddx: supratherapeutic
   cyclosporine in setting of voriconazole v. renal dysfunction v.
   potassium in TPN
   - D/c potassium in TPN
   - Change voriconazole to micafungin
   - W/u of renal failure as above
   - Monitor lytes
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Thought to be [**1-15**] multiple myeloma as has been
   chronic issue. ?TTP-HUS as above given past [**Last Name (un) 508**]
   - Check smear and labs listed above
   #) Bladder spasms: Chronic x 1 month, may have improved on oxybutynin.
   ?[**1-15**] hemorrhagic cystitis
 etiology still unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] prelim read of
   abd US, may not actually have urinary retention; may actually have been
   scanning ascites as bladder appears decompressed.
   - Cont oxybutynin; avoid morphine and valium [**1-15**] sedative effects
   - F/u abd US final read
   - F/u urology recs regarding whether further work-up w/ cystoscopy
   indicated, whether able to d/c Foley
   #) Narrow complex tachycardia: Seems to have started after a severe
   bladder spasm.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be related to patient missing PL dose of
   metorpolol.  DDX for this patient is mainly between flutter or AVNRT.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be form of fib/flutter but patient mostly having discernable p
   waves.  Initial management with metoprolol and dilt gtt, now weaned to
   dilt po without recurrence
   -Cont beta blocker and dilt
   #) Hypertension: Beta blocker and dilt.
   #) Left eye dilation: Likely [**1-15**] ipratropium neb, appears to have
   resolved. MRI head limited but no acute changes noted.
   - F/u final MRI read and any neuro/ophtho recs
   #) GVHD/immunsuppression, had elevated bilirubin, thought to be due to
   GVHD. [**4-5**] RUQ u/s fairly unremarkable, no cholelithiasis or evidence
   of cholecystitis.
   -Methylprednisolone decreased [**4-11**]; continue at current dose
   -Cyclosporine decreased [**4-12**], monitor levels frequently in setting of
   rapidly changing renal function..  Dose currently at 25/25.
   #) Altered mental status: Lethargy may be [**1-15**] valium and morphine for
   bladder spasms. No acute change on MRI head.
   -Hold further valium and morphine
   #) CMV viremia: CMV titer relatively stable from [**4-3**] to [**4-9**]
   -Continue ganciclovir for now pending ID recs
   #) Multiple Myeloma: 1U platelets this morning
   -Transfuse PRBCs for Hct <28 and platelets <50K
   #) Hypocalcemia: Repeat PTH from [**4-8**] elevated at 532
   -Continue calcitriol
   #) Hypernatremia: resolved
   #) H/o GIB
   -Guaiac stools as above; monitor hct
   -Transfuse per parameters above
   -Continue IV BID PPI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with multiple myeloma who has undergone allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and has developed various complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass opacities on imaging, which may be related to fungal infection. He is being treated with meropenem and antifungal coverage.
* Renal: The patient has AKI with a peak creatinine of 6.2, which is thought to be due to cyclosporine-induced acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with possible component from veno-occlusive disease (VOD). His creatinine has decreased to 1.7, and he is no longer receiving hemodialysis.
* Electrolytes: The patient has hyperkalemia, which is being treated with kayexalate. The differential diagnosis includes supratherapeutic cyclosporine, voriconazole, and renal dysfunction.
* Hematology: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is thought to be due to multiple myeloma. The possibility of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)-hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is being considered.
* Neurology: The patient has altered mental status, which may be related to valium and morphine for bladder spasms. He is being monitored for any changes in his mental status.
* Bladder: The patient has bladder spasms, which may be related to hemorrhagic cystitis. He is being treated with oxybutynin and is undergoing further evaluation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass opacities may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
* Renal failure: The patient's AKI may progress, leading to end-stage renal disease.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hyperkalemia may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias.
* Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia may lead to bleeding complications.
* Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state makes him susceptible to infections, including fungal and bacterial infections.
* Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may worsen, leading to neurological complications such as seizures or coma.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing meropenem and antifungal coverage for respiratory distress
* Monitoring renal function and electrolyte levels
* Transfusing platelets and red blood cells as necessary
* Continuing oxybutynin for bladder spasms
* Monitoring for signs of infection
* Continuing antiviral therapy for CMV viremia
* Continuing immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD
* Monitoring for signs of neurological complications"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo man with multiple myeloma s/p allogenic SCT [**2153-2-9**] with multiple
   subsequent complications including ARF, GIB, VOD, febrile neutropenia,
   CMV viremia now transferred back to the MICU in respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory Distress: Evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass
   opacities on imaging in immunocompromised pt. Acutely decompensated and
   hypertensive after bronch, which may have precipitated pulm edema and
   resp distress in setting of imparied renal function.  Also on ddx as
   per initial pulm team are non-bacterial pneumonias such as fungal
   infection, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5655**] PNA. He has responded well in the last 24 hours
   to diuresis, and is now satting well on face tent.  Bronch washing
   negative to date.   O2 requirement decreased to 3-4L NC.
   -holding off on diuresis as patient with tenuous BP in setting of
   narrow complex tachycardia.

   - Wean off O2 as tolerated
   #) Narrow complex tachycardia: Seems to have started after a severe
   bladder spasm.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be related to patient missing PL dose of
   metorpolol.  DDX for this patient is mainly between flutter or AVNRT.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be form of fib/flutter but patient mostly having discernable p
   waves.  Overnight management with metoprolol and dilt per overnight
   events above.  Patient remains of the dilt drip with a HR of < 100.
   -cont dilt gtt and wean as tolerated.  Will start PO dilt today.
   -ECG in am.
   #) Urinary retention:  Patient seems to be retaining as he has urine on
   bedside BS.  [**Month (only) 11**] be that clots are getting stuck in foley.
   - Per uro: obtain formal BS. If > 450 urine then will place larger
   foley with ability for CBI.
   #) Bladder spasms: Spasms chronic x 1 month per wife with no relief on
   oxybutynin, ?related to urinary retention.  Patient still having severe
   spasms, may have had a slight positive response to oxybutinin.
   -F/u urology recs
   -continue oxybutinin, valium and morphone IV for spasms.
   #) Left eye dilation: Likely [**1-15**] ipratropium neb although less likey
   etiologies include aneurysm or orbital process
   - F/u final MRI read and neuro/ophtho recs
   #) Hypertension / PAF/ tachycardia: currently weaning off dilt gtt.
   Will start PO dilt this am.
   #) GVHD/immunsuppression, had elevated bilirubin, thought to be due to
   GVHD. [**4-5**] RUQ u/s fairly unremarkable, no cholelithiasis or evidence
   of cholecystitis.
   -Methylprednisolone decreased [**4-11**]; continue at current dose
   -Cyclosporine decreased [**4-12**], monitor levels frequently in setting of
   rapidly changing renal function..  Dose currently at 25/25.
   #) Altered mental status
   -F/u MRI head
   #) CMV viremia: CMV titer relatively stable from [**4-3**] to [**4-9**]
   -Continue ganciclovir for now pending ID recs
   #) Multiple Myeloma: 1U platelets this morning
   -Transfuse PRBCs for Hct <28 and platelets <50K
   #) ARF: Creatinine stable at 1.9, peaked at 6.2.  Monitor closely with
   initiation of standing lasix
   -F/u renal recs
   -Will need close monitoring and adjustment of renally dosed medications
   in setting of changing renal function
   #) Hypocalcemia: Repeat PTH from [**4-8**] elevated at 532
   -Continue calcitriol
   #) Hypernatremia
   -Replete free water deficit
   #) H/o GIB
   -Monitor hct
   -Transfuse per parameters above
   -Continue IV BID PPI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with multiple myeloma who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and has developed multiple complications, including acute respiratory failure (ARF), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), veno-occlusive disease (VOD), febrile neutropenia, and CMV viremia.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory distress, which is attributed to evolving pulmonary infiltrates and ground glass opacities on imaging, possibly related to non-bacterial pneumonia, fungal infection, or PCP. He has responded well to diuresis and is now tolerating oxygen therapy at 3-4L via nasal cannula.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is still tenuous, and he requires close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration.
2. Narrow Complex Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be related to a severe bladder spasm or missed dose of metoprolol. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the underlying cause.
3. Urinary Retention: The patient is retaining urine, which may be related to clots getting stuck in the Foley catheter. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the underlying cause and to prevent further complications.
4. Bladder Spasms: The patient is experiencing chronic bladder spasms, which may be related to urinary retention. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the underlying cause and to prevent further complications.
5. Left Eye Dilation: The patient's left eye dilation may be related to ipratropium neb, aneurysm, or orbital process. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the underlying cause.
6. Hypertension/PAF/Tachycardia: The patient's hypertension, PAF, and tachycardia may be related to the underlying medical conditions. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the underlying cause and to prevent further complications.
7. GVHD/Immunosuppression: The patient has elevated bilirubin levels, which may be related to GVHD. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the underlying cause and to prevent further complications.
8. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be related to the underlying medical conditions. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the underlying cause.
9. CMV Viremia: The patient's CMV viremia may be related to the underlying medical conditions. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the underlying cause and to prevent further complications.
10. Multiple Myeloma: The patient's multiple myeloma may be related to the underlying medical conditions. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the underlying cause and to prevent further complications.

The patient's laboratory results are within normal limits, with the exception of elevated creatinine and bilirubin levels. His electrolyte levels are also within normal limits, with the exception of hypocalcemia.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued respiratory support with oxygen therapy and diuresis.
2. Further evaluation and management of the patient's tachycardia, urinary retention, and bladder spasms.
3. Further evaluation and management of the patient's left eye dilation and hypertensive crisis.
4. Continued immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD.
5. Continued antiviral therapy for CMV viremia.
6. Continued management of the patient's multiple myeloma.
7. Close monitoring and adjustment of renally dosed medications in setting of changing renal function.
8. Close monitoring and management of the patient's altered mental status.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   66 yo man with multiple myeloma s/p allogenic SCT [**2153-2-9**] with multiple
   subsequent complications including ARF, GIB, VOD, febrile neutropenia,
   CMV viremia now transferred back to the MICU in respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory Distress: Evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass
   opacities on imaging in immunocompromised pt. Acutely decompensated and
   hypertensive after bronch, which may have precipitated pulm edema and
   resp distress in setting of imparied renal function with question of
   fungal infection. Was diuresed initially with good response and
   stabilization of O2 requirement at 3-4L NC.
   -Holding off on diuresis for now as patient had had tenuous BP in
   setting of narrow complex tachycardia.
   -Aggressive pulmonary toilet
   -Continue 21-day course meropenem (last day [**4-17**])
   -Continue antifungal coverage (vori -> mica [**1-15**] hypokalemia) pending

   -Completed 16-day vanc and 5-day azithro on [**2153-4-13**]
   -F/u bronch fluid cultures and blood cultures
   - Wean off O2 as tolerated
   #) ARF: Peak Cr of 6.2 thought to be [**1-15**] cyclosporine induced ATN with
   possible component from VOD. Now s/p discontinuation of hemodialysis
   and tx of VOD. Likely with renal dysfunction still but Cr slowly
   improving Cr, decreased to 1.7 today. Concern regarding persistently
   elevated BUN, which may be [**1-15**] steroid effect, TPN, ?GI bleed (although
   Hct relatively stable) per Renal but not thought to be reflective of
   uremia given overall downward Cr trend. Chronic hemolysis possible
   given evidence of [**Last Name (un) 508**] in past but again, Cr improvement speaks against
   HUS-TTP.
   - Appreciate renal recs: No indication for hemodialysis at this point
   - Appreciate Heme-Onc input
   - Check 24-hour urine creatinine
   - Guaiac stools to r/o GIB
   - DAT, LFTs, hapto, smear, free hemoglobin to r/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 508**]
   - Renally dose meds (including cyclosporin) and closely monitor
   - Has already completed tx for VOD

   - Cont oxybutynin; avoid morphine and valium [**1-15**] sedative effects
   - F/u abd US final read
   - F/u urology recs regarding whether further work-up w/ cystoscopy
   indicated, whether able to d/c Foley
   #) Narrow complex tachycardia: Seems to have started after a severe
   bladder spasm.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be related to patient missing PL dose of
   metorpolol.  DDX for this patient is mainly between flutter or AVNRT.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be form of fib/flutter but patient mostly having discernable p
   waves.  Initial management with metoprolol and dilt gtt, now weaned to
   dilt po without recurrence
   -Cont beta blocker and dilt
   #) Hypertension: Beta blocker and dilt.
   #) Left eye dilation: Likely [**1-15**] ipratropium neb, appears to have
   resolved. MRI head limited but no acute changes noted.
   - F/u final MRI read and any neuro/ophtho recs
   #) GVHD/immunsuppression, had elevated bilirubin, thought to be due to
   GVHD. [**4-5**] RUQ u/s fairly unremarkable, no cholelithiasis or evidence
   of cholecystitis.
   -Methylprednisolone decreased [**4-11**]; continue at current dose
   -Cyclosporine decreased [**4-12**], monitor levels frequently in setting of
   rapidly changing renal function..  Dose currently at 25/25.
   #) Altered mental status: Lethargy may be [**1-15**] valium and morphine for
   bladder spasms. No acute change on MRI head.
   -Hold further valium and morphine
   #) CMV viremia: CMV titer relatively stable from [**4-3**] to [**4-9**]
   -Continue ganciclovir for now pending ID recs
   #) Multiple Myeloma: 1U platelets this morning
   -Transfuse PRBCs for Hct <28 and platelets <50K
   #) Hypocalcemia: Repeat PTH from [**4-8**] elevated at 532
   -Continue calcitriol
   #) Hypernatremia: resolved
   #) H/o GIB
   -Guaiac stools as above; monitor hct
   -Transfuse per parameters above
   -Continue IV BID PPI

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient, spoke with his wife and [**Name2 (NI) 5764**]
   coverage, Dr [**Name (NI) 1359**], and also spoke at length with the renal consulting
   team.  I was present for the key portion of the MICU services
   provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5765**]
s note above and agree with her
   findings and plan of care.  Overall, from a resp standpoint, Mr [**Known lastname 5400**]
   has done well with resolving infiltrates and less dyspnea.  Cultures
   non revealing, but the plan is to continue [**Last Name (un) 1540**] and Vori.  While his
   presumed cyclosporin induced ATN has resolved with better U.O. and
   gradually lower creatinine, his BUN remains high, which renal feels is
   likely due to steroids and amino acids in TPN.  Elevated K has likely
   been due to less than normal renal function, K in TPN, and effect of
   cyclosporine in conjuction with vori.  Will consult with ID but will
   likely change vori to micafungin.  K has been taken out of TPN.
   Bladder spasms are considerably improved with ditropan, both pt and
   wife agree.  [**Name2 (NI) 5766**], his Afib has been rate controlled and just this AM
   he may be back in NSR.  45 min spent in the care of this critically ill
   and complex patient.

If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo man with multiple myeloma s/p allogenic SCT [**2153-2-9**] with multiple
   subsequent complications including ARF, GIB, VOD, febrile neutropenia,
   CMV viremia now transferred back to the MICU in respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory Distress: Evolving pulmonary infiltrates/ground glass
   opacities on imaging in immunocompromised pt. Acutely decompensated and
   hypertensive after bronch, which may have precipitated pulm edema and
   resp distress in setting of imparied renal function with question of
   fungal infection. Was diuresed initially with good response and
   stabilization of O2 requirement at 3-4L NC.
   -Holding off on diuresis for now as patient had had tenuous BP in
   setting of narrow complex tachycardia.
   -Aggressive pulmonary toilet
   -Continue 21-day course meropenem (last day [**4-17**])
   -Continue antifungal coverage (vori -> mica [**1-15**] hypokalemia) pending
   BAL
   -Completed 16-day vanc and 5-day azithro on [**2153-4-13**]
   -F/u bronch fluid cultures and blood cultures
   - Wean off O2 as tolerated
   #) ARF: Peak Cr of 6.2 thought to be [**1-15**] cyclosporine induced ATN with
   possible component from VOD. Now s/p discontinuation of hemodialysis
   and tx of VOD. Likely with renal dysfunction still but Cr slowly
   improving Cr, decreased to 1.7 today. Concern regarding persistently
   elevated BUN, which may be [**1-15**] steroid effect, TPN, ?GI bleed (although
   Hct relatively stable) per Renal but not thought to be reflective of
   uremia given overall downward Cr trend. Chronic hemolysis possible
   given evidence of [**Last Name (un) 508**] in past but again, Cr improvement speaks against
   HUS-TTP.
   - Appreciate renal recs: No indication for hemodialysis at this point
   - Appreciate Heme-Onc input
   - Check 24-hour urine creatinine
   - Guaiac stools to r/o GIB
   - DAT, LFTs, hapto, smear, free hemoglobin to r/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 508**]
   - Renally dose meds (including cyclosporin) and closely monitor
   - Has already completed tx for VOD
   #) Hyperkalemia: Requiring kayexalate. Ddx: supratherapeutic
   cyclosporine in setting of voriconazole v. renal dysfunction v.
   potassium in TPN
   - D/c potassium in TPN
   - Change voriconazole to micafungin
   - W/u of renal failure as above
   - Monitor lytes
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Thought to be [**1-15**] multiple myeloma as has been
   chronic issue. ?TTP-HUS as above given past [**Last Name (un) 508**]
   - Check smear and labs listed above
   #) Bladder spasms: Chronic x 1 month, may have improved on oxybutynin.
   ?[**1-15**] hemorrhagic cystitis
 etiology still unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] prelim read of
   abd US, may not actually have urinary retention; may actually have been
   scanning ascites as bladder appears decompressed.
   - Cont oxybutynin; avoid morphine and valium [**1-15**] sedative effects
   - F/u abd US final read
   - F/u urology recs regarding whether further work-up w/ cystoscopy
   indicated, whether able to d/c Foley
   #) Narrow complex tachycardia: Seems to have started after a severe
   bladder spasm.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be related to patient missing PL dose of
   metorpolol.  DDX for this patient is mainly between flutter or AVNRT.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be form of fib/flutter but patient mostly having discernable p
   waves.  Initial management with metoprolol and dilt gtt, now weaned to
   dilt po without recurrence
   -Cont beta blocker and dilt
   #) Hypertension: Beta blocker and dilt.
   #) Left eye dilation: Likely [**1-15**] ipratropium neb, appears to have
   resolved. MRI head limited but no acute changes noted.
   - F/u final MRI read and any neuro/ophtho recs
   #) GVHD/immunsuppression, had elevated bilirubin, thought to be due to
   GVHD. [**4-5**] RUQ u/s fairly unremarkable, no cholelithiasis or evidence
   of cholecystitis.
   -Methylprednisolone decreased [**4-11**]; continue at current dose
   -Cyclosporine decreased [**4-12**], monitor levels frequently in setting of
   rapidly changing renal function..  Dose currently at 25/25.
   #) Altered mental status: Lethargy may be [**1-15**] valium and morphine for
   bladder spasms. No acute change on MRI head.
   -Hold further valium and morphine
   #) CMV viremia: CMV titer relatively stable from [**4-3**] to [**4-9**]
   -Continue ganciclovir for now pending ID recs
   #) Multiple Myeloma: 1U platelets this morning
   -Transfuse PRBCs for Hct <28 and platelets <50K
   #) Hypocalcemia: Repeat PTH from [**4-8**] elevated at 532
   -Continue calcitriol
   #) Hypernatremia: resolved
   #) H/o GIB
   -Guaiac stools as above; monitor hct
   -Transfuse per parameters above
   -Continue IV BID PPI

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient, spoke with his wife and [**Name2 (NI) 5764**]
   coverage, Dr [**Name (NI) 1359**], and also spoke at length with the renal consulting
   team.  I was present for the key portion of the MICU services
   provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5765**]
s note above and agree with her
   findings and plan of care.  Overall, from a resp standpoint, Mr [**Known lastname 5400**]
   has done well with resolving infiltrates and less dyspnea.  Cultures
   non revealing, but the plan is to continue [**Last Name (un) 1540**] and Vori.  While his
   presumed cyclosporin induced ATN has resolved with better U.O. and
   gradually lower creatinine, his BUN remains high, which renal feels is
   likely due to steroids and amino acids in TPN.  Elevated K has likely
   been due to less than normal renal function, K in TPN, and effect of
   cyclosporine in conjuction with vori.  Will consult with ID but will
   likely change vori to micafungin.  K has been taken out of TPN.
   Bladder spasms are considerably improved with ditropan, both pt and
   wife agree.  [**Name2 (NI) 5766**], his Afib has been rate controlled and just this AM
   he may be back in NSR.  45 min spent in the care of this critically ill
   and complex patient.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications may arise:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's evolving pulmonary infiltrates and ground glass opacities on imaging may lead to further respiratory distress, especially given his immunocompromised state.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's peak Cr of 6.2, thought to be cyclosporine-induced ATN with possible component from VOD, may still be a concern. The persistently elevated BUN may be related to steroid effect, TPN, or GI bleed.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, requiring kayexalate treatment. The differential diagnosis includes supratherapeutic cyclosporine, voriconazole, and renal dysfunction.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be related to multiple myeloma or TTP-HUS.
5. Bladder Spasms: The patient's chronic bladder spasms may persist, and further work-up with cystoscopy may be indicated.
6. Narrow Complex Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be related to flutter or AVNRT, and further management with beta blockers and diltiazem may be necessary.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may persist, requiring continued beta blocker and diltiazem therapy.
8. CMV Viremia: The patient's CMV titer is relatively stable, and continued ganciclovir treatment may be necessary pending ID recommendations.
9. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are low, requiring continued calcitriol treatment.
10. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, but this has resolved.

The patient's ongoing medical issues require close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo male s/p BMT with prolonged post transplant course and ICU
   admission with evaluation of progressive hypoxemic compromise and
   diffuse ground glass infiltrates.  Now he has had persistence of
   paroxysms of tachycardia, hypertension and respiratory distress.  This
   may be primary resp distress manifest as increased HR and
   BP--or--alternatively a primary cardiovascular changes manifest as resp
   distress in the setting of elevation in LVEDP as pulmonary edema is
   clearly seen on the CXR this morning.  In addition--he has had
   significant recurrence of his unilateral pupil dilation noted--this
   time on the right.  This is in the setting of oxybutinin Rx and
   Atrovent given at 3am today.
   1)Respiratory Failure-He has worsening pulmonary infiltrates, LOS
   positive 2 liters and has concerning elevation in CVP today at 14 with
   inspiratory fall but that is in the setting of significant respiratory
   distress.  In addition
patient with elevation of beta-glucan and
   concern in the immunocompromised state for possible fungal infection.
   -Antibiotics expanded to include Vanco/[**Last Name (un) 1540**]/GCV and antifungal coverage
   (vori) to continue to be discussed with ID and in the setting of fever
   certainly infection requires treatment.  Fever emerged in the setting
   of Vanco/Azitrho discontinuing
   -Will move to negative fluid balance today to move to improve
   oxygenation and improved resp distress.
   -BIPAP to aid in patient tolerance
   2)Acute Renal Failure-He does have persistent elevation of BUN in the
   setting of TPN and steroid Rx which are essential.
   -U/O continued to be brisk and Lasix responsive
   -K+ out of TPN
   -Appreciate renal input
   -CSA dosing being adjusted in concert with BMT team advice.
   -No evidence of significant [**Doctor First Name 5779**] on peripheral smear
   -No evidence of bladder dysfunction based upon detailed study with only
   mild ascites seen.
   -Would really prefer to D/C oxybutinin in the setting of altered neuro
   exam
   3)Altered Mental Status-This is manifest as significant pupillary
   changes.  His EOM are in tact this morning.  This is in the absence of
   change in exam otherwise.
   -Will pursue head CT if able to maintain safe resp status
   -Will continue to atrovent and maintain adequate delivery
   4)Atrial Fibrillation
   -Dilt increased
   -This am is sinus tachycardia and will treat pain, resp distress
   adequately this morning
   5)BMT/GVHD-
   -continue CSA and Steroids
   -Will adjust per BMT input and levels

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.1 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has worsening pulmonary infiltrates, and his respiratory distress is concerning. He will be treated with antibiotics and antifungal coverage, and his fluid balance will be monitored to improve oxygenation.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has persistent elevation in BUN, and his TPN and steroid Rx are essential. His U/O will continue to be monitored, and his CSA dosing will be adjusted in concert with the BMT team.
3. Altered mental status: The patient has significant pupillary changes, and his EOM are intact. He will be monitored for changes in his neurologic exam, and a head CT will be pursued if his respiratory status allows it.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's sinus tachycardia will be treated with pain and respiratory distress management.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: Pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary edema
* Acute renal failure: Sepsis, electrolyte imbalance, and acidosis
* Altered mental status: Increased intracranial pressure, seizures, and cerebral edema
* Atrial fibrillation: Cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and stroke
* BMT/GVHD: Infection, graft rejection, and multi-organ failure

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: TPN with lipids
* Glycemic control: Monitoring and management of blood glucose levels
* Lines: Multi-lumen central venous catheter
* Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis with compression stockings and sequential compression devices, stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI, and VAP prophylaxis with elevation of the head of the bed and use of a VAP-reducing device."

   Assessment and Plan
   A 66 yo man with multiple myeloma s/p allogenic SCT [**2153-2-9**] with
   multiple subsequent complications including ARF, GIB, VOD, febrile
   neutropenia, CMV viremia now transferred to the MICU in respiratory
   distress.
   #) Respiratory Distress: Evolving pulmonary patchy infiltrates/ground
   glass opacities on imaging in immunocompromised pt. Presumed fungal
   infection causing initial respiratory distress.  Was diuresed initially
   with good response and stabilization of O2 requirement at 3-4L NC.
   -aggressive pulmonary toilet
   -continue 21-day course meropenem (last day [**4-17**])
   -continue antifungal coverage (vori -> mica [**1-15**] hypokalemia) pending
   BAL
   -continue vancomycin (re-started on [**4-16**] for persistent fevers)
   -completed 16-day vanc and 5-day azithro on [**2153-4-13**]
   -f/u bronch fluid cultures and blood cultures
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   -continue Atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**]
   #) Fever: Unclear et. Patient spiked again overnight.  Had stopped Vanc
   and Azithro a few days ago.  Also concern for drug fever but must first
   rule out infectious source.  Consider abdominal infection versus drug
   fever in ddx.
   -blood and urine cultures pending
   -tylenol for fever
   -consider abdominal CT
   -consider paracentesis
   #) ARF: Peak Cr of 6.2 thought to be [**1-15**] cyclosporine induced ATN with
   possible component from VOD. Now s/p discontinuation of hemodialysis
   and tx of VOD. Likely with renal dysfunction still but Cr slowly
   improving, decreased to 1.5 today. Concern regarding persistently
   elevated BUN, which may be [**1-15**] steroid effect, TPN, ?GI bleed (although
   Hct relatively stable) per Renal but not thought to be reflective of
   uremia given overall downward Cr trend. Chronic hemolysis possible
   given evidence of [**Last Name (un) 508**] in past but again, Cr improvement speaks against
   HUS-TTP.
   -appreciate renal recs: no indication for hemodialysis at this point
   -appreciate heme-onc input.  Will continue to watch for TTP-HUS and
   closely follow peripheral smear.  T/c coombs testing.
   -follow-up 24-hour urine creatinine
   -DAT, LFTs, hapto, smear, free hemoglobin to r/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 508**]
   -renally dose meds (including cyclosporin) and closely monitor
   -has already completed tx for VOD
   #) Hyperkalemia: Required kayexalate 30mg once. Ddx: supratherapeutic
   cyclosporine in setting of voriconazole v. renal dysfunction v.
   potassium in TPN. Potassium has come down since switching voriconazole,
   decreasing cyclosporine and decreasing potassium in tube feeds.
   -changed voriconazole to micafungin
   -monitor lytes will replete K prn
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Thought to be [**1-15**] multiple myeloma and marrow
   suppressive therapy as has been chronic issue. ?TTP-HUS as above given
   past [**Last Name (un) 508**].
   -check smear and labs listed above
   #) Bladder spasms: Chronic x 1 month, may have improved on oxybutynin.
   ?[**1-15**] hemorrhagic cystitis
 etiology still unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] prelim read of
   abd US, may not actually have urinary retention; may actually have been
   scanning ascites as bladder appears decompressed.
   -cont oxybutynin; avoid morphine and valium [**1-15**] sedative effects
   -f/u urology recs
   -remove foley catheter today
   #) Tachycardia: Initially narrow complex likely A-fib/flutter.
   Required rate control with dilt gtt.  Now on oral dilt and in sinus
   tach.  Reasons for sinus tach include pain, fever and respiratory
   distress.  Treatment for each per specific problem.  [**Name (NI) **] monitor for
   recurrence of fib/flutter.
   -cont diltiazem
   #) Hypertension: dilt., pain control.
   #) Anisocoria: Likely [**1-15**] ipratropium neb, appears to have resolved.
   MRI head limited but no acute changes noted.  Right eye dilated today,
   EOMI.
   -f/u final MRI read and any neuro/ophtho recs
   #) GVHD/immunsuppression: Had elevated bilirubin, thought to be due to
   GVHD. [**4-5**] RUQ u/s fairly unremarkable, no cholelithiasis or evidence
   of cholecystitis.
   -methylprednisolone decreased [**4-11**]; continue at current dose
   -cyclosporine decreased [**4-12**], monitor levels frequently in setting of
   rapidly changing renal function. Dose currently at 25/25.
   #) Altered mental status: Lethargy may be [**1-15**] valium and morphine for
   bladder spasms. No acute change on MRI head.
   -hold further valium and morphine
   #) CMV viremia: CMV titer relatively stable from [**4-3**] to [**4-9**]
   -continue ganciclovir for now pending ID recs
   #) Multiple Myeloma: 1Unit platelets this morning
   -transfuse PRBCs for Hct <28 and platelets <50K
   #) Hypocalcemia: Repeat PTH from [**4-8**] elevated at 532
   -continue calcitriol
   #) Hypernatremia: resolved
   #) H/o GIB
   -monitor hct
   -transfuse per parameters above
   -continue IV BID PPI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with multiple myeloma who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to respiratory distress.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory distress: The patient has evolving pulmonary patchy infiltrates/ground glass opacities on imaging, presumed to be caused by a fungal infection. He is receiving aggressive pulmonary toilet, meropenem, and antifungal coverage with micafungin.
* Fever: The patient has had recurrent fever spikes, and blood and urine cultures are pending. The etiology is unclear, and the patient may have abdominal infection or drug fever.
* Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's peak creatinine level was 6.2, which was thought to be caused by cyclosporine-induced ATN with possible component from VOD. He is no longer receiving hemodialysis and is being treated for VOD. His creatinine level has slowly improved to 1.5, but his BUN level remains elevated.
* Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level has decreased since switching from voriconazole to micafungin and decreasing cyclosporine and potassium in his tube feeds.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, thought to be due to multiple myeloma and marrow suppressive therapy.
* Bladder spasms: The patient has chronic bladder spasms, which may have improved with oxybutynin. The etiology is unclear, and the patient may have hemorrhagic cystitis.
* Tachycardia: The patient has sinus tachycardia, which may be caused by pain, fever, and respiratory distress.
* Anisocoria: The patient's right eye is dilated, likely due to ipratropium neb, which has resolved.
* GVHD/immunsuppression: The patient has elevated bilirubin levels, which may be due to GVHD.
* Altered mental status: The patient's lethargy may be due to valium and morphine for bladder spasms.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukopenia may indicate sepsis, which could lead to organ failure.
* Renal failure: The patient's ARF may progress, leading to chronic kidney disease.
* Thrombotic events: The patient's thrombocytopenia and hyperkalemia may increase the risk of thrombotic events.
* Bladder rupture: The patient's bladder spasms and possible hemorrhagic cystitis may lead to bladder rupture.
* Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and potential sepsis may lead to neurological complications such as seizures or encephalopathy.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Aggressive pulmonary toilet and antifungal coverage
* Monitoring for sepsis and adjusting treatment as needed
* Continuing renal replacement therapy as necessary
* Transfusing platelets and PRBCs as needed
* Monitoring for thrombotic events and adjusting treatment as needed
* Continuing immunosuppressive therapy and monitoring for GVHD
* Monitoring for neurological complications and adjusting treatment as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   A 66 yo man with multiple myeloma s/p allogenic SCT [**2153-2-9**] with
   multiple subsequent complications including ARF, GIB, VOD, febrile
   neutropenia, CMV viremia now transferred to the MICU in respiratory
   distress.
   #) Respiratory Distress: Evolving pulmonary patchy infiltrates/ground
   glass opacities on imaging in immunocompromised pt. Presumed fungal
   infection causing initial respiratory distress.  Was diuresed initially
   with good response and stabilization of O2 requirement at 3-4L NC.
   -aggressive pulmonary toilet
   -continue 21-day course meropenem (last day [**4-17**])
   -continue antifungal coverage (vori -> mica [**1-15**] hypokalemia) pending
   BAL
   -continue vancomycin (re-started on [**4-16**] for persistent fevers)
   -completed 16-day vanc and 5-day azithro on [**2153-4-13**]
   -f/u bronch fluid cultures and blood cultures
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   -continue Atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**]
   #) Fever: Unclear et. Patient spiked again overnight.  Had stopped Vanc
   and Azithro a few days ago.  Also concern for drug fever but must first
   rule out infectious source.  Consider abdominal infection versus drug
   fever in ddx.
   -blood and urine cultures pending
   -tylenol for fever
   -consider abdominal CT
   -consider paracentesis
   #) ARF: Peak Cr of 6.2 thought to be [**1-15**] cyclosporine induced ATN with
   possible component from VOD. Now s/p discontinuation of hemodialysis
   and tx of VOD. Likely with renal dysfunction still but Cr slowly
   improving, decreased to 1.5 today. Concern regarding persistently
   elevated BUN, which may be [**1-15**] steroid effect, TPN, ?GI bleed (although
   Hct relatively stable) per Renal but not thought to be reflective of
   uremia given overall downward Cr trend. Chronic hemolysis possible
   given evidence of [**Last Name (un) 508**] in past but again, Cr improvement speaks against
   HUS-TTP.
   -appreciate renal recs: no indication for hemodialysis at this point
   -appreciate heme-onc input.  Will continue to watch for TTP-HUS and
   closely follow peripheral smear.  T/c coombs testing.
   -follow-up 24-hour urine creatinine
   -DAT, LFTs, hapto, smear, free hemoglobin to r/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 508**]
   -renally dose meds (including cyclosporin) and closely monitor
   -has already completed tx for VOD

   cyclosporine in setting of voriconazole v. renal dysfunction v.
   potassium in TPN. Potassium has come down since switching voriconazole,
   decreasing cyclosporine and decreasing potassium in tube feeds.
   -changed voriconazole to micafungin
   -monitor lytes will replete K prn
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Thought to be [**1-15**] multiple myeloma and marrow
   suppressive therapy as has been chronic issue. ?TTP-HUS as above given
   past [**Last Name (un) 508**].
   -check smear and labs listed above
   #) Bladder spasms: Chronic x 1 month, may have improved on oxybutynin.
   ?[**1-15**] hemorrhagic cystitis
 etiology still unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] prelim read of
   abd US, may not actually have urinary retention; may actually have been
   scanning ascites as bladder appears decompressed.
   -cont oxybutynin; avoid morphine and valium [**1-15**] sedative effects
   -f/u urology recs
   #) Tachycardia: Initially narrow complex likely A-fib/flutter.
   Required rate control with dilt gtt.  Now on oral dilt and in sinus
   tach.  Reasons for sinus tach include pain, fever and respiratory
   distress.  Treatment for each per specific problem.  [**Name (NI) **] monitor for
   recurrence of fib/flutter.
   -cont diltiazem
   #) Hypertension: dilt., pain control.
   #) Anisocoria: Likely [**1-15**] ipratropium neb, appears to have resolved.
   MRI head limited but no acute changes noted.  Right eye dilated today,
   EOMI.
   -f/u final MRI read and any neuro/ophtho recs
   #) GVHD/immunsuppression: Had elevated bilirubin, thought to be due to
   GVHD. [**4-5**] RUQ u/s fairly unremarkable, no cholelithiasis or evidence
   of cholecystitis.
   -methylprednisolone decreased [**4-11**]; continue at current dose
   -cyclosporine decreased [**4-12**], monitor levels frequently in setting of
   rapidly changing renal function. Dose currently at 25/25.
   #) Altered mental status: Lethargy may be [**1-15**] valium and morphine for
   bladder spasms. No acute change on MRI head.
   -hold further valium and morphine
   #) CMV viremia: CMV titer relatively stable from [**4-3**] to [**4-9**]
   -continue ganciclovir for now pending ID recs
   #) Multiple Myeloma: 1Unit platelets this morning
   -transfuse PRBCs for Hct <28 and platelets <50K
   #) Hypocalcemia: Repeat PTH from [**4-8**] elevated at 532
   -continue calcitriol
   #) Hypernatremia: resolved

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   A 66 yo man with multiple myeloma s/p allogenic SCT [**2153-2-9**] with
   multiple subsequent complications including ARF, GIB, VOD, febrile
   neutropenia, CMV viremia now transferred to the MICU in respiratory
   distress.
   #) Respiratory Distress: Evolving pulmonary patchy infiltrates/ground
   glass opacities on imaging in immunocompromised pt. Presumed fungal
   infection causing initial respiratory distress.  Was diuresed initially
   with good response and stabilization of O2 requirement at 3-4L NC.
   -aggressive pulmonary toilet
   -continue 21-day course meropenem (last day [**4-17**])
   -continue antifungal coverage (vori -> mica [**1-15**] hypokalemia) pending
   BAL
   -continue vancomycin (re-started on [**4-16**] for persistent fevers)
   -completed 16-day vanc and 5-day azithro on [**2153-4-13**]
   -f/u bronch fluid cultures and blood cultures
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   -continue Atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**]
   #) Fever: Unclear et. Patient spiked again overnight.  Had stopped Vanc
   and Azithro a few days ago.  Also concern for drug fever but must first
   rule out infectious source.  Consider abdominal infection versus drug
   fever in ddx.
   -blood and urine cultures pending
   -tylenol for fever
   -consider abdominal CT
   -consider paracentesis
   #) ARF: Peak Cr of 6.2 thought to be [**1-15**] cyclosporine induced ATN with
   possible component from VOD. Now s/p discontinuation of hemodialysis
   and tx of VOD. Likely with renal dysfunction still but Cr slowly
   improving, decreased to 1.5 today. Concern regarding persistently
   elevated BUN, which may be [**1-15**] steroid effect, TPN, ?GI bleed (although
   Hct relatively stable) per Renal but not thought to be reflective of
   uremia given overall downward Cr trend. Chronic hemolysis possible
   given evidence of [**Last Name (un) 508**] in past but again, Cr improvement speaks against
   HUS-TTP.
   -appreciate renal recs: no indication for hemodialysis at this point
   -appreciate heme-onc input.  Will continue to watch for TTP-HUS and
   closely follow peripheral smear.  T/c coombs testing.
   -follow-up 24-hour urine creatinine
   -DAT, LFTs, hapto, smear, free hemoglobin to r/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 508**]
   -renally dose meds (including cyclosporin) and closely monitor
   -has already completed tx for VOD
   #) Hyperkalemia: Required kayexalate 30mg once. Ddx: supratherapeutic
   cyclosporine in setting of voriconazole v. renal dysfunction v.
   potassium in TPN. Potassium has come down since switching voriconazole,
   decreasing cyclosporine and decreasing potassium in tube feeds.
   -changed voriconazole to micafungin
   -monitor lytes will replete K prn
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Thought to be [**1-15**] multiple myeloma and marrow
   suppressive therapy as has been chronic issue. ?TTP-HUS as above given
   past [**Last Name (un) 508**].
   -check smear and labs listed above
   #) Bladder spasms: Chronic x 1 month, may have improved on oxybutynin.
   ?[**1-15**] hemorrhagic cystitis
 etiology still unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] prelim read of
   abd US, may not actually have urinary retention; may actually have been
   scanning ascites as bladder appears decompressed.
   -cont oxybutynin; avoid morphine and valium [**1-15**] sedative effects
   -f/u urology recs
   #) Tachycardia: Initially narrow complex likely A-fib/flutter.
   Required rate control with dilt gtt.  Now on oral dilt and in sinus
   tach.  Reasons for sinus tach include pain, fever and respiratory
   distress.  Treatment for each per specific problem.  [**Name (NI) **] monitor for
   recurrence of fib/flutter.
   -cont diltiazem
   #) Hypertension: dilt., pain control.
   #) Anisocoria: Likely [**1-15**] ipratropium neb, appears to have resolved.
   MRI head limited but no acute changes noted.  Right eye dilated today,
   EOMI.
   -f/u final MRI read and any neuro/ophtho recs
   #) GVHD/immunsuppression: Had elevated bilirubin, thought to be due to
   GVHD. [**4-5**] RUQ u/s fairly unremarkable, no cholelithiasis or evidence
   of cholecystitis.
   -methylprednisolone decreased [**4-11**]; continue at current dose
   -cyclosporine decreased [**4-12**], monitor levels frequently in setting of
   rapidly changing renal function. Dose currently at 25/25.
   #) Altered mental status: Lethargy may be [**1-15**] valium and morphine for
   bladder spasms. No acute change on MRI head.
   -hold further valium and morphine
   #) CMV viremia: CMV titer relatively stable from [**4-3**] to [**4-9**]
   -continue ganciclovir for now pending ID recs
   #) Multiple Myeloma: 1Unit platelets this morning
   -transfuse PRBCs for Hct <28 and platelets <50K
   #) Hypocalcemia: Repeat PTH from [**4-8**] elevated at 532
   -continue calcitriol
   #) Hypernatremia: resolved

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory distress. He has a complex medical history, including acute renal failure (ARF), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), veno-occlusive disease (VOD), febrile neutropenia, and CMV viremia. The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Respiratory distress with evolving pulmonary infiltrates and ground-glass opacities on imaging
* Fever, likely due to an infectious source or drug fever
* ARF, with a peak creatinine of 6.2 mg/dL, which has improved to 1.5 mg/dL
* Thrombocytopenia, likely due to multiple myeloma and marrow suppressive therapy
* Bladder spasms, possibly due to hemorrhagic cystitis
* Tachycardia, likely due to pain, fever, and respiratory distress
* Hypertension, likely due to diltiazem and pain control
* Anisocoria, likely due to ipratropium neb, which has resolved
* Altered mental status, possibly due to valium and morphine for bladder spasms
* CMV viremia, with a relatively stable CMV titer

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis may indicate a systemic inflammatory response, which could lead to sepsis.
3. Renal failure: The patient's ARF may worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
4. Thrombotic complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and possible TTP-HUS may lead to thrombotic complications, such as stroke or pulmonary embolism.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of CMV viremia make him susceptible to opportunistic infections.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GIB and ongoing bleeding risk make him susceptible to recurrent GIB.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and possible TTP-HUS may lead to neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.

Recommendations:

1. Continue aggressive pulmonary toilet and oxygen therapy to manage respiratory distress.
2. Continue antifungal coverage and consider BAL to rule out fungal infection.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medication dosages accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and transfuse as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust medication dosages accordingly.
6. Consider abdominal CT and paracentesis to rule out abdominal infection.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust medication dosages accordingly.
8. Consider consulting a nephrologist and a hematologist to optimize the patient's care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 66-year-old male, is a post-BMT (bone marrow transplant) patient who has been admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure and is currently receiving respiratory support. The patient has a fever, tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's laboratory results show a mild decrease in WBC count, and the BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) was negative for infectious organisms. The patient's renal function has improved, and the creatinine level has decreased. The patient's respiratory status has improved, with improved aeration at the bases and recovery of visualization of the lungs on CXR (chest X-ray).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status may continue to deteriorate, and he may require more aggressive respiratory support, such as mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may continue to deteriorate, and he may require dialysis.
3. Fever: The patient's fever may be a sign of a underlying infection, and he may require further evaluation and treatment.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may continue to cause tachycardia and may require treatment with antiarrhythmic medications.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count may continue to be low, and he may require platelet transfusions.
6. Multiple Myeloma: The patient's underlying cancer may continue to progress, and he may require further treatment.
7. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure may be due to a variety of causes, including pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or pulmonary embolism.

ICU Care Plan:

1. Respiratory Support: Continue to provide respiratory support with high-flow nasal cannula and consider intubation if the patient's oxygenation requirements increase.
2. Renal Support: Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and provide supportive care, including fluid management and electrolyte replacement.
3. Fever Management: Continue to evaluate the patient for underlying infections and provide treatment as necessary.
4. Atrial Fibrillation Management: Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and provide treatment as necessary, including antiarrhythmic medications.
5. Thrombocytopenia Management: Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and provide platelet transfusions as necessary.
6. Multiple Myeloma Management: Continue to monitor the patient's underlying cancer and provide treatment as necessary.
7. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS) Management: Continue to evaluate the patient for underlying causes of respiratory failure and provide supportive care, including oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation as necessary."
