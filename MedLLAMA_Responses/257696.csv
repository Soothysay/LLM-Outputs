   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo f with hx of depression and prior suicide attempts, now with AMS
   and hypotension in setting of new onset seizures likely [**1-17**] to
   medicaion overdose.
   .
   # AMS/Seizure/hypotension: These sx are all likely secondary to
   medication overdose. It is unclear what all the pt took, but there were
   many missing clonidine, citalopram, hydroxizine, and trazadone tablets.
   Plus husband thinks pt may have taken his bottle of ""pain medication.""
   So far tox urine and serum screens are negative, but these did not
   check for oxycodone derivatives or the other above medications. Tylenol
   and salisylate levels are negative. The sz could be related to
   trazadone and the hypotension could be from clonidine. If the pt did
   not OD, she may have had a sz related to having a low threshold from
   prior hx of multiple head injuries. Labs are not consistent with a
   septic explaination. Not due ot hypotension pt is at risk for anoxic
   injury, ARF, and liver damage. Also concern for serotonin syndrome due
   to possible SSRI ingestion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS), hypotension, and new onset seizures likely related to medication overdose. The patient has a history of depression and prior suicide attempts.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.2°F (38.4°C)
* Heart rate: 107 bpm
* Blood pressure: 93/67 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. She has a multi-lumen central line, an arterial line, and a pulmonary artery catheter. The patient is receiving vasopressors, including norepinephrine and propofol, to maintain her blood pressure.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.5 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 276 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 22 mg/dL
* Glucose: 129 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.7 mmol/L
* LDH: 214 IU/L

The patient's imaging studies show:

* A chest X-ray (CXR) with an endotracheal tube in satisfactory position, an NG tube, and a central line in the superior vena cava (SVC). The CXR also shows borderline cardiomegaly, left ventricular configuration, and a small left effusion.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Hypotension and vasopressor-dependent shock
* Altered mental status and risk of anoxic injury
* Risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and liver damage
* Possible serotonin syndrome due to possible SSRI ingestion
* Leukocytosis, which may be related to cardioversions and seizures
* Elevated lactate levels, which may be related to recent hypotension and seizures

The patient's plan includes:

   However,
   the side port overlies the lower esophagus. Compared with earlier the
   same
   day, a new left IJ central line is present -- the tip overlies proximal
   SVC.
   No pneumothorax is detected.
   There is borderline cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration.
   Possible
   prominence of the main pulmonary artery, though there is some overlying
   tubing. There is a small left effusion, with left lower lobe collapse
   and/or
   consolidation, unchanged. There is also atelectasis at the right base.
   Some
   pleural parenchymal scarring at the right lung apex is noted. There is
   mild
   pulmonary vascular plethora, more pronounced compared with earlier the
   same
   day, suggesting mild fluid overload. No right-sided effusion is
   identified. An
   IV-type catheter overlies the right upper chest near the apex, of
   uncertain
   etiology or significance.

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo f with hx of depression and prior suicide attempts, now with AMS
   and hypotension in setting of new onset seizures likely [**1-17**] to
   medicaion overdose.
   .
   # AMS/Seizure/Mechanical ventilation: Presumed ingestion of clonidine,
   citalopram, hydroxizine, and trazadone tablets, +/- husband
   narcotics. Mild clonus on exam concerning for possible serotonin
   syndrome, given SSRI ingestion. No severe derangements on chem10.
   - keep intubated for now, will not pursue SBT/extubation, given run of
   wide-complex tachycardia (see below) and likely inability to protect
   airway if WCT recurs
   - neuro checks Q2H
   - f/u oxycodone screen
   - ativan PRN for sz activity
   - trend lytes and LFTs
   - toxicology recs appreciated
   - holding home meds
   - sw c/s for family
   - psych c/s once extubated
   .
   # Hypotension: As above, presumed clonidine intake, now on Propofol
   gtt. BP may increase and pressor requirement may decrease as Propofol
   weaned. Gave fluid boluses overnight.
   - levophed gtt for MAP>65
   .
   # Arrhythmia: Per OSH records, pt had VT and required 4 shocks. The
   strip from the OSH did seem consistent with VT. Had burst of wide
   complex tachycardia this morning, resolved with Bicarb infusion.
   Possibly [**1-17**] delayed absorption of one or more of overdosed medications
   e.g. trazodone.
   - EKG for repeated episodes of WCT
   - Recheck routine EKG this afternoon
   - Bicarb drip @ 200 cc/hr x 24 hrs, per toxicology recs
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor lytes
   - will check frequent EKGs tonight, Q1H for 6 hours
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Cultures sent. Possibly [**1-17**]
   cardioversions/seizure, vs infection. While hypotensive, will treat
   with antibiotics for sepsis picture.  Was given vanco and zosyn in ER.
   High risk for aspiration, given altered MS.
   - Treat empirically with ceftriaxone for now
   - F/u cultures
   - avoiding levaquin so as to not lower seizure threshold
   .
   # Asthma: stable
   - will restart advair once extubated and stable

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   SVC.
   No pneumothorax is detected.
   There is borderline cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration.
   Possible
   prominence of the main pulmonary artery, though there is some overlying
   tubing. There is a small left effusion, with left lower lobe collapse

   Some
   pleural parenchymal scarring at the right lung apex is noted. There is
   mild
   pulmonary vascular plethora, more pronounced compared with earlier the

   .
   # AMS/Seizure/Mechanical ventilation: Presumed ingestion of clonidine,
   citalopram, hydroxizine, and trazadone tablets, +/- husband
   narcotics. Mild clonus on exam concerning for possible serotonin
   syndrome, given SSRI ingestion. No severe derangements on chem10.
   - keep intubated for now, will not pursue SBT/extubation, given run of
   wide-complex tachycardia (see below) and likely inability to protect
   airway if WCT recurs
   - neuro checks Q2H
   - f/u oxycodone screen
   - ativan PRN for sz activity

   # Hypotension: As above, presumed clonidine intake, now on Propofol
   gtt. BP may increase and pressor requirement may decrease as Propofol
   weaned. Gave fluid boluses overnight.
   - levophed gtt for MAP>65
   .
   # Arrhythmia: Per OSH records, pt had VT and required 4 shocks. The
   strip from the OSH did seem consistent with VT. Had burst of wide
   complex tachycardia this morning, resolved with Bicarb infusion.
   Possibly [**1-17**] delayed absorption of one or more of overdosed medications
   e.g. trazodone.
   - EKG for repeated episodes of WCT
   - Recheck routine EKG this afternoon
   - Bicarb drip @ 200 cc/hr x 24 hrs, per toxicology recs
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor lytes
   - will check frequent EKGs tonight, Q1H for 6 hours

   # Leukocytosis/fever: Cultures sent. Possibly [**1-17**]
   cardioversions/seizure, vs infection. While hypotensive, will treat
   with antibiotics for sepsis picture.  Was given vanco and zosyn in ER.
   High risk for aspiration, given altered MS.

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS), hypotension, and seizures. She was found to have ingested a combination of medications, including clonidine, citalopram, hydroxizine, and trazadone, which is likely causing her symptoms. She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to her altered mental status and inability to protect her airway. She was also given a prophylactic antibiotic and anticonvulsant medication.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.2°F (38.4°C), heart rate of 107 bpm, and blood pressure of 93/67 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a patent airway.

The patient has a history of depression and prior suicide attempts, and her current condition is likely related to her medication overdose.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis may be indicative of an underlying infection, which could progress to sepsis if not treated promptly.
2. Serotonin Syndrome: The patient's ingestion of SSRI medications may cause serotonin syndrome, which can lead to life-threatening complications if not recognized and treated promptly.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's history of wide-complex tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia may increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias, which could be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's altered mental status and inability to protect her airway may increase her risk of respiratory failure, which could require mechanical ventilation.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's seizures and altered mental status may increase her risk of neurological complications, such as brain edema, herniation, or stroke.
6. Infection: The patient's indwelling catheters and lines may increase her risk of infection, which could be life-threatening if not treated promptly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to detect any changes in her condition.
2. Administer antibiotics empirically to cover potential infections.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's airway and respiratory status closely to detect any changes in her condition.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status closely to detect any changes in her condition.
5. Consider consulting a toxicologist or a cardiologist to help manage the patient's condition.
6. Consider performing a CT scan or MRI to rule out any underlying neurological or cardiac complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to a multi-drug overdose, hypotension, and ventricular tachycardia (VT). She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, as well as vasopressor support with norepinephrine.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 101.2°F (38.4°C)
* Heart rate: 105 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 105/80 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.5 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 276 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 22 mEq/L
* Glucose: 129 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Endotracheal tube in place
* Right and left radial pulses not assessed
* Right and left distal pulses not assessed
* Extremities: No edema noted
* Skin: Warm
* Neurologic: Follows simple commands, responds to tactile stimuli, no spontaneous movement, tone not assessed

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Multi-drug overdose: Charcoal received, toxicology pending, QRS interval shortening, and serial EKGs to follow
* Hypotension: Still requiring vasopressor support, presumed due to antihypertensive medication
* Respiratory failure: Likely to be extubated in the morning once medications wear off, possible RLL infiltrate or aspiration
* VT: Tele and monitor QRS serial ECGs

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to the multi-drug overdose
* Respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the overdose and potential aspiration
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to the overdose and potential electrolyte imbalances
* Renal failure or acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the overdose and potential hypotension
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to the overdose and potential stress ulceration
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and potential hypercoagulability

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these potential complications and optimize her care."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo f with hx of depression and prior suicide attempts, now with AMS
   and hypotension in setting of new onset seizures likely [**1-17**] to
   medicaion overdose.
   .
   # AMS/Seizure/Mechanical ventilation: Presumed ingestion of clonidine,
   citalopram, hydroxizine, and trazadone tablets, +/- husband
   narcotics. Mild clonus on exam concerning for possible serotonin
   syndrome, given SSRI ingestion. No severe derangements on chem10
   although requiring aggressive lytes repletion
   - keep intubated for now, may pursue SBT/extubation although had run of
   wide-complex tachycardia (see below, risk of inability to protect
   airway)
   - neuro checks Q2H
   - f/u oxycodone/hydroxyzine screen
   - ativan PRN for sz activity
   - trend lytes and LFTs
   - toxicology recs appreciated
   - holding home meds
   - sw c/s for family
   - psych c/s once extubated with likely 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Hypotension: As above, presumed clonidine intake, now on Propofol
   gtt. BP may increase and pressor requirement may decrease as Propofol
   weaned.
   - levophed gtt for MAP>65
 will attempt to wean today
   .
   # Arrhythmia: Per OSH records, pt had VT and required 4 shocks. The
   strip from the OSH did seem consistent with VT. Had burst of wide
   complex tachycardia yesterday, resolved with Bicarb infusion. Possibly
   [**1-17**] delayed absorption of one or more of overdosed medications e.g.
   trazodone. Also had Sinus Tach w/ IVCD vs. LBBB overnight.
   - Recheck routine EKG this afternoon
   - Bicarb drip @ 125 cc/hr x 24 hrs, per toxicology recs
 will try to
   discontinue this morning
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor lytes and aggressively replete
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Sputum gram stain showed GPC and GNdiplococci.
   Had been given Vanc/Zosyn in ER without issues. Supposed PCN/Sulfa
   allergy so started on Vanc/Aztreonam/Levo. Likely aspiration during
   cardioversion/seizure/intubation.
   - Will monitor carefully for sepsis, UOP >30cc/hr, MAP>65
   - Continue Levophed for now
   - Consider switching back to Vanc/Zosyn, as levofloxacin can lower
   seizure threshold
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   .
   # Asthma: Stable
   - will restart advair once extubated and stable

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo f with hx of depression and prior suicide attempts, now with AMS
   and hypotension in setting of new onset seizures likely [**1-17**] to
   medicaion overdose.
   .
   # AMS/Seizure/Mechanical ventilation: Presumed ingestion of clonidine,
   citalopram, hydroxizine, and trazadone tablets, +/- husband
   narcotics. Mild clonus on exam concerning for possible serotonin
   syndrome, given SSRI ingestion. No severe derangements on chem10
   although requiring aggressive lytes repletion
   - keep intubated for now, may pursue SBT/extubation although had run of
   wide-complex tachycardia (see below, risk of inability to protect
   airway)
   - neuro checks Q2H
   - f/u oxycodone/hydroxyzine screen
   - ativan PRN for sz activity
   - trend lytes and LFTs
   - toxicology recs appreciated
   - holding home meds
   - sw c/s for family
   - psych c/s once extubated with likely 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Hypotension: As above, presumed clonidine intake, now on Propofol
   gtt. BP may increase and pressor requirement may decrease as Propofol
   weaned.
   - levophed gtt for MAP>65
 will attempt to wean today
   .
   # Arrhythmia: Per OSH records, pt had VT and required 4 shocks. The
   strip from the OSH did seem consistent with VT. Had burst of wide
   complex tachycardia yesterday, resolved with Bicarb infusion. Possibly
   [**1-17**] delayed absorption of one or more of overdosed medications e.g.
   trazodone. Also had Sinus Tach w/ IVCD vs. LBBB overnight.
   - Recheck routine EKG this afternoon
   - Bicarb drip @ 125 cc/hr x 24 hrs, per toxicology recs
 will try to
   discontinue this morning
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor lytes and aggressively replete
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Sputum gram stain showed GPC and GNdiplococci.
   Had been given Vanc/Zosyn in ER without issues. Supposed PCN/Sulfa
   allergy so started on Vanc/Aztreonam/Levo. Likely aspiration during
   cardioversion/seizure/intubation.
   - Will monitor carefully for sepsis, UOP >30cc/hr, MAP>65
   - Continue Levophed for now
   - Consider switching back to Vanc/Zosyn, as levofloxacin can lower
   seizure threshold
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   .
   # Asthma: Stable
   - will restart advair once extubated and stable
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, has NGT

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of depression and prior suicide attempts, who is currently in the ICU with AMS, hypotension, and new-onset seizures likely related to medication overdose.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 100.7°F, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 99/61 mmHg. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show mild leukocytosis, with a WBC count of 12.0 x 10^9/L, and mild elevation in liver enzymes, with an ALT of 52 IU/L and AST of 52 IU/L. The patient's electrolytes are slightly abnormal, with a potassium level of 3.5 mEq/L and a magnesium level of 1.5 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history is significant for depression, and she has a history of prior suicide attempts. She is currently taking a combination of medications, including clonidine, citalopram, hydroxizine, and trazadone.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued mechanical ventilation and monitoring of vital signs.
2. Aggressive repletion of electrolytes, including potassium and magnesium.
3. Monitoring of liver enzymes and liver function tests.
4. Monitoring of the patient's mental status and neurologic function.
5. Holding of home medications and follow-up with toxicology recs.
6. Consultation with a psychiatrist and social worker.
7. Monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and oxygenation.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and fever may indicate the presence of an infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, leading to respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of cardiac arrhythmias, including wide-complex tachycardia, may increase the risk of further arrhythmias.
4. Neurologic complications: The patient's seizures and AMS may lead to neurologic complications, including brain damage or death.
5. Infection: The patient's aspiration during cardioversion/seizure/intubation may lead to an infection, which could worsen her condition.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical issues, including AMS, hypotension, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias. Close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent potential complications and improve the patient's outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of poisoning/overdose. The patient's chief complaint is a wide complex tachycardia at a rate of 160 beats per minute, which was treated with a bolus of bicarbonate and subsequently improved to a rate of 100 beats per minute.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 97 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 99/61 mmHg. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T, creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), suggesting possible cardiac injury. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 12.0 x 10^9/L, and his platelet count is decreased at 205 x 10^9/L.

The patient's medical history is significant for penicillin G, sulfa, and PCN/Sulfa allergies. The patient received multiple antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and aztreonam, which may have contributed to the development of GPC/GN diplococci in the sputum.

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Continuous cardiac monitoring
* Mechanical ventilation
* Administration of antibiotics
* Monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels
* Management of glycemic control
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer
* Monitoring for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Cardiac failure
* Respiratory failure
* Sepsis
* Pneumonia
* DVT
* Stress ulcer
* VAP

Based on the patient's laboratory results and clinical presentation, it is likely that the patient is experiencing a severe reaction to the overdose, which may be causing cardiac and respiratory instability. Further management of the patient's condition will depend on the results of ongoing monitoring and the patient's response to treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo f with hx of depression and prior suicide attempts, now with AMS
   and hypotension in setting of new onset seizures likely [**1-17**] to
   medicaion overdose.
   .
   # AMS/Seizure/Mechanical ventilation: Presumed ingestion of clonidine,
   citalopram, hydroxizine, and trazadone tablets, +/- husband
   narcotics. Mild clonus on exam concerning for possible serotonin
   syndrome, given SSRI ingestion. No severe derangements on chem10
   although requiring aggressive lytes repletion
   - keep intubated for now, may pursue SBT/extubation although had run of
   wide-complex tachycardia (see below, risk of inability to protect
   airway)
   - neuro checks Q2H
   - f/u oxycodone/hydroxyzine screen
   - ativan PRN for sz activity
   - trend lytes and LFTs
   - toxicology recs appreciated
   - holding home meds
   - sw c/s for family
   - psych c/s once extubated with likely 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Hypotension: As above, presumed clonidine intake, now on Propofol
   gtt. BP may increase and pressor requirement may decrease as Propofol
   weaned.
   - levophed gtt for MAP>65
 will attempt to wean today
   .
   # Arrhythmia: Per OSH records, pt had VT and required 4 shocks. The
   strip from the OSH did seem consistent with VT. Had burst of wide
   complex tachycardia yesterday, resolved with Bicarb infusion. Possibly
   [**1-17**] delayed absorption of one or more of overdosed medications e.g.
   trazodone. Also had Sinus Tach w/ IVCD vs. LBBB overnight.
   - Recheck routine EKG this afternoon
   - Bicarb drip @ 125 cc/hr x 24 hrs, per toxicology recs
 will try to
   discontinue this morning
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor lytes and aggressively replete
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Sputum gram stain showed GPC and GNdiplococci.
   Had been given Vanc/Zosyn in ER without issues. Supposed PCN/Sulfa
   allergy so started on Vanc/Aztreonam/Levo. Likely aspiration during
   cardioversion/seizure/intubation.
   - Will monitor carefully for sepsis, UOP >30cc/hr, MAP>65
   - Continue Levophed for now
   - Consider switching back to Vanc/Zosyn, as levofloxacin can lower
   seizure threshold
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   .
   # Asthma: Stable
   - will restart advair once extubated and stable

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are noted:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS) and hypotension following a suspected medication overdose. She has a history of depression and prior suicide attempts. The patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated due to wide-complex tachycardia and possible inability to protect her airway. She has been treated with propofol, bicarbonate, and levophed infusions. The patient has also been diagnosed with leukocytosis and fever, with a sputum gram stain showing GPC and GN diplococci. She has a supposed PCN/Sulfa allergy and has been started on vancomycin, aztreonam, and levofloxacin.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Serotonin Syndrome:** The patient has ingested SSRI medications, which may lead to serotonin syndrome, a life-threatening condition characterized by autonomic instability, neuromuscular abnormalities, and changes in mental status.
2. **Delayed Absorption of Overdosed Medications:** The patient may experience delayed absorption of one or more of the overdosed medications, leading to prolonged or recurrent episodes of wide-complex tachycardia.
3. **Sepsis:** The patient has leukocytosis and fever, which may indicate the development of sepsis, a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and treatment.
4. **Arrhythmias:** The patient has a history of wide-complex tachycardia and may be at risk for recurrent arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.
5. **Hypotension:** The patient's hypotension may worsen due to the ongoing medication overdose, leading to decreased cardiac output and organ perfusion.
6. **Pulmonary Complications:** The patient's mechanical ventilation and possible aspiration during cardioversion/seizure/intubation may lead to pulmonary complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
7. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient's nausea and vomiting may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, which may worsen her overall condition.
8. **Neurological Complications:** The patient's AMS and possible seizure activity may lead to neurological complications, including intracranial hypertension and cerebral edema.
9. **Infection:** The patient's leukocytosis and fever may indicate the development of an infection, which may require prompt recognition and treatment.

**Plan:**

1. Continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
2. Recheck the patient's EKG and monitor for signs of arrhythmias.
3. Aggressively replete the patient's electrolytes and fluids.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider weaning from mechanical ventilation.
5. Continue treatment for sepsis, including antibiotics and supportive care.
6. Monitor the patient's neurological status and consider imaging studies to rule out intracranial pathology.
7. Consider switching back to vancomycin and zosyn if the patient's condition worsens or if levofloxacin is suspected to lower the seizure threshold.
8. Follow-up blood, urine, and sputum cultures to monitor for signs of infection.
9. Consider restarting Advair once the patient is extubated and stable."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS), hypotension, and seizures, likely due to an intentional ingestion of clonidine, citalopram, hydroxizine, and trazadone tablets, possibly with her husband's involvement. She is intubated and sedated. The patient has ongoing QRS widening on EKG, which is likely related to hydroxyzine. She also has leukocytosis, fever, and a positive sputum gram stain, suggesting aspiration during cardioversion/seizure/intubation. The patient has several medical complications, including hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities, and possible bezoar formation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bezoar formation: The patient's ongoing QRS widening on EKG and the presence of GPC and GNdiplococci in her sputum suggest the possibility of bezoar formation, which could lead to further complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis, fever, and positive sputum gram stain increase her risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to organ failure and mortality.
3. Electrolyte abnormalities: The patient's electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia and hypocalcemia, could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could lead to organ hypoperfusion, including cerebral, cardiac, and renal hypoperfusion, which could result in further complications, such as cerebral edema, cardiac arrest, or acute kidney injury.
5. Pulmonary complications: The patient's respiratory support and positive pressure ventilation could lead to further complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, lung injury, or respiratory failure.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's NPO status and NG tube could lead to further complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's AMS and seizures could lead to further neurological complications, such as cerebral edema, intracranial hemorrhage, or status epilepticus."

   Assessment and Plan
   54F with AMS and hypotension in setting of new onset seizures likely
   [**1-17**] to presumed ingestion of clonidine, citalopram, hydroxizine, and
   trazadone tablets, +/- husband
s narcotics.
   # AMS: Intubated and sedated for now
   - Keep intubated
   - neuro checks Q2H
   - f/u oxycodone/hydroxyzine screen
   - ativan PRN for sz activity
   .
   # Arrhythmia: Continues to have QRS widening 48 hours out, likely [**1-17**]
   Hydroxyzine. Raises question of bezoar. QRS resolves with bicarb.
   - GI c/s to evaluate for bezoar
   - Recheck routine EKG this afternoon
   - Bicarb drip @ 125 cc/hr x 24 hrs, per toxicology recs
 will try to
   discontinue this morning
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor lytes and aggressively replete
   # Suicidal Ideation: Presumed
   - sw c/s for family
   - psych c/s once extubated with likely 1:1 sitter
   # Electrolyte abnormalities: On bicarb drip.
   -          Q4 checks of electrolytes, pH, lactate and repletion prn
   # Hypotension: Presumed [**1-17**] clonidine intake, now on Propofol gtt. BP
   may increase and pressor requirement may decrease as Propofol weaned.
   - levophed gtt for MAP>65
 will attempt to wean today
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Sputum gram stain showed GPC and GNdiplococci..
   Likely aspiration during cardioversion/seizure/intubation.
   - Monitor for sepsis, UOP >30cc/hr, MAP>65
   - Continue Levophed
   - [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 339**] [**Last Name (un) **]
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   # Swollen L hand: Likely [**1-17**] IV attempts. No evidence of cellulites.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS) and hypotension, likely related to the ingestion of clonidine, citalopram, hydroxyzine, and trazodone tablets, possibly with her husband's involvement.

The patient has been intubated and sedated, and is currently on a bicarb drip to manage QRS widening. She has also been started on propofol and levophed infusions to manage her blood pressure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 100.4°F, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 99/61 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 99%, and she is receiving supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 12.0 x 10^9/L, and a lactate level of 1.3 mmol/L. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.3 mmol/L.

The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, likely due to aspiration during cardioversion, seizure, or intubation. She is being treated with antibiotics, and her sputum cultures are pending.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a swollen left hand, likely due to IV attempts. She is also experiencing suicidal ideation, and a social work consult has been ordered to evaluate her family situation.

The patient's plan includes continued intubation and sedation, with plans to wean off propofol and levophed infusions as tolerated. She will also be monitored for sepsis, and her electrolyte levels will be closely monitored and repleted as needed.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia puts her at risk for developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's bicarb drip and propofol infusion may cause electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's continued intubation and sedation may lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's QRS widening and history of ingestion of trazodone may increase her risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes.
5. Suicidal ideation: The patient's suicidal ideation and history of substance abuse may put her at risk for self-harm or suicide attempts.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these potential complications and ensure her safe recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS) and hypotension. The patient has a history of new onset seizures, likely related to the ingestion of clonidine, citalopram, hydroxyzine, and trazodone tablets. The patient is intubated and sedated.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate, and ionized calcium, which may indicate sepsis. The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) shows QRS widening, which may be related to hydroxyzine toxicity. The patient is on a bicarbonate drip to help resolve this issue.

The patient has a parapneumonic effusion, which is likely related to aspiration during cardioversion/seizure/intubation. The patient's sputum gram stain shows GPC and GNdiplococci, which may indicate aspiration.

The patient has swollen L hand, which may be related to IV attempts. The patient's asthma is stable, but they are NPO for now.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Intubation and sedation for now
* Keep intubated given wide complex tachycardia yesterday morning and increased QRS overnight
* Neuro checks every 2 hours
* F/u oxycodone/hydroxyzine screen
* Ativan PRN for sz activity
* Trend electrolytes every 6 hours and LFTs daily
* Trend ABGs every 4-6 hours
* Appreciate toxicology following: their recs today per below
* SW consult for family
* Psych consult once extubated and 1:1 sitter
* GI c/s to evaluate for bezoar

* Thoracentesis if sufficient volume to tap
* Suicidal ideation: SW c/s for family, psych c/s once extubated with likely 1:1 sitter
* Electrolyte abnormalities: Q4 checks of electrolytes, pH, lactate and repletion prn per above
* Hypotension: Presumed [**1-17**] clonidine intake, now on Propofol gtt. BP may increase and pressor requirement may decrease as Propofol weaned.
* Leukocytosis/fever: Monitor for sepsis, UOP >30cc/hr, MAP>65
* Will switch to Vanc/Meropenem given concerns for lowering seizure threshold and widening QRS (as pt already has)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # Arrhythmia: Bicarb gtt off. QRS within normal limits. No bezoar seen
   by GI on EGD
   - Recheck routine EKG this afternoon ([**Hospital1 7**])
   - Will check ABGs q8 hours with lactate and ionized calcium; goal
   pH<7.5
   - monitor on telemetry
   - monitor lytes and aggressively replete per above
   # Parapneumonic effusion: Seen on CXR, likely in setting of RML/RLL

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS), hypotension, and new onset seizures likely due to a presumed ingestion of clonidine, citalopram, hydroxyzine, and trazadone tablets. She is intubated and sedated. The patient's condition is being monitored closely, and various medications are being administered to manage her symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure activity: The patient has a history of seizures, and the ingestion of clonidine, citalopram, and trazadone may have triggered this episode. It is essential to monitor the patient's seizure activity and manage it accordingly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. However, there is a risk of respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying condition and the potential for aspiration.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has hypotension, which may be related to the ingestion of clonidine. It is crucial to monitor the patient's blood pressure and cardiovascular status closely.
4. Infection: The patient has a leukocytosis and fever, which may indicate an infection. It is essential to monitor the patient's temperature and white blood cell count and to treat any infection promptly.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows a parapneumonic effusion, which may be related to aspiration during cardioversion or intubation.
6. Sepsis: The patient's temperature and white blood cell count are elevated, which may indicate sepsis. It is crucial to monitor the patient's vital signs and to treat sepsis promptly.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is NPO, which may lead to nutritional deficiencies. It is essential to monitor the patient's nutritional status and to provide adequate nutrition.
8. Skin breakdown: The patient has a swollen left hand, which may be related to IV attempts. It is crucial to monitor the patient's skin status and to prevent skin breakdown.

Overall, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are essential to prevent these complications and to improve the patient's outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia: The patient has a parapneumonic effusion, likely due to aspiration during cardioversion/seizure/intubation. This increases the risk of developing pneumonia.
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of VAP.
	* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's condition worsens.
2. Cardiac Complications:
	* Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of cardiac arrhythmias, and the recent ingestion of clonidine, citalopram, hydroxyzine, and trazadone tablets may increase the risk of arrhythmias.
	* Cardiac failure: The patient's blood pressure is low, and the patient is on pressor support, which increases the risk of cardiac failure.
3. Neurological Complications:
	* Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures, and the recent ingestion of clonidine, citalopram, hydroxyzine, and trazadone tablets may increase the risk of seizures.
	* Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status is stable, but there is a risk of neurological deterioration if the patient's condition worsens.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Aspiration: The patient has a parapneumonic effusion, which increases the risk of aspiration.
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to the use of anticoagulants and the patient's underlying medical condition.
5. Infection Complications:
	* Sepsis: The patient has a leukocytosis and fever, which increases the risk of sepsis.
	* Infection: The patient has a history of aspiration during cardioversion/seizure/intubation, which increases the risk of infection.
6. Other Complications:
	* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which increases the risk of hypotension.
	* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which increases the risk of renal failure.
	* Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, which increases the risk of hepatic failure.

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension. The patient underwent an endoscopy procedure yesterday, which revealed no bezoar. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, and blood pressure of 104/59 mmHg. The patient is receiving propofol infusion and various medications for prophylaxis, including heparin sodium.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100% on 40% FiO2. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode and a tidal volume of 500 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The liver enzymes and kidney function tests are within normal limits. The patient's blood glucose level is controlled, and his electrolyte levels are normal.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and the patient is receiving mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's condition worsens.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of cardiovascular disease and is receiving various medications. There is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, especially with the use of propofol.
3. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is normal, but there is a risk of sepsis due to the patient's underlying medical conditions and the use of invasive lines and devices.
4. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk of developing pneumonia due to the use of mechanical ventilation and the presence of an endotracheal tube.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient underwent an endoscopy procedure, which revealed no bezoar. However, there is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's underlying medical conditions and the use of medications.
6. Renal failure: The patient's kidney function tests are within normal limits, but there is a risk of renal failure due to the patient's underlying medical conditions and the use of medications.
7. Neurological complications: The patient is sedated and has a risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, due to the use of propofol and other medications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status (AMS) and hypotension following a suspected ingestion of clonidine, citalopram, hydroxyzine, and trazadone tablets. She also presented with new onset seizures.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, receiving mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 14 and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her blood pressure is stable, but her lactate levels are elevated. She is also experiencing leukocytosis and fever, which may be related to aspiration during cardioversion/seizure/intubation.

The patient has several potential medical complications that need to be monitored and managed:

1. Cardiac dysrhythmia: The patient's QRS complex is within normal limits, but she is at risk for developing arrhythmias due to her ingestion of medications and the presence of electrolyte imbalances.
2. Poisoning/overdose: The patient's ingestion of multiple medications may lead to toxic effects, including seizures, respiratory depression, and cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Leukocytosis/fever: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever may indicate the presence of an infection, which needs to be treated promptly to prevent sepsis.
4. Parapneumonic effusion: The patient's chest X-ray shows a parapneumonic effusion, which may require thoracentesis if the fluid is significant.
5. Suicidal ideation: The patient's ingestion of medications may have been intentional, and she may be at risk for suicidal behavior.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure may be affected by her ingestion of clonidine and other medications, and she may require aggressive treatment to maintain a blood pressure of >65 mmHg.
7. Swollen left hand: The patient's swollen left hand may be related to IV attempts, and she should be monitored for signs of cellulitis.

The patient's plan includes:

1. SBT and extubation likely today
2. Neuro checks Q2H
3. F/u oxycodone/hydroxyzine screen
4. Ativan PRN for sz activity
5. Trend electrolytes every 6 hours and LFTs daily
6. Appreciate toxicology following
7. SW consult for family
8. Psych consult once extubated and 1:1 sitter

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

1. Nutrition: NPO for now, with a nasogastric tube in place
2. Glycemic control: Monitoring glucose levels and adjusting insulin therapy as needed
3. Lines: Arterial line, multi-lumen line, and peripheral IV lines
4. Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis with heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole, and VAP prophylaxis with chlorhexidine
5. Code status: Full code, confirmed
6. Disposition: ICU for now, with a plan for transfer to a step-down unit once the patient is extubated and stabilized."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   54F with AMS and hypotension in setting of new onset seizures likely
   [**1-17**] to presumed ingestion of clonidine, citalopram, hydroxizine, and
   trazadone tablets, +/- husband
s narcotics.
   # AMS: Extubated. Per psychiatry yesterday, still mildly delirious
   - neuro checks Q2H
 q4h
   - f/u oxycodone/hydroxyzine screen
   - ativan PRN for sz activity
   - trend electrolytes and ABGs [**Hospital1 7**] now (Aline removed yesterday)
   - Appreciate toxicology following: Bicarb gtt turned off yesterday
   early evening with q1hr EKG checks that were WNL
   - SW consult for family
 already saw husband; appreciate psych consult
   and 1:1 sitter
 will consider restarting Risperdal qHS
   .
   # Arrhythmia: Bicarb gtt off. QRS within normal limits. No bezoar seen
   by GI on EGD
   - Recheck routine EKGs q8h
   - Will check ABGs q8 hours with lactate and ionized calcium; goal
   pH<7.5
   - monitor on telemetry
   - monitor lytes and aggressively replete per above (electrolytes more
   stable now)
   # Parapneumonic effusion: Seen on CXR, likely in setting of RML/RLL
   aspiration
   - Will monitor by EKG
   # Suicidal Ideation: Presumed
   - Social Work c/s for family appreciated
   - Psychiatry following also appreciated; patient with 1:1 sitter now
   # Hypotension: Presumed [**1-17**] clonidine intake, now extubated and still
   with relative hypotension
   - [**Name2 (NI) 133**] continue to monitor
   - Goal UOP>30cc/hr, MAP>65
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: Sputum gram stain showed GPC and GNdiplococci..
   Likely aspiration during cardioversion/seizure/intubation. WBC
   gradually improving, no low-grade fevers X~24 hours
   - Monitor for sepsis, UOP >30cc/hr, MAP>65
   - On Vanc/Meropenem Day [**3-23**] given concerns for lowering seizure
   threshold and widening QRS (as pt already has); increased Vancomycin
   yesterday and will check trough tomorrow morning
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures
   # Swollen L hand: Likely [**1-17**] IV attempts. No evidence of cellulites.
   - monitor
   - warm packs, elevation
   .
   # Asthma: Stable
   - Off home meds
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, has NGT for suctioning only. If extubated today,
   will swallow trial at bedside and possibly advance diet or start TPN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS) and hypotension following a presumed ingestion of clonidine, citalopram, hydroxyzine, and trazadone tablets. She was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, but was extubated today. She remains mildly delirious and is being monitored for suicidal ideation. Her blood cultures are pending, and she has a parapneumonic effusion on CXR. She has a swollen left hand likely due to IV attempts, and is being monitored for sepsis, hypotension, and arrhythmia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a parapneumonic effusion and leukocytosis, which increases the risk of sepsis.
2. Arrhythmia: The patient has a history of arrhythmia, and the recent ingestion of medications may have widened her QRS interval, increasing the risk of arrhythmia.
3. Suicidal Ideation: The patient's suicidal ideation is a significant concern, and close monitoring and follow-up with psychiatry is necessary.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to the ingestion of clonidine, and close monitoring of her blood pressure and cardiac function is necessary.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's parapneumonic effusion and aspiration during cardioversion/seizure/intubation may increase the risk of respiratory complications.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and history of seizures increase the risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or seizure.
7. Infection: The patient's parapneumonic effusion and leukocytosis increase the risk of infection, and close monitoring of her blood cultures and vital signs is necessary.
8. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of arrhythmia and hypotension may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest or heart failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old individual who was admitted to the ICU for management of cardiac dysrhythmia, poisoning/overdose, and other conditions. The patient has been extubated and is now breathing spontaneously with the assistance of nasal cannula oxygen. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 95/61 mmHg, heart rate of 84 bpm, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.50, pCO2 of 42 mmHg, and pO2 of 103 mmHg. The patient's neurologic examination is normal, with the patient being attentive and following simple commands.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.50, which is within normal limits, but the patient's pCO2 is elevated at 42 mmHg, indicating potential respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of cardiac dysrhythmia and is currently receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's cardiac status should be closely monitored for any signs of cardiac complications.
3. Infection: The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the patient's sputum gram stain shows moderate commensal flora. The patient's risk of infection is high, and the patient should be closely monitored for any signs of infection.
4. Neurologic Complications: The patient's neurologic examination is normal, but the patient's delirium is still present. The patient's neurologic status should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening delirium or other neurologic complications.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's nutrition is being managed with a diet advanced to clears, and the patient's glycemic control is being monitored. The patient's risk of gastrointestinal complications is high, and the patient should be closely monitored for any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or other complications.
6. Renal Complications: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 0.5 mg/dL, indicating potential renal complications. The patient's renal status should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening renal function.
7. Hepatic Complications: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating potential hepatic complications. The patient's liver status should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening liver function.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but the patient's risk of medical complications is high. The patient should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening condition or complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU with encephalopathy, shock, seizures, and respiratory failure due to suspected polysubstance overdose. The patient's condition has improved, with all symptoms resolving. However, the patient still has some potential medical complications that need to be monitored and addressed.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently on nasal cannula oxygen therapy. VAP is a potential complication, especially given the patient's previous history of respiratory failure.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of edema in both lower extremities, which increases the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as compression stockings and subcutaneous heparin, should be continued.
3. Stress ulcer: The patient has a history of shock and encephalopathy, which increases the risk of developing stress ulcer. Proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2 blockers should be continued to prevent stress ulcer.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of fever, which could be indicative of an underlying infection. Cultures should be obtained to identify the causative agent and appropriate antibiotics should be initiated.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show an abnormal electrolyte profile, including hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels and correction of any imbalances is necessary.
6. Renal impairment: The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, which could indicate renal impairment. Close monitoring of renal function and correction of any underlying causes is necessary.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is currently receiving oral nutrition, but may require further supplementation to ensure adequate nutrition.

In conclusion, the patient has made significant progress in her recovery, but still requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."
