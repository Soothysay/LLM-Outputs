   Assessment and Plan
   69 y/o M w/ no significant PMH presenting with acute posterior flail
   mitral leaflet.
   .
   # Acute Decompensated Heart Failure secondary to Acute Mitral
   Regurgitation, posterior flail leaflet:  Unclear etiology.  Currently
   HD stable, with IABP and no vasoactive agents.  LVEDP 40mmHg at the
   time of cath.  Etiologies can include papillary muscle rupture [**1-11**]
   ischemia (but patient has clean coronaries, so not likely), Acute
   Endocarditis (most likely secondary to Staph), or chronic myxomatous
   changes.  The patient presented to the OSH with T 100.5F.  Echo at OSH
   reportedly showed no vegetations, however TEE would better assess for
   veggies given suspicion of acute MR.  Acute Staph Endocarditis can lead
   to acute MR given fast degeneration.  For now, will need to cover for
   endocarditis, gram + and gram negatives given recent GI endoscopy
   involving three polypectomies.
   - TEE in AM to evaluate
   - continue diuresis w/o lasix if possible
   - continue vanc/CTX
   - Continue Heparin gtt for IABP thromboembolism prophylaxis
   - Follow MAP > 60; if decreases will plan to start pressors and place
   CVL
   - Contact OSH for BCx
   - f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs; may need dental consult pre-op
   .

   # CORONARIES:  No flow limiting CAD on cardiac catheterization.
   Ischemia is not likely etiology of MR.

   # RHYTHM:  Sinus tachycardia, likely appropriate compensatory response
   to MR to maintain MAP.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   I have reviewed admission history and physical and cardiac
   catheterization.  Course consistent with acute mitral valve
   regurgitation with pulmonary edema and hypotension. Has had essentialy
   negative coronary angiogram and IABP placement.
   Physical Examination
   Comfortable.
   JVP not elevated.
   [**2-12**] MR murmur.
   CXR: Pulmonary edema
   Medical Decision Making
   Significantly improved hemodynamics on IABP.  Mild hypotension stable
   off pressors. Oxygenation adequateand continues to diurese.  Plan also
   reviewed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1038**] regarding timing of cardiac surgery.  Will
   plan TEE today to help exclude vegetation, although endocarditis seems
   unlikely explanation.  If remains hemodynamically and endocarditis
   unlikely will plan for mitral valve repair tomorrow. Continue IABP
   hemodynamic support.
   Critical care: 30 minutes due to unstable hemodynamics requiring IABP
   management.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with no significant prior medical history, presenting with acute posterior flail mitral leaflet. He was admitted with acute decompensated heart failure secondary to acute mitral regurgitation, with unclear etiology.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37°C (98.6°F)
* Heart rate: 92 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 94/69 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 12.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 182 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 109 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.3/85.9/1.2, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 71/<0.01/<0.01, Ca++/Mg++/PO4: 8.1/1.2/3.1 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Peripheral vascular: Not assessed
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: Responds to stimuli, movement, and tone not assessed

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continue diuresis without lasix if possible
* Continue vancomycin and ceftriaxone
* Continue heparin infusion for IABP thromboembolism prophylaxis
* Follow MAP > 60; if decreases, plan to start pressors and place CVL
* Contact OSH for blood cultures
* Follow-up with cardiologist for recommendations; may need dental consult pre-op

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Acute mitral regurgitation leading to heart failure and cardiogenic shock
* Endocarditis, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure
* Pulmonary edema, which can lead to respiratory failure
* Hypotension, which can lead to organ hypoperfusion and failure
* Thromboembolism, which can lead to stroke or pulmonary embolism
* Infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure

Based on the patient's current condition and medical plan, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings to prevent or address potential complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with no significant prior medical history who presented with acute posterior flail mitral leaflet. He is currently being treated for acute decompensated heart failure secondary to acute mitral regurgitation. The etiology of the mitral regurgitation is unclear, but potential causes include papillary muscle rupture, acute ischemia, acute endocarditis (most likely secondary to Staph), or chronic myxomatous changes.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 94/69 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. He is receiving heparin sodium infusion and has an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) in place. His laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 182 K/uL. His blood glucose level is 109 mg/dL, and his troponin-T level is <0.01 ng/mL.

The patient's fluid balance is stable, with a total fluid input of 364 mL and a total fluid output of 1,350 mL. His urine output is 1,350 mL, and his NG output is not assessed.

The patient's respiratory support includes a non-rebreather oxygen delivery device, and his ABG results show a pH of 7.21 and a partial pressure of oxygen of 104 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the lack of assessment in several areas, including peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and bowel. His laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (0.5 mg/dL) and potassium (4.1 mEq/L), which may indicate kidney dysfunction and hyperkalemia, respectively.

The patient's plan includes continuing diuresis without lasix if possible, continuing vancomycin and ceftriaxone, and continuing heparin infusion for IABP thromboembolism prophylaxis. He will also undergo a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) in the morning to evaluate for vegetations, and his code status is full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Cardiac complications: Acute mitral regurgitation can lead to cardiac failure, arrhythmias, and even sudden death.
* Infective endocarditis: The patient is at risk for developing infective endocarditis, which can lead to further cardiac complications and potentially life-threatening infections.
* Kidney dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine level and hyperkalemia may indicate kidney dysfunction, which can worsen his condition and increase his risk of complications.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support includes a non-rebreather oxygen delivery device, and his ABG results show a pH of 7.21, which may indicate respiratory acidosis. He is at risk for developing respiratory complications such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
* Neurological complications: The patient's limited physical examination and lack of assessment in several areas may indicate neurological complications such as stroke or seizures.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's lack of bowel assessment and elevated creatinine level may indicate gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

Summary:

The patient, a 69-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with acute posterior flail mitral leaflet and acute decompensated heart failure secondary to acute mitral regurgitation. He is hemodynamically stable with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and no vasoactive agents. The etiology of the mitral regurgitation is unclear, but potential causes include papillary muscle rupture, acute endocarditis (most likely secondary to Staph), or chronic myxomatous changes. The patient has a history of clean coronaries, making ischemia an unlikely cause.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 94/69 mmHg. He is receiving Heparin sodium infusion for IABP thromboembolism prophylaxis and vancomycin and ceftriaxone antibiotics to cover for endocarditis. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned to evaluate for vegetations.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with elevated troponin-T levels (<0.01 ng/mL). His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are within normal limits. His electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus rhythm.

Potential medical complications:

1. Endocarditis: The patient's recent GI endoscopy involving three polypectomies may have increased the risk of endocarditis.
2. Acute mitral regurgitation: The patient's mitral regurgitation may worsen, leading to cardiac failure and decreased cardiac output.
3. IABP-related complications: The IABP may cause bleeding or thromboembolism.
4. Vasoactive agent use: The patient's hemodynamic instability may require the use of vasoactive agents, which can have potential side effects.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may worsen, leading to seizures or coma.
6. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system may increase the risk of infection.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiac function may deteriorate, leading to cardiovascular instability."

   # Acute Decompensated Heart Failure secondary to Acute Mitral
   Regurgitation, posterior flail leaflet:  Unclear etiology.  Currently
   HD stable, with IABP and no vasoactive agents.  LVEDP 40mmHg at the
   time of cath.  Etiologies can include papillary muscle rupture [**1-11**]
   ischemia (but patient has clean coronaries, so not likely), Acute
   Endocarditis (most likely secondary to Staph), or chronic myxomatous
   changes.  The patient presented to the OSH with T 100.5F.  Echo at OSH
   reportedly showed no vegetations, however TEE would better assess for
   veggies given suspicion of acute MR.  Acute Staph Endocarditis can lead
   to acute MR given fast degeneration.  For now, will need to cover for
   endocarditis, gram + and gram negatives given recent GI endoscopy
   involving three polypectomies.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with no significant prior medical history, presenting with acute posterior flail mitral leaflet and acute decompensated heart failure secondary to acute mitral regurgitation. The etiology of the acute mitral regurgitation is unclear, but potential causes include papillary muscle rupture, ischemia, acute endocarditis (most likely secondary to Staph), or chronic myxomatous changes.

The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, with an IABP and no vasoactive agents. His labs show:

* WBC: 8.7 K/uL
* Hct: 34.0%
* Plt: 182 K/uL
* Cr: 0.5 mg/dL
* TropT: <0.01
* Glucose: 109 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.3/85.9/1.2, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 71/<0.01/<0.01, Ca++: 8.1 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.2 mg/dL, PO4: 3.1 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* TEE in the morning to evaluate for vegetations
* Continue Heparin gtt for IABP thromboembolism prophylaxis
* Appreciate CT surgery following, plan to inform if patient's status changes
* Plan for repair today or more likely Monday
* Follow MAP > 60; if decreases, plan to start pressors and place CVL
* Lasix IV boluses, follow UOP, plan for 2L diuresis tonight
* Vancomycin 1g/Ceftriaxone 2g q24hrs
* Blood cultures
* Contact OSH for BCx
* Check CXR

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Acute endocarditis leading to sepsis and organ failure
* Acute mitral regurgitation leading to cardiogenic shock and death
* Hypervolemic hyponatremia leading to seizures and brain damage
* DVT and PE leading to pulmonary embolism and death
* VAP leading to sepsis and organ failure
* Stress ulcer leading to gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation
* Cardiac arrhythmias leading to cardiac arrest and death

The patient's current condition is stable, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent and detect these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Temperature: 36.2°C (97.2°F)
* Heart rate: 92 bpm (81-100 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 93/69 mmHg (84-110/73-92 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 16 inspirations per minute (15-30 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* SpO2: 94%
* Blood glucose: 109 mg/dL

Laboratory results:

* White blood cell count: 8.7 K/uL (6.9-6.1 K/uL)
* Hematocrit: 34.0% (34.3-33.0%)
* Platelet count: 182 K/uL (179-206 K/uL)
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL (0.9-0.9 mg/dL)
* TropT: <0.01 ng/mL
* Total CO2: 23 mmHg
* Glucose: 109 mg/dL (108 mg/dL)

Physical examination findings:

* General: Oriented x3, mood and affect appropriate
* HEENT: No abnormalities
* Neck: Supple with jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 6 cm
* Cardiac: Hyperdynamic, non-displaced PMI, loud S2, and IV/VI holosystolic murmur
* Lungs: Diffuse rales in all lung fields
* Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, and non-distended
* Extremities: No edema, no femoral bruits
* Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas

Potential medical complications:

1. Mitral regurgitation: The patient's severe mitral regurgitation may lead to pulmonary edema, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
2. Infective endocarditis: The patient's history of antibiotic administration and the presence of mitral regurgitation increase the risk of infective endocarditis.
3. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which may indicate the presence of sepsis.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's diffuse rales in all lung fields may indicate respiratory failure.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hyperdynamic cardiac examination and IV/VI holosystolic murmur may indicate cardiovascular instability.
6. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased platelet count may indicate renal failure.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of antibiotic administration and the presence of diffuse rales in all lung fields may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of IABP placement and the presence of diffuse rales in all lung fields may increase the risk of pulmonary embolism.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to monitor his physiological parameters closely, manage his pain effectively, and consider the potential complications mentioned above."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-inch tall, 76.8 kg individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of mitral regurgitation. The patient has undergone several diagnostic tests, including a CT scan, TEE, and lab work.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 93/69 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 94%. The patient's respiratory support includes a non-rebreather oxygen delivery device.

The patient's physical examination is notable for hyperdynamic cardiac activity, with a non-displaced PMI and loud S2. The patient has diffuse rales in all lung fields and a soft, non-tender abdomen. The patient's extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

Lab results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating myocardial damage, and decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, indicating anemia. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal limits, and their platelet count is slightly decreased.

The patient is receiving several medications, including heparin sodium, midazolam, fentanyl, and furosemide. The patient has a central line and an IABP line in place.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's mitral regurgitation, there is a risk of cardiac decompensation, including worsening heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac tamponade.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's diffuse rales in all lung fields may indicate pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can lead to respiratory failure.
3. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's decreased platelet count and prolonged bleeding time may increase the risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
4. Infection: The patient's central line and IABP line may increase the risk of infection, including central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) or catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI).
5. Metabolic complications: The patient's anemia may lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased tolerance to stress. The patient's hyperglycemia may increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis or non-ketotic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and clinical status to prevent and manage these potential complications."
