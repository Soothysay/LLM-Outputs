   Assessment and Plan
   68F with DLBCL unresponsive to chemo now day ?16 from most recent
   [**Hospital 2033**] transferred to ICU on [**2163-9-7**] in the setting of hypotension and
   tachycardia found to have tamponade-like physiologic on bedside echo
   thought d/t extrinsic compression on LV from pleural effusion, ascites.
   # Hypotension: Most likely due to tamponade-like physiology given above
   with extrinsic compression of LV worsened by IVC compression and
   decreased venous return.  This is further suggested by her more acute
   decompensation following IV lasix this am.  Given her neutropenia and
   recent R-CHOP, must also explore other causes of hypotension including
   sepsis and adrenal insufficiency.  Urine cultures from [**8-31**] and [**9-3**]
   have been negative and blood cultures from [**9-5**] have shown no growth
   to date (no other culture data from this admission and cultures from
   last admission are all negative).  No clear localizing symptoms of
   infection and abdominal pain/distention seems most likely d/t ileus,
   abdominal lymphoma and worsening ascites as opposed to clear source of
   infection.  She's has been on empiric cipro/flagyl since [**9-3**],
   transitioned to cefepime/vanco/flagyl this am.  Not entirely clear when
   last dose of prednisone with R-CHOP delivered, but also seems less
   likely etiology given acuity of decompensation.  Was hyponatremic
   (since resolved after IVFs) with urine Na <10 suggestive of
   hypovolemia, but certainly not sole cause of her marked hypotension.
        S/p bilateral thoracentesis with approximately 1400ml fluid
   removal. Appropriate [**Last Name (un) **] response.
   - Continue on neosynephrine with goal MAPs >60
   - Consider paracentesis in am (bedside ultrasound shows dilated loops
   of bowel with smaller pockets of fluid)
   - IVF bolus for increasing pressor requirement or low UOP; acknowledge
   needs preload in the above setting, however she is 3rd spacing a
   significant amount of crystalloid delivered.
   - Follow blood and urine cultures
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics with cefepime/vanco/flagyl
   # SOB/hypoxia:  In the setting of large bilateral pleural effusions now
   s/p bilateral thoracenteses.  Maintaining O2 sats 98-100% on NRB and
   symptomatically slightly improved after [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - Attempt to wean O2 as we are able
   # DLBCL:  Unresponsive to chemo thus far.  Will defer to oncology team
   regarding this, however, will continue to address goals of care with
   patient and family.
   # Pancytopenia:  In the setting of recent rx for DLBCL.
   - continue to monitor counts

   # Left shoulder Pain: Chronic issue, documented at office vist in
   [**Month (only) 779**].  Pain has progressed and pt now reported tingling in left
   fingertips. ROM limited due to pain. Xray on previous admission w/ OA
   of left shoulder joint however pt's symptoms appear more muscular/nerve
   related. ? of lymphomatous nerve compression, cervical spine
   abnormality.
   - morphine for pain control currently
   # GERD:  Continue PPI.
   # FEN:  Nutrition status very poor with albumin of 1.8.  Holding
   enteral feeding given ileus and abdominal distention.  Addtionally has
   only double lumen PICC through which abx, pressors, and IVFs going;
   thus no access for TPN at this time anyhow.
   - nutrition c/s for TPN recs
   # Proph:  Thrombocytopenic to 20K.  Pneumoboots when plts >50K.
   # Code:  FULL, confirmed with HCP Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname 2021**].  Given her
   critical illness and malignancy unresponsive to chemo to date, will
   readdress goals of care with patient and family.  Awaiting arrival of
   children from out of town.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who was transferred to the ICU on day 16 from most recent chemotherapy. She was found to have tamponade-like physiology due to extrinsic compression of the left ventricle from a large bilateral pleural effusion and ascites. The patient is hypotensive, with a systolic blood pressure of 106 mmHg, and has a heart rate of 127 beats per minute. She is also experiencing respiratory distress, with an oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula, and has a bilateral pleural effusion that was drained via thoracentesis.

The patient has a history of pancytopenia, neutropenia, and abdominal pain, and is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. She has also been experiencing ileus and abdominal distension, which is likely due to narcotics and lymphoma-related bowel obstruction. The patient has elevated liver enzymes, including total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase, which may be related to sepsis or lymphoma.

The patient's condition is critical, and she is at risk for further decompensation. She is being treated with vasopressors, and her blood pressure is being closely monitored. The patient's oxygen saturation is being maintained at 95% on nasal cannula, and she is being closely monitored for signs of respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's tamponade-like physiology is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. The patient's hypotension and tachycardia are likely related to the compression of the left ventricle, and she may require further drainage of the pleural effusion.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress is a significant concern, and she may require mechanical ventilation if her oxygen saturation continues to deteriorate.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and neutropenia suggest that she may be at risk for sepsis, which can be life-threatening if left untreated.
4. Ileus and abdominal distension: The patient's ileus and abdominal distension are likely related to lymphoma-related bowel obstruction and may require surgical intervention.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is a potential complication of her chemotherapy and may require further treatment.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is a potential complication of her chemotherapy and may require platelet transfusions.
7. Nerve compression: The patient's left shoulder pain and tingling in her fingertips may be related to lymphomatous nerve compression, which may require further evaluation and treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   68F with DLBCL unresponsive to chemo now day ?16 from most recent
   [**Hospital 2033**] transferred to ICU on [**2163-9-7**] in the setting of hypotension and
   tachycardia found to have tamponade-like physiologic on bedside echo
   thought d/t extrinsic compression on LV from pleural effusion, ascites.
   # Hypotension: Most likely due to tamponade-like physiology given above
   with extrinsic compression of LV worsened by IVC compression and
   decreased venous return.  This is further suggested by her more acute
   decompensation following IV lasix this am.  Given her neutropenia and
   recent R-CHOP, must also explore other causes of hypotension including
   sepsis and adrenal insufficiency.  Urine cultures from [**8-31**] and [**9-3**]
   have been negative and blood cultures from [**9-5**] have shown no growth
   to date (no other culture data from this admission and cultures from
   last admission are all negative).  No clear localizing symptoms of
   infection and abdominal pain/distention seems most likely d/t ileus,
   abdominal lymphoma and worsening ascites as opposed to clear source of
   infection.  She's has been on empiric cipro/flagyl since [**9-3**],
   transitioned to cefepime/vanco/flagyl this am.  Not entirely clear when
   last dose of prednisone with R-CHOP delivered, but also seems less
   likely etiology given acuity of decompensation.  Was hyponatremic
   (since resolved after IVFs) with urine Na <10 suggestive of
   hypovolemia, but certainly not sole cause of her marked hypotension.
        S/p bilateral thoracentesis with approximately 1400ml fluid
   removal. Appropriate [**Last Name (un) **] response.
   - Continue on neosynephrine with goal MAPs >60
   - Consider paracentesis in am (bedside ultrasound shows dilated loops
   of bowel with smaller pockets of fluid)
   - IVF bolus for increasing pressor requirement or low UOP; acknowledge
   needs preload in the above setting, however she is 3rd spacing a
   significant amount of crystalloid delivered.
   - Follow blood and urine cultures
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics with cefepime/vanco/flagyl
   # SOB/hypoxia:  In the setting of large bilateral pleural effusions now
   s/p bilateral thoracenteses.  Maintaining O2 sats 98-100% on NRB and
   symptomatically slightly improved after [**Female First Name (un) **].
   - Attempt to wean O2 as we are able
   # DLBCL:  Unresponsive to chemo thus far.  Will defer to oncology team
   regarding this, however, will continue to address goals of care with
   patient and family.
   # Pancytopenia:  In the setting of recent rx for DLBCL.
   - continue to monitor counts
   - neutropenic precautions
   # Ileus/abdominal distention:  Likely ileus in the setting of
   narcotics.  No clear transition point to suggest obstruction on
   imaging.  Appreciate surgery recs.
   - NPO
   - NGT to suction currently
   - As unable to take narcan PO, speak to pharmacy regarding other
   premotility agents that are not PO; cannot take PR either given
   neutropenia
   - Serial abdominal exams
   # Elevated t. bili:  AST mildly elevated, but ALT and alk phos normal.
   RUQ U/S without clear evidence of obstruction.  Bili mainly direct. LDH
   up (in setting of her lymphoma) and haptoglobin elevated on [**9-5**] (as
   acute phase reactant) so seems unlikely due to hemolysis.  No clear
   meds that might cause cholestatic picture, however will review with
   pharmacy.  ? cholestasis in setting of sepsis.
   - Continue to trend
   # Hyponatremia:  As low as 127 this am with urine lytes c/w prerenal
   etiology (Urine Na <10).  Has since normalized after receiving several
   liters of IV NS.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Left shoulder Pain: Chronic issue, documented at office vist in
   [**Month (only) 779**].  Pain has progressed and pt now reported tingling in left
   fingertips. ROM limited due to pain. Xray on previous admission w/ OA
   of left shoulder joint however pt's symptoms appear more muscular/nerve

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   tachycardia found to have tamponade-like physiologic on bedside echo
   thought d/t extrinsic compression on LV from pleural effusion, ascites.
   # Hypotension: Most likely due to tamponade-like physiology given above
   with extrinsic compression of LV worsened by IVC compression and
   decreased venous return.  This is further suggested by her more acute
   decompensation following IV lasix this am.  Given her neutropenia and
   recent R-CHOP, must also explore other causes of hypotension including
   sepsis and adrenal insufficiency.  Urine cultures from [**8-31**] and [**9-3**]
   have been negative and blood cultures from [**9-5**] have shown no growth
   to date (no other culture data from this admission and cultures from
   last admission are all negative).  No clear localizing symptoms of
   infection and abdominal pain/distention seems most likely d/t ileus,
   abdominal lymphoma and worsening ascites as opposed to clear source of
   infection.  She's has been on empiric cipro/flagyl since [**9-3**],
   transitioned to cefepime/vanco/flagyl this am.  Not entirely clear when
   last dose of prednisone with R-CHOP delivered, but also seems less
   likely etiology given acuity of decompensation.  Was hyponatremic
   (since resolved after IVFs) with urine Na <10 suggestive of
   hypovolemia, but certainly not sole cause of her marked hypotension.

   removal. Appropriate [**Last Name (un) **] response.
   - Continue on neosynephrine with goal MAPs >60
   - Consider paracentesis in am (bedside ultrasound shows dilated loops
   of bowel with smaller pockets of fluid)
   - IVF bolus for increasing pressor requirement or low UOP; acknowledge

   # DLBCL:  Unresponsive to chemo thus far.  Will defer to oncology team
   regarding this, however, will continue to address goals of care with

   # Pancytopenia:  In the setting of recent rx for DLBCL.
   - continue to monitor counts

   RUQ U/S without clear evidence of obstruction.  Bili mainly direct. LDH
   up (in setting of her lymphoma) and haptoglobin elevated on [**9-5**] (as

Summary:

The patient, a 68-year-old female with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), has been admitted to the ICU for management of hypotension, tachycardia, and respiratory distress. She has a history of unresponsiveness to chemotherapy and has undergone bilateral thoracentesis, with approximately 1400ml of fluid removal. The patient has ongoing hypotension, requiring vasopressor support, and is experiencing respiratory distress, with oxygen saturation of 95%. She has a history of abdominal pain, distension, and ileus, which is thought to be related to lymphoma and ascites. The patient also has pancytopenia, neutropenia, and hyponatremia, which has resolved after IV fluid administration.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's neutropenia, recent chemotherapy, and abdominal distension, there is a risk of sepsis, which could worsen her hypotension and respiratory distress.
2. Tamponade-like physiology: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be related to tamponade-like physiology due to extrinsic compression of the left ventricle from pleural effusion and ascites.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be related to adrenal insufficiency, which could be exacerbated by her underlying malignancy and recent chemotherapy.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia may progress to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's tamponade-like physiology and hypotension may lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's ileus, abdominal distension, and neutropenia may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as perforation or bleeding.
7. Infection: The patient's neutropenia and pancytopenia make her susceptible to infection, which could worsen her underlying condition.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase her risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of recent surgery or invasive procedures.

Plan:

1. Continue vasopressor support to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60.
2. Consider paracentesis to remove excess fluid and alleviate tamponade-like physiology.
3. Monitor blood and urine cultures to rule out sepsis.
4. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics with cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole.
5. Attempt to wean oxygen therapy as tolerated.
6. Monitor for signs of respiratory failure and cardiac complications.
7. Continue to trend liver function tests (LFTs) and electrolytes to monitor for potential liver dysfunction or electrolyte imbalances.
8. Consider adding prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection.
9. Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal complications and bleeding.
10. Reassess goals of care with the patient and family in the setting of critical illness and unresponsive malignancy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 68-year-old female with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), was transferred to the ICU on day 16 after most recent hospitalization due to hypotension and tachycardia. She was found to have a tamponade-like physiology on bedside echo, suspected to be caused by extrinsic compression on the left ventricle (LV) from pleural effusion and ascites. The patient was made DNR/DNI and will pursue comfort measures only (CMO). Pressors, antibiotics, and other treatments were stopped, and the patient is now receiving morphine prn and will start a low-dose morphine drip.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* Heart rate: 124 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 86/79 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 29 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 0.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 15 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 21 mEq/L
* Glucose: 115 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.6 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.3 g/dL
* LDH: 312 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.6 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 29 bpm, which may indicate respiratory distress or failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been treated with antibiotics, which may have been discontinued due to the decision to pursue comfort measures only. However, the patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, which may indicate ongoing sepsis.
3. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's tamponade-like physiology may worsen if the pleural effusion and ascites are not effectively managed.
4. Pain management: The patient is receiving morphine prn and will start a low-dose morphine drip, which may not adequately manage their pain and discomfort.
5. Infection: The patient's DNR/DNI status and decision to pursue comfort measures only may increase the risk of infection, as antibiotics and other treatments may not be administered.
6. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is 1,211 mL, which may indicate ongoing fluid overload or deficit."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with complaints of fatigue and shortness of breath. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 124 beats per minute, blood pressure of 86/79 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and has a pleural effusion, atrial fibrillation, and hypotension. The patient's laboratory results indicate severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's pleural effusion and atrial fibrillation may lead to respiratory failure, requiring increased mechanical ventilation and potential intubation.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and cardiac failure.
3. Bleeding Complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding complications, including hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated lactate levels may indicate sepsis or infection, which can lead to organ failure and death.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's hypotension and anemia may increase the risk of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's anemia and hypotension may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, and obstruction.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypotension may increase the risk of cerebral edema, stroke, and neurological damage.

Based on this information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to identify potential complications and adjust treatment accordingly."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old individual with Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) who has been unresponsive to chemotherapy. The patient was transferred to the ICU on [**2163-9-7**] due to hypotension and tachycardia, and was found to have a tamponade-like physiology on bedside echo, attributed to extrinsic compression on the left ventricle from pleural effusion and ascites.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 36.8°C, Tcurrent 36.7°C, HR 124 bpm, BP 86/79 mmHg, RR 29 inspirations per minute, SpO2 94%.
* Laboratory results: WBC 0.3 K/uL, Hct 23.8%, Plt 15, Cr 0.6 mg/dL, TCO2 21 mEq/L, Glucose 115 mg/dL, and other lab results as listed.
* Physical examination: Not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.
* Respiratory support: O2 delivery device aerosol-cool, SpO2 94%.
* Infusions: Lorazepam (Ativan), Morphine Sulfate, and other ICU medications.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Pleural effusion, acute
* Atrial fibrillation (AFIB)
* Hypotension (not in shock)
* Tamponade-like physiology due to extrinsic compression on the left ventricle from pleural effusion and ascites

The patient's plan of care is focused on comfort measures only, with the following interventions:

* Morphine prn and low-dose morphine drip
* Removal of O2 sat monitoring
* Monitoring for pain and discomfort
* Discontinuation of pressors, antibiotics, and other treatments

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to pleural effusion and/or AFIB
* Cardiac tamponade or worsening of tamponade-like physiology
* Infection or sepsis due to discontinuation of antibiotics
* Pain and discomfort due to underlying medical conditions
* Potential for bleeding or bleeding complications due to discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy
* Potential for electrolyte imbalances or acid-base disturbances due to ongoing medical conditions and treatments."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old individual with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who has been unresponsive to chemotherapy. The patient was admitted to the ICU on day 16 from the most recent hospitalization at Hospital 2033. The patient presented with hypotension and tachycardia, which was found to be secondary to a tamponade-like physiology caused by an extrinsic compression on the left ventricle (LV) from a pleural effusion and ascites.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Atrial fibrillation (AF)
* Hypotension (not shock)
* Pleural effusion, acute
* Comfort care measures only (CMO) with a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status
* Pressors, antibiotics, and other treatments have been stopped
* Morphine is being administered as needed for pain management

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* Heart rate: 124 bpm (115-171 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 86/79 mmHg (83 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 29 breaths per minute (14-35 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* SpO2: 94%

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 0.3
* Hematocrit: 23.8%
* Platelet count: 15
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Total bilirubin: 21%
* Glucose: 115 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.6 mmol/L

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Atrial fibrillation with an irregular pulse
* No peripheral pulses were assessed
* Skin examination was not performed
* Neurological examination was not performed

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

* Cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias due to the tamponade-like physiology
* Respiratory complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure due to the patient's pleural effusion and respiratory support
* Gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding or perforation due to the patient's ascites and abdominal pain
* Infection complications such as sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's immunosuppressed state and the presence of a central line
* Hemorrhagic complications such as bleeding due to the patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjust their care plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."
