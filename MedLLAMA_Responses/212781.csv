   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 78 F with htn, HL, pafib admitted from OSH for new
   cardiomyopathy, question of PNA, and diarrhea, now with submassive
   pulmonary embolism.
   # Pulmonary embolism - Unclear etiology, no LE DVT on Doppler. Hx of
   prior PE. Pt was at least temporarily subtheraputic on coumadin at OSH.
   Consider lysis should he develop end organ damage/hemodynamic
   instability.
   - Heparin gtt sliding scale, holding coumadin for possible cardiac cath
   - IV fluid boluses 250cc as needed for blood pressure
   -SPEP, UPEP pending for hypercoag w/u, per report pt [**Name (NI) 3796**] on age
   appropriate cancer screening.
   -No evidence LE clot, no IVC filter for now.
   #. Pump. New cardiomypathy.  Pt with EF of 30-50% in [**2167-12-26**], but repeat
   ECHO in [**1-14**] showed EF 20-30%. Patient diuresed from 204 to 193.6lbs at
   [**Location (un) **] with improvement in her dyspnea.  Fixed defects on
   echocardiogram suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities
   include: infectious state given patient's recent pneumonia and chronic
   illness.  Less likely non-ischemic etilogies include rheumatologic,
   myeloma, Hepatitis, HIV and as a consequence of RV failure . Normal
   iron, only slightly increased TSH.  Need 9 months optimal medical
   therapy before possible consideration of ICD placement.
   - will discuss possibility of cardiac cath for ischemic cardiomyopathy
   given positive stress test
   - SPEP, UPEP pending
   - cont ASA, holding lisinopril, metoprolol and furosemide given concern
   for hypotension
   - No diuresis today given diarrhea and risk for low preload/low CO
   state. PRN 250 NS IVFboluses
   #. Lung Infiltrates:  Appreciate pulmonary recommendations.  Patient's
   infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease (related to
   methotrexate or rheumatoid arthritis) rather than pneumonia.
   - Nevertheless, given patient's recent complicated OSH ICU course, will
   complete antibiotic regimen and reassess
   - Cont Vanco and Augmentin for 3 more days, last day [**1-26**].
   - cont nebs prn
   - repeat CXR
   #. Rhythm: Pt currently with NSR, has PAF.  Holding digoxin and
   metoprolol.
   - Continue heparin for AC.
   - restart coumadin after any procedures, may need to aim for higher
   goal INR as outpatient given development of emboli with slightly
   subtherapeutic INR.
   - BB on hold for hypotension, IVF for tachycardia prn.
   - cont to monitor on telemetry
   # Renal failure. Cr 1.4 in [**2164**]; now 1.3. Currently improved from
   prior.
   - CHF compenstated but will hold diuretics for now
   - renally dose medications
   # Diarrhea: Pt reports diarrhea x ~ 2 weeks. Continues to have diarrhea
   here 4-5 episodes a day. Pt has had negative C. difficile x 3 , but was
   still started on flagyl for a total of a 10 day course.   Flagyl
   stopped last night.  Given concern for large PE and low preload,
   potentially low CO, low threshold to consider bowel ischemia should she
   decompensate or develop bloody diarrhea
   - Imodium x 1 dose
   - stool studies, including bacterial cultures, O&P
   - replete lytes prn and hydration
   #. CAD: CE neg at OSH r/o for MI.  Focal wall-motion abnormalities
   suggest ischemic etiology.
   - Reportedly clean cath [**2164**], no plans to cath at present.
   - Cont ASA, Zocor.  Antihypertensives on hold.
   # HTN: Holding amlodipine, Imdur, lisinopril, BB given concern for
   hypotension.
   # Anemia: Pt with chronic anemia. Hct 34.8 today. Pt was given 2U at
   OSH. No evidence of active bleed. This is near his baseline.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation, admitted to the ICU with new-onset cardiomyopathy, suspected pulmonary embolism, and diarrhea. She has a submassive pulmonary embolism and is receiving heparin therapy. Her cardiac function is compromised, with an ejection fraction of 20-30%. She has fixed defects on echocardiogram suggesting ischemic cardiomyopathy. She is also experiencing chronic interstitial lung disease, anemia, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's submassive pulmonary embolism can lead to further embolization, hypoxia, and respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's compromised cardiac function can lead to heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, which may indicate worsening renal function.
4. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and bowel ischemia.
5. Bowel Ischemia: The patient's history of recent pneumonia and chronic illness may increase the risk of bowel ischemia.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed.
7. Depression: The patient's depression may worsen if not properly managed.
8. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic interstitial lung disease may lead to respiratory failure.
9. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if not properly managed.
10. Infection: The patient's recent pneumonia and chronic illness may increase the risk of infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue heparin therapy to prevent further pulmonary embolism.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust therapy accordingly.
3. Manage the patient's diarrhea with electrolyte repletion and hydration.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust therapy accordingly.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 78 F with htn, HL, pafib admitted from OSH for new
   cardiomyopathy (likely ICH), question of PNA, and diarrhea, now with
   submassive pulmonary embolism.
   # Pulmonary embolism - Unclear etiology, no LE DVT on Doppler. Hx of
   prior PE. Pt was at least temporarily subtheraputic on coumadin at OSH.
   Consider lysis should he develop end organ damage/hemodynamic
   instability.
   - Heparin gtt sliding scale, holding coumadin for possible cardiac cath
   - IV fluid boluses 250cc as needed for blood pressure
   -SPEP, UPEP pending for hypercoag w/u, per report pt [**Name (NI) 3796**] on age
   appropriate cancer screening.
   -No evidence LE clot, no IVC filter for now.
   #. Pump. New cardiomypathy.  Pt with EF of 30-50% in [**2167-12-26**], but repeat
   ECHO in [**1-14**] showed EF 20-30%. Patient diuresed from 204 to 193.6lbs at
   [**Location (un) **] with improvement in her dyspnea.  Fixed defects on
   echocardiogram suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities
   include: infectious state given patient's recent pneumonia and chronic
   illness.  Less likely non-ischemic etilogies include rheumatologic,
   myeloma, Hepatitis, HIV and as a consequence of RV failure . Normal
   iron, only slightly increased TSH.  Need 9 months optimal medical
   therapy before possible consideration of ICD placement.
   - will discuss possibility of cardiac cath for ischemic cardiomyopathy
   given positive stress test
   - SPEP, UPEP pending
   - cont ASA, holding lisinopril, metoprolol and furosemide given concern
   for hypotension
   - No diuresis today given diarrhea and risk for low preload/low CO
   state. PRN 250 NS IVFboluses
   #. Lung Infiltrates:  Appreciate pulmonary recommendations.  Patient's
   infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease (related to
   methotrexate or rheumatoid arthritis) rather than pneumonia.
   - Nevertheless, given patient's recent complicated OSH ICU course, will
   complete antibiotic regimen and reassess
   - Cont Vanco and Augmentin for 3 more days, last day [**1-26**].
   - cont nebs prn
   - repeat CXR
   #. Rhythm: Pt currently with NSR, has PAF.  Holding digoxin and
   metoprolol.
   - Continue heparin for AC.
   - restart coumadin after any procedures, may need to aim for higher
   goal INR as outpatient given development of emboli with slightly
   subtherapeutic INR.
   - BB on hold for hypotension, IVF for tachycardia prn.
   - cont to monitor on telemetry
   # Renal failure. Cr 1.4 in [**2164**]; now 1.3. Currently improved from
   prior.
   - CHF compenstated but will hold diuretics for now
   - renally dose medications
   # Diarrhea: Pt reports diarrhea x ~ 2 weeks. Continues to have diarrhea
   here 4-5 episodes a day. Pt has had negative C. difficile x 3 , but was
   still started on flagyl for a total of a 10 day course.   Flagyl
   stopped last night.  Given concern for large PE and low preload,
   potentially low CO, low threshold to consider bowel ischemia should she
   decompensate or develop bloody diarrhea
   - Imodium x 1 dose
   - stool studies, including bacterial cultures, O&P
   - replete lytes prn and hydration
   #. CAD: CE neg at OSH r/o for MI.  Focal wall-motion abnormalities
   suggest ischemic etiology.
   - Reportedly clean cath [**2164**], no plans to cath at present.
   - Cont ASA, Zocor.  Antihypertensives on hold.
   # HTN: Holding amlodipine, Imdur, lisinopril, BB given concern for
   hypotension.
   # Anemia: Pt with chronic anemia. Hct 34.8 today. Pt was given 2U at
   OSH. No evidence of active bleed. This is near his baseline.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, likely ischemic in nature, and submassive pulmonary embolism. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and pneumonia. She is currently being treated with heparin, metoprolol, and furosemide. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 91/44 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She has a temperature of 36.9°C and is not febrile.

The patient has a history of chronic anemia, and her hemoglobin level is 10.3 g/dL. She is being treated with iron supplements and is scheduled for further testing to rule out anemia of chronic disease.

The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20-30%. She has a history of hypertension and is being treated with antihypertensive medications.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 95%. She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is being treated with bronchodilators and oxygen therapy.

The patient's renal function is stable, with a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL. She has a history of chronic kidney disease and is being treated with renally adjusted medications.

The patient's gastrointestinal status is stable, with a stool output of 155 mL and a normal stool guaiac test. She has a history of diarrhea and is being treated with loperamide and flagyl.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiomyopathy and submassive pulmonary embolism increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Pulmonary complications: The patient's pulmonary embolism increases her risk of pulmonary complications, such as respiratory failure, pneumonia, and pulmonary hemorrhage.
3. Renal complications: The patient's chronic kidney disease and submassive pulmonary embolism increase her risk of renal complications, such as acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease progression.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's diarrhea and history of chronic gastrointestinal disease increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel ischemia and gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Anemia complications: The patient's chronic anemia and history of chronic kidney disease increase her risk of anemia complications, such as anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia.
6. Depression complications: The patient's history of depression and current treatment with celexa increase her risk of depression complications, such as suicidal ideation and depression exacerbation.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is essential to monitor her closely for any signs of cardiac, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, anemia, and depression complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of submassive pulmonary embolism, cardiomyopathy, and diarrhea. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 91/44 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is still experiencing diarrhea, with 4-5 episodes per day, and has been started on loperamide and flagyl. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, but the creatinine level is elevated at 1.3 mg/dL.

The patient has a history of cardiac disease, including cardiomyopathy, and has undergone cardiac catheterization with normal coronaries. The patient's echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction of 20-30%, suggesting ischemic cardiomyopathy.

The patient is receiving heparin for anticoagulation and is being monitored for bleeding. The patient is also receiving medications for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, but the differential is normal. The patient's troponin level is elevated at 0.02 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac damage.

The patient's medical complications include pulmonary embolism, cardiomyopathy, diarrhea, and potential renal failure. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen therapy and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's pulmonary embolism may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and death.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's cardiomyopathy may worsen, leading to heart failure and death.
3. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may worsen, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury and death.
5. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of bleeding, leading to hemorrhage and death.
6. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state may increase the risk of infection, leading to sepsis and death.
7. Depression: The patient's depression may worsen, leading to suicidal ideation and behavior.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications. The patient requires close monitoring and management of their respiratory, cardiac, and gastrointestinal systems. The patient's potential medical complications include pulmonary embolism, cardiomyopathy, diarrhea, renal failure, bleeding, infection, and depression."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 78 F with htn, HL, pafib admitted from OSH for new
   cardiomyopathy (likely ICH), question of PNA, and diarrhea, now with
   submassive pulmonary embolism.
   # Pulmonary embolism - Unclear etiology, no LE DVT on Doppler. Hx of
   prior PE. Pt was at least temporarily subtheraputic on coumadin at OSH
   and per family likely missed some coumadin doses . Consider lysis
   should he develop end organ damage/hemodynamic instability.
   - Heparin gtt sliding scale, consider higher INR goal, 2.5-3, will need
   lifelong coumadin, restarted last evening.
   - IV fluid boluses 250cc as needed for blood pressure
   -SPEP, UPEP pending for hypercoag w/u, per report pt [**Name (NI) 3796**] on age
   appropriate cancer screening.
   -No evidence LE clot, no IVC filter for now.
   -renal u/s negative for renal mass, thrombus.
   #. Pump. New cardiomypathy.  Pt with EF of 30-50% in [**2167-12-26**], but repeat
   ECHO in [**1-14**] showed EF 20-30%. Patient diuresed from 204 to 193.6lbs at
   [**Location (un) **] with improvement in her dyspnea.  Fixed defects on
   echocardiogram suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities
   include: infectious state given patient's recent pneumonia and chronic
   illness.  Less likely non-ischemic etilogies include rheumatologic,
   myeloma, Hepatitis, HIV and as a consequence of RV failure . Normal
   iron, only slightly increased TSH.  Need 9 months optimal medical
   therapy before possible consideration of ICD placement.
   - unlikely ischemic due to clean coronaries on cath here in [**2164**]
   - SPEP, UPEP pending
   - cont ASA, holding lisinopril, metoprolol and furosemide given concern
   for hypotension
   - No diuresis today given diarrhea and risk for low preload/low CO
   state. PRN 250 NS IVFboluses
   - CXR yesterday was unchanged.
   #. Lung Infiltrates:  Appreciate pulmonary recommendations.  Patient's
   infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease (related to
   methotrexate or rheumatoid arthritis) rather than pneumonia.
   - d/c
d abx, given no evidence for acute infection, augmentin may have
   caused worsening diarrhea.
   - cont nebs prn
   - repeat CXR as above unchanged
   - f/u pulm as outpatient
   #. Rhythm: Pt currently with NSR, has PAF.  Holding digoxin. Added back
   on low dose BB last night when she went back into AF with RVR with good
   response.
   - Continue heparin for AC.
   - Up titrate BB as tolerated
   - cont to monitor on telemetry
   # Renal failure. Cr 1.4 in [**2164**]; now at baseline. Currently improved
   from prior.
   - CHF compenstated but will hold diuretics for now
   - renally dose medications
   # Diarrhea: Pt reports diarrhea x ~ 2 weeks. Continues to have diarrhea
   here 4-5 episodes a day. Pt has had negative C. difficile x 3 , but was
   still started on flagyl for a total of a 10 day course.   Flagyl
   stopped last night.  Given concern for large PE and low preload,
   potentially low CO, low threshold to consider bowel ischemia should she
   decompensate or develop bloody diarrhea. Per pt and RN this am,
   diarrhea is better
   - Imodium x 1 dose
   - stool studies, including bacterial cultures, O&P  all negative
   -d/c augmentin as above.
   - replete lytes prn and hydration
   - Prelim stool studies have fecal leukocytes
   #. CAD: CE neg at OSH r/o for MI.  Focal wall-motion abnormalities
   suggest ischemic etiology.
   - Reportedly clean cath [**2164**], no plans to cath at present.
   - Cont ASA, Zocor.  Antihypertensives on hold.
   # HTN: Holding amlodipine, Imdur, lisinopril, given concern for
   hypotension.
   # Anemia: Pt with chronic anemia. Hct 34.8 today. Pt was given 2U at
   OSH. No evidence of active bleed. This is near his baseline.
   - will cont to trend
   # DM: will hold oral agents
   - monitor with QACHS FS and cover with ISS
   #. Depression: cont celexa, increased due to c/o depression

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Physical Examination
   Firm mass left breast that patient reports is unchanged and has been
   attributed to prior implant.
   Medical Decision Making
   1. Recurrent pulmonary embolus in setting of subtherapeutic
   anticoagulation. Continue heparin and titrate coumadin to INR [**1-26**].
    Underlying etiology not known.
   2. Abnormal CXR and CT with question interstitial lung disease.
   Pulmonary following.
   3. Cardiomyopathy. No known CAD. No overt heart failure. Will plan
   repeat echo.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 20 minutes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   iron, only slightly increased TSH.  Need 9 months optimal medical
   therapy before possible consideration of ICD placement.
   - unlikely ischemic due to clean coronaries on cath here in [**2164**]
   - SPEP, UPEP pending
   - cont ASA, holding lisinopril, metoprolol and furosemide given concern
   for hypotension
   - No diuresis today given diarrhea and risk for low preload/low CO
   state. PRN 250 NS IVFboluses
   - CXR yesterday was unchanged.
   #. Lung Infiltrates:  Appreciate pulmonary recommendations.  Patient's
   infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease (related to
   methotrexate or rheumatoid arthritis) rather than pneumonia.
   - d/c
d abx, given no evidence for acute infection, augmentin may have
   caused worsening diarrhea.
   - cont nebs prn
   - repeat CXR as above unchanged
   - f/u pulm as outpatient
   #. Rhythm: Pt currently with NSR, has PAF.  Holding digoxin. Added back
   on low dose BB last night when she went back into AF with RVR with good
   response.
   - Continue heparin for AC.

   # Diarrhea: Pt reports diarrhea x ~ 2 weeks. Continues to have diarrhea
   here 4-5 episodes a day. Pt has had negative C. difficile x 3 , but was
   still started on flagyl for a total of a 10 day course.   Flagyl
   stopped last night.  Given concern for large PE and low preload,
   potentially low CO, low threshold to consider bowel ischemia should she
   decompensate or develop bloody diarrhea. Per pt and RN this am,
   diarrhea is better
   - Imodium x 1 dose
   - stool studies, including bacterial cultures, O&P  all negative
   -d/c augmentin as above.
   - replete lytes prn and hydration
   - Prelim stool studies have fecal leukocytes
   #. CAD: CE neg at OSH r/o for MI.  Focal wall-motion abnormalities
   suggest ischemic etiology.
   - Reportedly clean cath [**2164**], no plans to cath at present.
   - Cont ASA, Zocor.  Antihypertensives on hold.
   # HTN: Holding amlodipine, Imdur, lisinopril, given concern for
   hypotension.
   # Anemia: Pt with chronic anemia. Hct 34.8 today. Pt was given 2U at
   OSH. No evidence of active bleed. This is near his baseline.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Physical Examination
   Firm mass left breast that patient reports is unchanged and has been
   attributed to prior implant.
   Medical Decision Making
   1. Recurrent pulmonary embolus in setting of subtherapeutic
   anticoagulation. Continue heparin and titrate coumadin to INR [**1-26**].
    Underlying etiology not known.
   2. Abnormal CXR and CT with question interstitial lung disease.
   Pulmonary following.
   3. Cardiomyopathy. No known CAD. No overt heart failure. Will plan
   repeat echo.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 20 minutes.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2168-1-26**] 12:34 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a submassive pulmonary embolism, cardiomyopathy, and a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and prior pulmonary embolism. The patient has been started on Coumadin and Heparin, and the plan is to titrate Coumadin to an INR of 2.5-3.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk for further pulmonary emboli, especially if the underlying etiology is not identified and treated.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's cardiomyopathy is likely to worsen if not properly managed, leading to heart failure and other complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and the patient is at risk for further decline in renal function.
4. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea is ongoing, and the patient is at risk for dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is chronic, and the patient is at risk for further decline in hemoglobin levels.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is not well-controlled, and the patient is at risk for further elevation in blood pressure.
7. Depression: The patient is taking Celexa for depression, and the patient is at risk for worsening depression.

The patient's current medications include Coumadin, Heparin, Aspirin, Zocor, and Metoprolol, which are being held due to concern for hypotension. The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine, potassium, and magnesium levels, as well as anemia and chronic kidney disease.

The patient's physical examination shows a firm mass in the left breast, which is attributed to a prior implant. The patient's cardiovascular examination shows a normal sinus rhythm, with no murmurs or gallop sounds. The patient's respiratory examination shows bilateral crackles in the lung fields, and the patient's abdominal examination shows soft, non-tender abdomen.

The patient's plan includes continued management of the pulmonary embolism with Coumadin and Heparin, as well as management of the cardiomyopathy, hypertension, and anemia. The patient will be followed by the pulmonary and cardiology services, and the patient will be monitored closely for any signs of worsening of these conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 78 F with htn, HL, pafib admitted from OSH for new
   cardiomyopathy (likely ICH), question of PNA, and diarrhea, now with
   submassive pulmonary embolism.
   # Pulmonary embolism - Unclear etiology, no LE DVT on Doppler. Hx of
   prior PE. Pt was at least temporarily subtheraputic on coumadin at OSH.
   Consider lysis should he develop end organ damage/hemodynamic
   instability.
   - Heparin gtt sliding scale, consider higher INR goal for lifelong
   coumadin vs lifelong lovenox.  Discuss options with family. Start
   coumadin today vs tomorrow depending on decision.
   - IV fluid boluses 250cc as needed for blood pressure
   -SPEP, UPEP pending for hypercoag w/u, per report pt [**Name (NI) 3796**] on age
   appropriate cancer screening.
   -No evidence LE clot, no IVC filter for now.
   -renal u/s ro eval kidneys for evidence mass, thrombus.
   #. Pump. New cardiomypathy.  Pt with EF of 30-50% in [**2167-12-26**], but repeat
   ECHO in [**1-14**] showed EF 20-30%. Patient diuresed from 204 to 193.6lbs at
   [**Location (un) **] with improvement in her dyspnea.  Fixed defects on
   echocardiogram suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities
   include: infectious state given patient's recent pneumonia and chronic
   illness.  Less likely non-ischemic etilogies include rheumatologic,
   myeloma, Hepatitis, HIV and as a consequence of RV failure . Normal
   iron, only slightly increased TSH.  Need 9 months optimal medical
   therapy before possible consideration of ICD placement.
   - unlikely ischemic due to clean coronaries on cath here in [**2164**]
   - SPEP, UPEP pending
   - cont ASA, holding lisinopril, metoprolol and furosemide given concern
   for hypotension
   - No diuresis today given diarrhea and risk for low preload/low CO
   state. PRN 250 NS IVFboluses
   - CXR yesterday was unchanged.
   #. Lung Infiltrates:  Appreciate pulmonary recommendations.  Patient's
   infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease (related to
   methotrexate or rheumatoid arthritis) rather than pneumonia.
   - Nevertheless, given patient's recent complicated OSH ICU course, will
   complete antibiotic regimen and reassess
   - d/c abx, no evidence for acute infection, augmentin may be worsening
   diarrhea.
   - cont nebs prn
   - repeat CXR  as above
   #. Rhythm: Pt currently with NSR, has PAF.  Holding digoxin. Added back
   on low dose BB last night when she went back into AF with RVR with good
   response.
   - Continue heparin for AC.
   - Up titrate BB as tolerated
   - cont to monitor on telemetry
   # Renal failure. Cr 1.4 in [**2164**]; now 1.3. Currently improved from
   prior.
   - CHF compenstated but will hold diuretics for now
   - renally dose medications
   # Diarrhea: Pt reports diarrhea x ~ 2 weeks. Continues to have diarrhea
   here 4-5 episodes a day. Pt has had negative C. difficile x 3 , but was
   still started on flagyl for a total of a 10 day course.   Flagyl
   stopped last night.  Given concern for large PE and low preload,
   potentially low CO, low threshold to consider bowel ischemia should she
   decompensate or develop bloody diarrhea. Per pt and RN this am,
   diarrhea is better
   - Imodium x 1 dose
   - stool studies, including bacterial cultures, O&P  all negative
   -d/c augmentin as above.
   - replete lytes prn and hydration
   - Prelim stool studies have fecal leukocytes
   #. CAD: CE neg at OSH r/o for MI.  Focal wall-motion abnormalities
   suggest ischemic etiology.
   - Reportedly clean cath [**2164**], no plans to cath at present.
   - Cont ASA, Zocor.  Antihypertensives on hold.
   # HTN: Holding amlodipine, Imdur, lisinopril, given concern for
   hypotension.
   # Anemia: Pt with chronic anemia. Hct 34.8 today. Pt was given 2U at
   OSH. No evidence of active bleed. This is near his baseline.
   - will cont to trend
   # DM: will hold oral agents
   - monitor with QACHS FS and cover with ISS
   #. Depression: cont celexa, increased due to c/o depression

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 78 F with htn, HL, pafib admitted from OSH for new
   cardiomyopathy (likely ICH), question of PNA, and diarrhea, now with
   submassive pulmonary embolism.
   # Pulmonary embolism - Unclear etiology, no LE DVT on Doppler. Hx of
   prior PE. Pt was at least temporarily subtheraputic on coumadin at OSH.
   Consider lysis should he develop end organ damage/hemodynamic
   instability.
   - Heparin gtt sliding scale, consider higher INR goal for lifelong
   coumadin vs lifelong lovenox.  Discuss options with family. Start
   coumadin today vs tomorrow depending on decision.
   - IV fluid boluses 250cc as needed for blood pressure
   -SPEP, UPEP pending for hypercoag w/u, per report pt [**Name (NI) 3796**] on age
   appropriate cancer screening.
   -No evidence LE clot, no IVC filter for now.
   -renal u/s ro eval kidneys for evidence mass, thrombus.
   #. Pump. New cardiomypathy.  Pt with EF of 30-50% in [**2167-12-26**], but repeat
   ECHO in [**1-14**] showed EF 20-30%. Patient diuresed from 204 to 193.6lbs at
   [**Location (un) **] with improvement in her dyspnea.  Fixed defects on
   echocardiogram suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities
   include: infectious state given patient's recent pneumonia and chronic
   illness.  Less likely non-ischemic etilogies include rheumatologic,
   myeloma, Hepatitis, HIV and as a consequence of RV failure . Normal
   iron, only slightly increased TSH.  Need 9 months optimal medical
   therapy before possible consideration of ICD placement.
   - unlikely ischemic due to clean coronaries on cath here in [**2164**]
   - SPEP, UPEP pending
   - cont ASA, holding lisinopril, metoprolol and furosemide given concern
   for hypotension
   - No diuresis today given diarrhea and risk for low preload/low CO
   state. PRN 250 NS IVFboluses
   - CXR yesterday was unchanged.
   #. Lung Infiltrates:  Appreciate pulmonary recommendations.  Patient's
   infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease (related to
   methotrexate or rheumatoid arthritis) rather than pneumonia.
   - Nevertheless, given patient's recent complicated OSH ICU course, will
   complete antibiotic regimen and reassess
   - d/c abx, no evidence for acute infection, augmentin may be worsening
   diarrhea.
   - cont nebs prn
   - repeat CXR  as above
   #. Rhythm: Pt currently with NSR, has PAF.  Holding digoxin. Added back
   on low dose BB last night when she went back into AF with RVR with good
   response.
   - Continue heparin for AC.
   - Up titrate BB as tolerated
   - cont to monitor on telemetry
   # Renal failure. Cr 1.4 in [**2164**]; now 1.3. Currently improved from
   prior.
   - CHF compenstated but will hold diuretics for now
   - renally dose medications
   # Diarrhea: Pt reports diarrhea x ~ 2 weeks. Continues to have diarrhea
   here 4-5 episodes a day. Pt has had negative C. difficile x 3 , but was
   still started on flagyl for a total of a 10 day course.   Flagyl
   stopped last night.  Given concern for large PE and low preload,
   potentially low CO, low threshold to consider bowel ischemia should she
   decompensate or develop bloody diarrhea. Per pt and RN this am,
   diarrhea is better
   - Imodium x 1 dose
   - stool studies, including bacterial cultures, O&P  all negative
   -d/c augmentin as above.
   - replete lytes prn and hydration
   - Prelim stool studies have fecal leukocytes
   #. CAD: CE neg at OSH r/o for MI.  Focal wall-motion abnormalities
   suggest ischemic etiology.
   - Reportedly clean cath [**2164**], no plans to cath at present.
   - Cont ASA, Zocor.  Antihypertensives on hold.
   # HTN: Holding amlodipine, Imdur, lisinopril, given concern for
   hypotension.
   # Anemia: Pt with chronic anemia. Hct 34.8 today. Pt was given 2U at
   OSH. No evidence of active bleed. This is near his baseline.
   - will cont to trend
   # DM: will hold oral agents
   - monitor with QACHS FS and cover with ISS
   #. Depression: cont celexa, increased due to c/o depression

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a submassive pulmonary embolism, which can lead to further complications such as respiratory failure, hypotension, and even death if not treated promptly.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a new cardiomyopathy, which can lead to heart failure, arrhythmias, and decreased cardiac output.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential kidney damage. Further monitoring is necessary to prevent acute kidney injury.
4. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea is ongoing, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially life-threatening complications such as bowel ischemia.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is chronic, but the recent blood transfusion has improved his hemoglobin level. Further monitoring is necessary to prevent further anemia.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is controlled, but the patient's medications are being held due to concerns about hypotension.
7. Depression: The patient is being treated for depression, but further monitoring is necessary to ensure the patient's mental health is stable.
8. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is at risk for further infections, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
10. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for:

* Respiratory failure due to the pulmonary embolism
* Cardiac arrest due to cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias
* Renal failure due to kidney damage
* Sepsis due to infection
* Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia
* Electrolyte imbalances due to diarrhea and other factors

The patient requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent these complications and ensure their overall health and well-being."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 78 F with htn, HL, pafib admitted from OSH for new
   cardiomyopathy (likely ICH), question of PNA, and diarrhea, now with
   submassive pulmonary embolism.
   # Pulmonary embolism - Unclear etiology, no LE DVT on Doppler. Hx of
   prior PE. Pt was at least temporarily subtheraputic on coumadin at OSH
   and per family likely missed some coumadin doses . Consider lysis
   should he develop end organ damage/hemodynamic instability.
   - Heparin gtt sliding scale, consider higher INR goal, 2.5-3, will need
   lifelong coumadin, restarted last evening.
   - IV fluid boluses 250cc as needed for blood pressure
   -SPEP, UPEP pending for hypercoag w/u, per report pt [**Name (NI) 3796**] on age
   appropriate cancer screening.
   -No evidence LE clot, no IVC filter for now.
   -renal u/s negative for renal mass, thrombus.
   #. Pump. New cardiomypathy.  Pt with EF of 30-50% in [**2167-12-26**], but repeat
   ECHO in [**1-14**] showed EF 20-30%. Patient diuresed from 204 to 193.6lbs at
   [**Location (un) **] with improvement in her dyspnea.  Fixed defects on
   echocardiogram suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities
   include: infectious state given patient's recent pneumonia and chronic
   illness.  Less likely non-ischemic etilogies include rheumatologic,
   myeloma, Hepatitis, HIV and as a consequence of RV failure . Normal
   iron, only slightly increased TSH.  Need 9 months optimal medical
   therapy before possible consideration of ICD placement.
   - unlikely ischemic due to clean coronaries on cath here in [**2164**]
   - SPEP, UPEP pending
   - cont ASA, holding lisinopril, metoprolol and furosemide given concern
   for hypotension
   - No diuresis today given diarrhea and risk for low preload/low CO
   state. PRN 250 NS IVFboluses
   - CXR yesterday was unchanged.
   #. Lung Infiltrates:  Appreciate pulmonary recommendations.  Patient's
   infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease (related to
   methotrexate or rheumatoid arthritis) rather than pneumonia.
   - d/c
d abx, given no evidence for acute infection, augmentin may have
   caused worsening diarrhea.
   - cont nebs prn
   - repeat CXR as above unchanged
   - f/u pulm as outpatient
   #. Rhythm: Pt currently with NSR, has PAF.  Holding digoxin. Added back
   on low dose BB last night when she went back into AF with RVR with good
   response.
   - Continue heparin for AC.
   - Up titrate BB as tolerated
   - cont to monitor on telemetry
   # Renal failure. Cr 1.4 in [**2164**]; now at baseline. Currently improved
   from prior.
   - CHF compenstated but will hold diuretics for now
   - renally dose medications
   # Diarrhea: Pt reports diarrhea x ~ 2 weeks. Continues to have diarrhea
   here 4-5 episodes a day. Pt has had negative C. difficile x 3 , but was
   still started on flagyl for a total of a 10 day course.   Flagyl
   stopped last night.  Given concern for large PE and low preload,
   potentially low CO, low threshold to consider bowel ischemia should she
   decompensate or develop bloody diarrhea. Per pt and RN this am,
   diarrhea is better
   - Imodium x 1 dose
   - stool studies, including bacterial cultures, O&P  all negative
   -d/c augmentin as above.
   - replete lytes prn and hydration
   - Prelim stool studies have fecal leukocytes
   #. CAD: CE neg at OSH r/o for MI.  Focal wall-motion abnormalities
   suggest ischemic etiology.
   - Reportedly clean cath [**2164**], no plans to cath at present.
   - Cont ASA, Zocor.  Antihypertensives on hold.
   # HTN: Holding amlodipine, Imdur, lisinopril, given concern for
   hypotension.
   # Anemia: Pt with chronic anemia. Hct 34.8 today. Pt was given 2U at
   OSH. No evidence of active bleed. This is near his baseline.
   - will cont to trend
   # DM: will hold oral agents
   - monitor with QACHS FS and cover with ISS
   #. Depression: cont celexa, increased due to c/o depression

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and pulmonary embolism. She was admitted to the ICU for submassive pulmonary embolism, likely related to cardiomyopathy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.3°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 103/34 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination is notable for bilateral breath sounds with crackles 3/4 up on the right lung and worse on the left lung compared to yesterday. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender. Her extremities are warm, and her skin is warm.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 15.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, platelet count of 134 K/uL, and creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL. Her electrolytes are within normal limits. Her troponin-T level is 0.02 ng/mL, and her lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level is 231 IU/L.

The patient's medical history is significant for cardiomyopathy, likely related to ischemic cardiomyopathy. She has a history of prior pulmonary embolism and is currently being treated with heparin and coumadin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's submassive pulmonary embolism can worsen and lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or cardiac arrest.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's cardiomyopathy can worsen and lead to heart failure, cardiac arrest, or arrhythmias.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, which is elevated. Renal failure can worsen and lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea can worsen and lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or bowel ischemia.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen and lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, or decreased cardiac output.
6. Depression: The patient's depression can worsen and lead to suicidal ideation or decreased quality of life.
7. Infections: The patient is at risk for infections, particularly pneumonia or sepsis, given her history of cardiomyopathy and pulmonary embolism.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuation of heparin and coumadin therapy to prevent further pulmonary embolism.
2. Monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results to detect any worsening of cardiomyopathy or renal failure.
3. Management of diarrhea with anti-diarrheal medications and hydration.
4. Monitoring of anemia and adjusting therapy as necessary.
5. Continuation of depression therapy and monitoring for worsening depression.
6. Infection prevention and control measures, including stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP prevention.

The patient's disposition is planned for transfer to the floor once her condition stabilizes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 78 F with htn, HL, pafib admitted from OSH for new
   cardiomyopathy (likely ICH), question of PNA, and diarrhea, now with
   submassive pulmonary embolism.
   # Pulmonary embolism - Unclear etiology, no LE DVT on Doppler. Hx of
   prior PE. Pt was at least temporarily subtheraputic on coumadin at OSH.
   Consider lysis should he develop end organ damage/hemodynamic
   instability.
   - Heparin gtt sliding scale, consider higher INR goal for lifelong
   coumadin vs lifelong lovenox.  Discuss options with family. Start
   coumadin today vs tomorrow depending on decision.
   - IV fluid boluses 250cc as needed for blood pressure
   -SPEP, UPEP pending for hypercoag w/u, per report pt [**Name (NI) 3796**] on age
   appropriate cancer screening.
   -No evidence LE clot, no IVC filter for now.
   -renal u/s ro eval kidneys for evidence mass, thrombus.
   #. Pump. New cardiomypathy.  Pt with EF of 30-50% in [**2167-12-26**], but repeat
   ECHO in [**1-14**] showed EF 20-30%. Patient diuresed from 204 to 193.6lbs at
   [**Location (un) **] with improvement in her dyspnea.  Fixed defects on
   echocardiogram suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities
   include: infectious state given patient's recent pneumonia and chronic
   illness.  Less likely non-ischemic etilogies include rheumatologic,
   myeloma, Hepatitis, HIV and as a consequence of RV failure . Normal
   iron, only slightly increased TSH.  Need 9 months optimal medical
   therapy before possible consideration of ICD placement.
   - unlikely ischemic due to clean coronaries on cath here in [**2164**]
   - SPEP, UPEP pending
   - cont ASA, holding lisinopril, metoprolol and furosemide given concern
   for hypotension
   - No diuresis today given diarrhea and risk for low preload/low CO
   state. PRN 250 NS IVFboluses
   - CXR yesterday was unchanged.
   #. Lung Infiltrates:  Appreciate pulmonary recommendations.  Patient's
   infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease (related to
   methotrexate or rheumatoid arthritis) rather than pneumonia.
   - Nevertheless, given patient's recent complicated OSH ICU course, will
   complete antibiotic regimen and reassess
   - d/c abx, no evidence for acute infection, augmentin may be worsening
   diarrhea.
   - cont nebs prn
   - repeat CXR  as above
   #. Rhythm: Pt currently with NSR, has PAF.  Holding digoxin. Added back
   on low dose BB last night when she went back into AF with RVR with good
   response.
   - Continue heparin for AC.
   - Up titrate BB as tolerated
   - cont to monitor on telemetry
   # Renal failure. Cr 1.4 in [**2164**]; now 1.3. Currently improved from
   prior.
   - CHF compenstated but will hold diuretics for now
   - renally dose medications
   # Diarrhea: Pt reports diarrhea x ~ 2 weeks. Continues to have diarrhea
   here 4-5 episodes a day. Pt has had negative C. difficile x 3 , but was
   still started on flagyl for a total of a 10 day course.   Flagyl
   stopped last night.  Given concern for large PE and low preload,
   potentially low CO, low threshold to consider bowel ischemia should she
   decompensate or develop bloody diarrhea. Per pt and RN this am,
   diarrhea is better
   - Imodium x 1 dose
   - stool studies, including bacterial cultures, O&P  all negative
   -d/c augmentin as above.
   - replete lytes prn and hydration
   #. CAD: CE neg at OSH r/o for MI.  Focal wall-motion abnormalities
   suggest ischemic etiology.
   - Reportedly clean cath [**2164**], no plans to cath at present.
   - Cont ASA, Zocor.  Antihypertensives on hold.
   # HTN: Holding amlodipine, Imdur, lisinopril, given concern for
   hypotension.
   # Anemia: Pt with chronic anemia. Hct 34.8 today. Pt was given 2U at
   OSH. No evidence of active bleed. This is near his baseline.
   - will cont to trend
   # DM: will hold oral agents
   - monitor with QACHS FS and cover with ISS
   #. Depression: cont celexa, increased due to c/o depression

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Patient Information:**

* Age: 78 years old
* Chief Complaint: Pulmonary embolism
* Admitted with cardiomyopathy (likely ICH), question of PNA, and diarrhea

**Current Status:**

* Vital signs: Stable, with a temperature of 98.3°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 103/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 98%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Patient is on Heparin sodium infusion and Coumadin (Warfarin) 2.5mg PO daily
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula oxygen delivery, with an ABG result of //25/
* Cardiovascular: Patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and pulmonary embolism
* Renal function: Creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, with a slight improvement from previous values
* Gastrointestinal: Patient has a history of diarrhea, with a recent 10-day course of Flagyl and ongoing diarrhea
* Neurological: Patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and is oriented to person, place, and time

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Pulmonary Embolism:** The patient has a submassive pulmonary embolism, which can lead to further embolization, respiratory failure, and death.
2. **Cardiomyopathy:** The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy, which can lead to heart failure, arrhythmias, and decreased cardiac output.
3. **Renal Failure:** The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which can lead to further kidney damage, electrolyte imbalances, and end-stage renal disease.
4. **Diarrhea:** The patient's ongoing diarrhea can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and bowel ischemia.
5. **Bowel Ischemia:** The patient's history of diarrhea and recent Flagyl treatment may increase the risk of bowel ischemia, which can lead to perforation, abscess, and sepsis.
6. **Hypotension:** The patient's history of hypertension, hypotension, and recent medication changes may increase the risk of hypotension, which can lead to decreased cardiac output, organ dysfunction, and death.
7. **Infectious Complications:** The patient's recent pneumonia and chronic illness may increase the risk of further infectious complications, such as sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections.
8. **Thrombotic Complications:** The patient's history of pulmonary embolism and recent anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke.

**Plan:**

1. Continue anticoagulation therapy with Heparin sodium infusion and Coumadin (Warfarin) 2.5mg PO daily.
2. Monitor vital signs, hemodynamic status, and respiratory function closely.
3. Continue IV fluid boluses as needed for blood pressure management.
4. Monitor renal function and adjust medications accordingly.
5. Continue antihypertensive therapy, but hold medications that may exacerbate hypotension.
6. Monitor for signs of bowel ischemia, such as bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever.
7. Consider lysis therapy if the patient develops end-organ damage or hemodynamic instability.
8. Continue antibiotic therapy for pneumonia, but discontinue Augmentin due to worsening diarrhea.
9. Monitor for signs of sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections, and treat promptly if necessary.
10. Consider ICD placement after 9 months of optimal medical therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-inch tall individual with a pulmonary embolism (PE) and is being treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure of 103/34 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 98%.

The patient has been started on Coumadin 2.5mg PO daily, in place of Lovenox, and is scheduled for an outpatient hematology/oncology appointment for hypercoagulation workup. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and creatinine levels, as well as elevated troponin-T levels. The patient's PT, PTT, and INR levels are elevated, indicating bleeding risk.

The patient has impaired skin integrity, pulmonary embolism, cardiomyopathy, and diarrhea. The patient is receiving nutrition support, glycemic control, and has multiple IV lines in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding risk: The patient's elevated PT, PTT, and INR levels indicate a bleeding risk, which may be exacerbated by the use of Coumadin.
2. Hypercoagulation: The patient's pulmonary embolism and elevated D-dimer levels may indicate a hypercoagulation state, which could lead to further thrombotic events.
3. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's elevated troponin-T levels and cardiomyopathy diagnosis suggest a risk of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and heart failure.
4. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, which could exacerbate the patient's underlying conditions.
5. Worsening of pulmonary embolism: The patient's pulmonary embolism may worsen if not properly treated, leading to respiratory failure and other complications.
6. Skin breakdown: The patient's impaired skin integrity may lead to further skin breakdown and infection if not properly managed.
7. Infection: The patient's multiple IV lines and use of antibiotics may increase the risk of infection, particularly catheter-related infections."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 78 F with htn, HL, pafib admitted from OSH for new
   cardiomyopathy (likely ICH), question of PNA, and diarrhea, now with
   submassive pulmonary embolism.
   # Pulmonary embolism - Unclear etiology, no LE DVT on Doppler. Hx of
   prior PE. Pt was at least temporarily subtheraputic on coumadin at OSH.
   Consider lysis should he develop end organ damage/hemodynamic
   instability.
   - Heparin gtt sliding scale, consider higher INR goal for lifelong
   coumadin vs lifelong lovenox.  Discuss options with family. Start
   coumadin today vs tomorrow depending on decision.
   - IV fluid boluses 250cc as needed for blood pressure
   -SPEP, UPEP pending for hypercoag w/u, per report pt [**Name (NI) 3796**] on age
   appropriate cancer screening.
   -No evidence LE clot, no IVC filter for now.
   -renal u/s ro eval kidneys for evidence mass, thrombus.
   #. Pump. New cardiomypathy.  Pt with EF of 30-50% in [**2167-12-26**], but repeat
   ECHO in [**1-14**] showed EF 20-30%. Patient diuresed from 204 to 193.6lbs at
   [**Location (un) **] with improvement in her dyspnea.  Fixed defects on
   echocardiogram suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities
   include: infectious state given patient's recent pneumonia and chronic
   illness.  Less likely non-ischemic etilogies include rheumatologic,
   myeloma, Hepatitis, HIV and as a consequence of RV failure . Normal
   iron, only slightly increased TSH.  Need 9 months optimal medical
   therapy before possible consideration of ICD placement.
   - unlikely ischemic due to clean coronaries on cath here in [**2164**]
   - SPEP, UPEP pending
   - cont ASA, holding lisinopril, metoprolol and furosemide given concern
   for hypotension
   - No diuresis today given diarrhea and risk for low preload/low CO
   state. PRN 250 NS IVFboluses
   - CXR today
   #. Lung Infiltrates:  Appreciate pulmonary recommendations.  Patient's
   infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease (related to
   methotrexate or rheumatoid arthritis) rather than pneumonia.
   - Nevertheless, given patient's recent complicated OSH ICU course, will
   complete antibiotic regimen and reassess
   - d/c abx, no evidence for acute infection, augmentin may be worsening
   diarrhea.
   - cont nebs prn
   - repeat CXR  as above
   #. Rhythm: Pt currently with NSR, has PAF.  Holding digoxin. Added back
   on low dose BB last night when she went back into AF with RVR with good
   response.
   - Continue heparin for AC.
   - Up titrate BB as tolerated
   - cont to monitor on telemetry
   # Renal failure. Cr 1.4 in [**2164**]; now 1.3. Currently improved from
   prior.
   - CHF compenstated but will hold diuretics for now
   - renally dose medications
   # Diarrhea: Pt reports diarrhea x ~ 2 weeks. Continues to have diarrhea
   here 4-5 episodes a day. Pt has had negative C. difficile x 3 , but was
   still started on flagyl for a total of a 10 day course.   Flagyl
   stopped last night.  Given concern for large PE and low preload,
   potentially low CO, low threshold to consider bowel ischemia should she
   decompensate or develop bloody diarrhea. Per pt and RN this am,
   diarrhea is better
   - Imodium x 1 dose
   - stool studies, including bacterial cultures, O&P  all negative
   -d/c augmentin as above.
   - replete lytes prn and hydration
   #. CAD: CE neg at OSH r/o for MI.  Focal wall-motion abnormalities
   suggest ischemic etiology.
   - Reportedly clean cath [**2164**], no plans to cath at present.
   - Cont ASA, Zocor.  Antihypertensives on hold.
   # HTN: Holding amlodipine, Imdur, lisinopril, given concern for
   hypotension.
   # Anemia: Pt with chronic anemia. Hct 34.8 today. Pt was given 2U at
   OSH. No evidence of active bleed. This is near his baseline.
   - will cont to trend
   # DM: will hold oral agents
   - monitor with QACHS FS and cover with ISS
   #. Depression: cont celexa, increased due to c/o depression

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   coumadin vs lifelong lovenox.  Discuss options with family. Start
   coumadin today vs tomorrow depending on decision.
   - IV fluid boluses 250cc as needed for blood pressure
   -SPEP, UPEP pending for hypercoag w/u, per report pt [**Name (NI) 3796**] on age
   appropriate cancer screening.
   -No evidence LE clot, no IVC filter for now.
   -renal u/s ro eval kidneys for evidence mass, thrombus.
   #. Pump. New cardiomypathy.  Pt with EF of 30-50% in [**2167-12-26**], but repeat
   ECHO in [**1-14**] showed EF 20-30%. Patient diuresed from 204 to 193.6lbs at
   [**Location (un) **] with improvement in her dyspnea.  Fixed defects on
   echocardiogram suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities
   include: infectious state given patient's recent pneumonia and chronic
   illness.  Less likely non-ischemic etilogies include rheumatologic,
   myeloma, Hepatitis, HIV and as a consequence of RV failure . Normal
   iron, only slightly increased TSH.  Need 9 months optimal medical
   therapy before possible consideration of ICD placement.
   - unlikely ischemic due to clean coronaries on cath here in [**2164**]
   - SPEP, UPEP pending
   - cont ASA, holding lisinopril, metoprolol and furosemide given concern
   for hypotension
   - No diuresis today given diarrhea and risk for low preload/low CO
   state. PRN 250 NS IVFboluses
   - CXR today
   #. Lung Infiltrates:  Appreciate pulmonary recommendations.  Patient's
   infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease (related to
   methotrexate or rheumatoid arthritis) rather than pneumonia.
   - Nevertheless, given patient's recent complicated OSH ICU course, will
   complete antibiotic regimen and reassess
   - d/c abx, no evidence for acute infection, augmentin may be worsening
   diarrhea.
   - cont nebs prn
   - repeat CXR  as above
   #. Rhythm: Pt currently with NSR, has PAF.  Holding digoxin. Added back
   on low dose BB last night when she went back into AF with RVR with good
   response.
   - Continue heparin for AC.
   - Up titrate BB as tolerated
   - cont to monitor on telemetry
   # Renal failure. Cr 1.4 in [**2164**]; now 1.3. Currently improved from
   prior.
   - CHF compenstated but will hold diuretics for now
   - renally dose medications
   # Diarrhea: Pt reports diarrhea x ~ 2 weeks. Continues to have diarrhea
   here 4-5 episodes a day. Pt has had negative C. difficile x 3 , but was
   still started on flagyl for a total of a 10 day course.   Flagyl
   stopped last night.  Given concern for large PE and low preload,
   potentially low CO, low threshold to consider bowel ischemia should she
   decompensate or develop bloody diarrhea. Per pt and RN this am,
   diarrhea is better
   - Imodium x 1 dose
   - stool studies, including bacterial cultures, O&P  all negative
   -d/c augmentin as above.
   - replete lytes prn and hydration
   #. CAD: CE neg at OSH r/o for MI.  Focal wall-motion abnormalities
   suggest ischemic etiology.
   - Reportedly clean cath [**2164**], no plans to cath at present.
   - Cont ASA, Zocor.  Antihypertensives on hold.
   # HTN: Holding amlodipine, Imdur, lisinopril, given concern for
   hypotension.
   # Anemia: Pt with chronic anemia. Hct 34.8 today. Pt was given 2U at
   OSH. No evidence of active bleed. This is near his baseline.
   - will cont to trend
   # DM: will hold oral agents
   - monitor with QACHS FS and cover with ISS
   #. Depression: cont celexa, increased due to c/o depression

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cardiomyopathy. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure of 103/34 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 98%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 15.0, hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, platelet count of 134,000/μL, and creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL. The patient's coagulation studies show an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.6, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 90.4 seconds, and activated clotting time (ACT) of 17.9 seconds.

The patient's medical history includes a history of prior PE, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cardiomyopathy. The patient's medications include coumadin, heparin, and aspirin.

The patient's physical examination reveals a pulse oximetry reading of 98%, and the patient is responsive to verbal stimuli. The patient's skin is pale, and the patient has no evidence of peripheral edema.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is being treated with heparin and coumadin, and the patient's INR will be monitored.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's ejection fraction is 20-30%, and the patient's fixed defects on echocardiogram suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy.
3. Lung infiltrates: The patient's infiltrates may suggest chronic interstitial lung disease, but the patient's recent complicated ICU course suggests that the patient may have pneumonia.
4. Rhythm: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm, but the patient has a history of atrial fibrillation.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL, and the patient is being treated with diuretics.
6. Diarrhea: The patient has had diarrhea for 2 weeks, and the patient's stool studies have been negative for C. difficile and other pathogens.
7. CAD: The patient's coronary arteries are clean, and the patient's focal wall-motion abnormalities suggest ischemic etiology.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk for further pulmonary embolism, and the patient's INR will need to be monitored to ensure that it is within the therapeutic range.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's cardiomyopathy can worsen, and the patient may develop heart failure.
3. Lung infiltrates: The patient's lung infiltrates may worsen, and the patient may develop pneumonia.
4. Rhythm: The patient's rhythm can change, and the patient may develop atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
5. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure can worsen, and the patient may develop acute kidney injury.
6. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea can worsen, and the patient may develop dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.
7. CAD: The patient's CAD can worsen, and the patient may develop myocardial infarction or unstable angina.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue heparin and coumadin for pulmonary embolism.
2. Monitor the patient's INR and adjust the patient's anticoagulation therapy as needed.
3. Continue diuretics for renal failure.
4. Monitor the patient's stool output and electrolyte levels to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Continue antibiotics for pneumonia, if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's rhythm and adjust the patient's anticoagulation therapy as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiomyopathy and adjust the patient's medications as needed.

In summary, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a submassive pulmonary embolism, cardiomyopathy, and lung infiltrates. The patient is at risk for further pulmonary embolism, cardiomyopathy, lung infiltrates, and other complications. The patient's plan of care includes monitoring the patient's INR and adjusting the patient's anticoagulation therapy as needed, continuing diuretics for renal failure, and monitoring the patient's stool output and electrolyte levels to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalances."
