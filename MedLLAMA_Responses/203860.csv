   Please see MICU admission note dated [**2149-9-24**] for further details.
   Briefly, Mr. [**Known lastname 7685**] is a 63 y.o. M with ESLD [**2-10**] ETOH cirrhosis c/b
   hepatic encephalopathy, admitted to MICU [**Location (un) **] on [**2149-9-24**] for altered
   mental status.  He had two recent admissions prior to this one.
   [**Date range (1) 8028**]: R axillary hematoma requiring massive blood product
   resuscitation.  [**Date range (1) 8675**]: R groin bleed which achieved hemostasis with
   DDAVP and aminocaproic acid.  On the evening of [**9-22**], pt's sister noted
   that he had normal mental status.  The following morning, he appeared
   confused and was not eating and had not used the bathroom.  Symptoms
   progressed and by the evening, he was awake but not verbal.  Sister
   brought him to [**Name (NI) **].
   .
   In the ED, initial VS: T 97  HR 73  BP 127/68  RR 24  100% 2 L NC.
   Paracentesis negative for SBP. RUQ US which showed GB sludge and patent
   portal vein. Received 1 L NS and flagyl 500 mg IV x 1. Transferred to
   ICU.
   .
   From [**Date range (1) 8676**], pt was in MICU [**Location (un) **].  His altered mental status was
   treated with lactulose and etiology likely medication noncompliance.
   ARF of 1.9 from baseline 0.8.  Fluid boluses given with resolution of
   ARF.  Also had BRBPR in ED, and [**Hospital1 **] Hcts monitored. Ceftriaxone IV was
   continued for ppx.  On [**9-26**], the patient was transferred to Liver
   Kidney Service ([**Hospital Ward Name 408**] 10).
   .
   From [**Date range (1) 8677**], the [**Hospital 1050**] hospital course was the following:
   * Altered mental status: treating with lactulose, rifaximin
   * ARF: first thought to be pre-renal [**2-10**] poor po intake, held
   diuretics, and resolved.  Re-initiated diuretics on [**9-28**], lasix held on
   [**10-1**].  Cr trended up on [**10-5**] and treated with albumin challenge x 2
   days and transfused with pRBC. Cr continued to trend up. Started
   midodrine and octreotide on [**10-15**]. Renal consulted, felt likely HRS and
   less likely abdominal compartment syndrome.
   * BRBPR: NG without gross blood. Hct trended.
   * Metabolic acidosis: Non AG noted which was felt to be due to diarrhea
   and r/o RTA Type 2 with urine lytes.
   * Diarrhea: Around [**2149-9-30**], pt noted to have 2.5 L watery profuse stool
   with c. diff negative. [**Month/Day/Year **] negative, CT abdomen/pelvis completed.
   * UTI: treated with ciprofloxacin x 3 days ([**10-2**])
   * Ileus/Pseudo-obstruction: On [**10-5**], CT showed stable ileus of
   transverse colon on CT and KUB. Pt still passing flatus. Flex sig on
   [**10-6**] with bowel decompression. Pt initially refused rectal tube, but
   then consented on [**10-8**]. Pt's HR and BP too low for neostigmmine.
   Surgery consulted. Started on reglan [**10-13**] without significant
   improvement.
   * Coagulopathy: Multifactorial from lupus anticoagulant and liver
   dysfunction. Large chest wall hematoma found on CT on [**10-15**].  Monitored
   with serial Hcts.
   .
   On [**10-18**], MICU consult was requested due to patient's altered mental
   status secondary to high dose narcotic. Narcan x 3 given with
   improvement in mental status.  ICU transfer deferred.
   .
   On [**10-19**], pt was transferred to MICU service due to traumatic foley
   placement with bleeding from site as well as bleeding from 3 L
   abdominal paracentesis site that was performed on [**10-18**].  He was given
   1 pRBC and 4 FFP.  Patient was called out to the floor on [**10-20**].
   .
   On [**10-26**], transferred back to the MICU for melenic stool and HCT drop
   from 23>17.  Pt without complaint.  Brown stool shortly after arrival
   but hematoma on posterior chest wall appears expanded

   lengthy hospital course c/b colonic pseudo-obstruction, traumatic foley
   placement, and bleeding from paracentesis site, transferred to ICU for
   hemodynamic monitoring.
   .
   # Blood Clot  PR x 1: Stable. H/o hemorrhoids on previous colonsocopy
   and varices on EGD (4 grade 1). Also with lupus anticoagulant.   Had
   bowel movement after coming to the ICU which was guaiac negative.
   - trend Hct, type and screen, transfuse for Hct < 22
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Has underlying liver disease as well as lupus
   anticoagulant positive.  Pt also with bleeding from abdominal para site
   and s/p traumatic foley placement
   - s/p vitamin K po x 1
   - FFP for INR > 2
   - Transfuse for HCT<22
   - Cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen < 100
   - DDAVP given, repeat PRN
   - s/p topical thrombin for abdominal wall site
   - Can use amicar for uncontrolled bleeding if necessary; dose 5gram
   loading dose over 1 hour followed by 5mg PO (check dosing interval)
   - trend Hct, plt's, INR and fibrinogen q 4 hours
   - CT scan chest wall to evaluate for expansion of hematoma
   - if rebleeds into hematoma, it is unlikely that they would be able to
   intervene because a permanent bloackade was placed in the artery
   .
   # Chest Wall Hematoma: Has been stable by imaging with ? evidence of
   slow ooze by most recent CT.
   - repeat CT to evaluate for expansion of clot
   - follow clinically
   - correct coagulopathy
   .
   # Traumatic foley placement: Pt continues to ooze from urethra around
   catheter. Per urology, foley should be continued for at least one
   week.
   - serial hcts daily
   - bladder irrigation if clots in foley bag
   - penile u/s ordered to look for urethral tear
   .
   # Abdominal Wall Bleeding: Several small hematoma in abdomen, ascitic
   fluid w/o stigmata of bleeding, and otherwise notable for massive
   ascites.
   - correct coagulopathy as above
   - active T&S
   - transfuse for Hct<22 or active bleeding, HD instability
   .
   # Colonic Pseudo-obstruction: Has failed rectal tube, did not tolerate
   NG tube, sigmoidoscopy did not result in decompression for any
   sustained period, and high risk for neostigmine given bradycardia and
   risk of heart block.
   - weekly KUBs (tomorrow)
   .
   # ESLD: Not transplant candidate given active drinking.  Plans to have
   transplant eval at [**Hospital1 **].  [**Month (only) 11**] now have hepatorenal syndrome which will
   not be helped by acute blood loss
   - transplant eval at [**Hospital1 **] on discharge
   - measure bladder pressures to r/o compartment syndrome as ascites
   reaccumulates
   .
   # Acute renal failure: likely 2/2 HRS
   - continue midodrine, octreotide
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   # Diarrhea - Chronic, likely combination of lactulose and
   nonobstructing ileus. Colonic ileus is stable by CT and KUB. non-gap
   metabolic acidosis continues, but still likely related to diarrhea.
   Patient ambulating to bedside commode without problems. [**Name (NI) **] negative
   for celiac disease.
   - monitor labs including lytes
   - holding lactulose for now
   - replete lytes prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with ESLD (cirrhosis) and a lengthy hospital course. The patient has a history of bleeding, including a large blood clot per rectum, and has been experiencing altered mental status, anemia, and coagulopathy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Altered mental status: treated with lactulose and rifaximin
* Anemia: with a current HCT of 17
* Coagulopathy: multifactorial from lupus anticoagulant and liver dysfunction
* Colonic pseudo-obstruction: with a stable ileus on CT and KUB
* Traumatic foley placement: with ongoing bleeding from the urethra
* Abdominal wall bleeding: with several small hematomas and massive ascites
* ESLD: with hepatorenal syndrome and a plan for transplant evaluation
* Acute renal failure: likely due to hepatorenal syndrome
* Diarrhea: chronic and likely related to lactulose and non-obstructing ileus
* Mental status: opiate sedation resolving, with mild asterixis

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further bleeding from the urethra or abdominal wall
* Expansion of the chest wall hematoma
* Development of compartment syndrome in the abdomen or chest
* Further deterioration of the patient's liver function
* Worsening of the patient's renal function
* Development of sepsis or other infections
* Further complications related to the patient's ESLD and coagulopathy

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Correction of coagulopathy with vitamin K, FFP, and cryoprecipitate
* Transfusion of blood products as needed
* Monitoring of the patient's HCT, plt's, INR, and fibrinogen levels
* Repeat CT scans to evaluate for expansion of the chest wall hematoma
* Serial HCTs to monitor for ongoing bleeding
* Weekly KUBs to monitor for colonic pseudo-obstruction
* Measurement of bladder pressures to rule out compartment syndrome
* Transplant evaluation and potential listing for liver transplant
* Ongoing management of the patient's ESLD, including lactulose and rifaximin therapy
* Monitoring of the patient's mental status and avoiding narcotics and sedating medications."

   Assessment and Plan
   63M with ETOH cirrhosis complicated by hepatic encephalopathy,
   esophageal varices, and coagulopathy with lengthy hospital course for
   colonic pseudoobstruction s/p endoscopic decompression, traumatic foley
   placement, bleeding from paracentesis site, and chest wall hematoma
   status post embolization x2, transferred back to ICU for hemodynamic
   monitoring in the setting of acute blood loss anemia.
   .
   #Acute blood loss anemia
 multiple sources with reexpansion of chest
   wall hematoma, GU bleeding (less likely GI given brown BM with negative
   guaiac); presently hemostatic, Hct responded to supportive therapy with
   blood & factors but complicated by comorbid ESLD coagulopathy and
   likely DIC

   -guaiac stools
   -appreciate surgery involvement
   .
   #Coagulopathy: ESLD, lupus anticoagulant positive; has required ddavp &
   amicar in the past; s/p topical thrombin for abdominal wall site
   - labs q4h until clearly stabilized
   - FFP for INR > 2, cryo for fibrinogen < 100
   - DDAVP given in past, repeat PRN
   - consider amicar for uncontrolled bleeding; dose 5gram loading dose
   over 1 hour followed by 5mg PO (check dosing interval)
   - f/u blood, urine Cx

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with ETOH cirrhosis, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, and coagulopathy, who was transferred back to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring due to acute blood loss anemia. The patient has a lengthy hospital course with multiple complications, including colonic pseudoobstruction, traumatic foley placement, bleeding from paracentesis site, and chest wall hematoma status post embolization.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Acute blood loss anemia with multiple sources of bleeding, including re-expansion of chest wall hematoma, GU bleeding, and possible GI bleeding
* Coagulopathy due to ESLD and lupus anticoagulant positivity, requiring DDAVP and amicar in the past
* Traumatic foley placement with ongoing bleeding around the catheter
* Colonic pseudoobstruction with failed rectal tube and endoscopic decompression
* ESLD with no evidence of florid encephalopathy
* Acute renal failure likely due to Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS)
* Jaundice and warm skin

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued bleeding from multiple sources, including chest wall hematoma and GU bleeding
* Development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to coagulopathy
* Worsening of acute renal failure and potential need for dialysis
* Increased risk of infection due to prolonged hospital stay and compromised immune function
* Potential for further liver decompensation and worsening of ESLD
* Need for continued monitoring and management of coagulopathy, bleeding, and liver function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y.o. M with ESLD [**2-10**] ETOH cirrhosis c/b hepatic encephalopathy with
   lengthy hospital course c/b colonic pseudo-obstruction, traumatic foley
   placement, and bleeding from paracentesis site, transferred to ICU for
   hemodynamic monitoring.
   .
   # Blood Clot  PR x 1: Stable. H/o hemorrhoids on previous colonsocopy
   and varices on EGD (4 grade 1). Also with lupus anticoagulant.   Had
   bowel movement after coming to the ICU which was guaiac negative.
   - trend Hct, type and screen, transfuse for Hct < 22
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Has underlying liver disease as well as lupus
   anticoagulant positive.  Pt also with bleeding from abdominal para site
   and s/p traumatic foley placement
   - s/p vitamin K po x 1
   - FFP for INR > 2
   - Transfuse for HCT<22
   - Cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen < 100
   - DDAVP given in past, repeat PRN
   - s/p topical thrombin for abdominal wall site
   - Can use amicar for uncontrolled bleeding if necessary; dose 5gram
   loading dose over 1 hour followed by 5mg PO (check dosing interval)
   - trend Hct, plt's, INR and fibrinogen q 4 hours
   - CT scan chest wall showed no expansion of hematoma
   - if rebleeds into hematoma, it is unlikely that they would be able to
   intervene because a permanent bloackade was placed in the artery
   .
   # Chest Wall Hematoma: Has been stable by imaging with ? evidence of
   slow ooze by most recent CT.
   - repeat CT showed stable
   - follow clinically
   - correct coagulopathy
   .
   # Traumatic foley placement: Pt continues to ooze from urethra around
   catheter. Per urology, foley should be continued for at least one
   week.
   - serial hcts daily
   - bladder irrigation if clots in foley bag
   - penile u/s ordered to look for urethral tear
   - urology following
   .
   # Abdominal Wall Bleeding: Several small hematoma in abdomen, ascitic
   fluid w/o stigmata of bleeding, and otherwise notable for massive
   ascites.
   - correct coagulopathy as above
   - active T&S
   - transfuse for Hct<22 or active bleeding, HD instability
   .
   # Colonic Pseudo-obstruction: Has failed rectal tube, did not tolerate
   NG tube, sigmoidoscopy did not result in decompression for any
   sustained period, and high risk for neostigmine given bradycardia and
   risk of heart block.
   - weekly KUBs (tomorrow)
   .
   # ESLD: Not transplant candidate given active drinking.  Plans to have
   transplant eval at [**Hospital1 **].  [**Month (only) 11**] now have hepatorenal syndrome which will
   not be helped by acute blood loss
   - transplant eval at [**Hospital1 **] on discharge
   - measure bladder pressures to r/o compartment syndrome as ascites
   reaccumulates
   - Liver following
   .
   # Acute renal failure: likely 2/2 HRS
   - continue midodrine, octreotide
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   # Diarrhea - Chronic, likely combination of lactulose and
   nonobstructing ileus. Colonic ileus is stable by CT and KUB. non-gap
   metabolic acidosis continues, but still likely related to diarrhea.
   Patient ambulating to bedside commode without problems. [**Name (NI) **] negative

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with ESLD due to ETOH cirrhosis, who has been admitted to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring. The patient has a complex medical history, including:

1. Coagulopathy: The patient has underlying liver disease, lupus anticoagulant, and bleeding from the abdominal para site and traumatic foley placement. He is receiving vitamin K, FFP, and cryoprecipitate to correct his coagulopathy.
2. Chest Wall Hematoma: The patient has a large right chest wall hematoma, which is stable by imaging, with evidence of slow ooze. The patient is being followed clinically, and his coagulopathy is being corrected.
3. Traumatic Foley Placement: The patient continues to ooze from the urethra around the catheter, and the urology team has recommended continuing the foley for at least one week.
4. Abdominal Wall Bleeding: The patient has several small hematomas in the abdomen, ascitic fluid without stigmata of bleeding, and massive ascites. His coagulopathy is being corrected, and he is being actively transfused.
5. Colonic Pseudo-obstruction: The patient has failed rectal tube, NG tube, and sigmoidoscopy, and is at high risk for neostigmine given bradycardia and risk of heart block.
6. ESLD: The patient is not a transplant candidate due to active drinking, and is scheduled to have a transplant evaluation at [**Hospital1**].
7. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has likely developed hepatorenal syndrome, which will not be helped by acute blood loss.
8. Diarrhea: The patient has chronic diarrhea, likely related to lactulose and non-obstructing ileus.
9. Mental Status: The patient has mild asterixis and is being weaned off opiate sedation.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Further bleeding from the chest wall, abdominal para site, and traumatic foley placement.
2. Development of sepsis or organ failure due to the patient's underlying liver disease and coagulopathy.
3. Progression of the patient's acute renal failure to chronic kidney disease.
4. Complications from the patient's colonic pseudo-obstruction, such as bowel perforation or obstruction.
5. Further deterioration of the patient's mental status due to ongoing opiate sedation and underlying liver disease.

Given the patient's complex medical history and ongoing medical complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of his conditions to prevent further deterioration and potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a complex medical history, including ETOH cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, and coagulopathy. He is currently admitted to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring due to acute blood loss anemia, which is complicated by comorbid ESLD coagulopathy and likely DIC.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* T: 36.3°C (97.4°F)
* HR: 61 bpm
* BP: 113/66 mmHg
* RR: 16 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hct: 21.1% (decreased)
* Plt: 66,000/μL (decreased)
* Cr: 2.0 mg/dL (elevated)
* Glucose: 124 mg/dL (normal)
* INR: 2.1 (elevated)
* Fibrinogen: 130 mg/dL (normal)
* LDH: 334 IU/L (elevated)
* Ca++: 10.0 mg/dL (normal)
* Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL (normal)
* PO4: 3.5 mg/dL (normal)

The patient has a history of traumatic foley placement, which is still present, and is oozing from the urethra around the catheter. He also has a positive U/A and dysuria, which may be related to the traumatic foley placement.

The patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including:

1. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and likely DIC make him at high risk for bleeding, particularly in the setting of traumatic foley placement.
2. Infection: The patient's positive U/A and dysuria may indicate a urinary tract infection, which could worsen his condition.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's likely HRS and ongoing bleeding make him at risk for further deterioration of his renal function.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's ESLD and ongoing bleeding may exacerbate his hepatic encephalopathy, which could worsen his overall condition.
5. Sepsis: The patient's positive U/A and dysuria, along with his ongoing bleeding, make him at risk for sepsis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Monitoring of Hct every 8 hours, with transfusion for Hct < 21% or < 25% if active rebleeding.
2. Active T&S, with transfusion for Hct < 21% or < 25% if active rebleeding.
3. Guaiac stools to monitor for GI bleeding.
4. Coagulation factor replacement, including FFP and cryo, as needed.
5. DDAVP given as needed to control bleeding.
6. Amicar given as needed to control bleeding, with dose adjustment based on response.
7. Empiric ampicillin for suspected UTI, with f/u UCx.
8. Foley catheter continued for at least one week, with urology follow-up.
9. Bladder irrigation if clots are present in the foley bag.
10. Goals of care discussion with the patient and family, given ongoing ETOH use prior to admission.

In summary, the patient is a high-risk individual with a complex medical history, who is at risk for several potential medical complications. Close monitoring and management of his coagulopathy, bleeding, and potential infections are critical to preventing further deterioration of his condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a lengthy hospital course for colonic pseudoobstruction, traumatic foley placement, bleeding from paracentesis site, and chest wall hematoma. He has a history of ethanol cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, and coagulopathy. The patient's current condition is complicated by acute blood loss anemia, multiple sources of bleeding, and reexpansion of chest wall hematoma. He has a decreased hematocrit (Hct) level of 21.1%, indicating anemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 61 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His temperature is 36.3°C.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.3, platelet count of 66, and creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL, indicating acute renal failure. His liver function tests are abnormal, with a bilirubin level of 8.1 mg/dL and an albumin level of 2.2 mg/dL.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Hepatorenal syndrome
2. Hepatic encephalopathy
3. Hemorrhage/ hematoma, procedure-related
4. Acute blood loss anemia
5. Coagulopathy
6. UTI
7. Traumatic foley placement
8. Colonic pseudoobstruction
9. ESLD (end-stage liver disease)
10. Acute renal failure

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Further bleeding or hematoma expansion
2. Development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
3. Septic shock due to UTI or other infections
4. Hepatic encephalopathy worsening
5. Acute kidney injury or worsening of acute renal failure
6. Hypoglycemia due to liver dysfunction
7. Electrolyte imbalances due to liver dysfunction
8. Increased risk of infections due to immunosuppression
9. Cardiovascular complications due to coagulopathy and liver dysfunction

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Monitoring of Hct levels every 8 hours and transfusing blood products as needed
2. Coagulation factor replacement as needed
3. Empiric antibiotics for UTI
4. Foley catheter management
5. Colonic pseudoobstruction management
6. ESLD management, including lactulose hold and ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis
7. Acute renal failure management, including midodrine and octreotide
8. Nutrition management, including TPN when PICC is placed
9. Glycemic control management
10. Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Patient Condition:**

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a lengthy hospital course for colonic pseudoobstruction, traumatic foley placement, bleeding from paracentesis site, and chest wall hematoma. He has a history of ethanol cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, and coagulopathy. The patient is currently in the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring due to acute blood loss anemia.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Acute Blood Loss Anemia:** The patient's hemoglobin level has stabilized, but he is at risk for further bleeding due to his coagulopathy and possible superimposed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
2. **Coagulopathy:** The patient's coagulopathy is complicated by his ESLD and lupus anticoagulant positivity. He requires close monitoring of his coagulation factors and may need transfusions to prevent bleeding.
3. **Urinary Tract Infection (UTI):** The patient has a positive urine culture and is at risk for further infection due to his traumatic foley placement and UTI.
4. **Colonic Pseudoobstruction:** The patient's colonic pseudoobstruction has not resolved, and he may require further interventions to manage this condition.
5. **Acute Renal Failure:** The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and may require further management with midodrine and octreotide.
6. **Hepatic Encephalopathy:** The patient's hepatic encephalopathy is not florid, but he is at risk for further deterioration due to his ESLD.
7. **Catheter-Associated Complications:** The patient's traumatic foley placement and ongoing bleeding from the urethra around the catheter may lead to further complications, such as sepsis or peritonitis.

**Assessment and Plan:**

The patient's plan includes monitoring his hemoglobin level, coagulation factors, and renal function, as well as managing his UTI, colonic pseudoobstruction, and acute renal failure. The patient will also require close monitoring of his catheter and may need further interventions to manage his bleeding and prevent further complications."

   - HCT dropped from 23 to 20.5.  Transfused 1 u PRBC and 1 u cryo.  HCT
   bumped to 22.3.
   - Heme clarified the the factor inhibitor on the screen is lupus
   anticoagulant, which should not be associated with bleeding.  Bleeding
   is felt to be due to liver-related factor deficiencies and chronic
   DIC.  Recommended cryo, FFP.  Would avoid Amicar.
   - Liver reported that they are still evaluating him for transplant.
   This will mainly depend on if he has enough social support.  If he
   does, then Liver will discuss with Transplant Surgery.

   Assessment and Plan
   63M with ETOH cirrhosis complicated by hepatic encephalopathy,
   esophageal varices, and coagulopathy with lengthy hospital course for
   colonic pseudoobstruction s/p endoscopic decompression, traumatic foley
   placement, bleeding from paracentesis site, and chest wall hematoma
   status post embolization x2, transferred back to ICU for hemodynamic
   monitoring in the setting of acute blood loss anemia.
   #Acute blood loss anemia
 Hct stabilized; multiple sources with
   reexpansion of chest wall hematoma, GU bleeding (less likely GI given
   brown BM with negative guaiac); presently hemostatic, Hct responded to
   supportive therapy with blood & factors but complicated by comorbid
   ESLD coagulopathy and possible superimposed DIC (although labs could be
   attributed to ESLD and no clear precipitant for DIC).  Pt seen by
   Heme-Onc and Lupus anticcoagulant not felt to be responsible for
   bleeding as it is prothrombotic.
   -monitor Hct q8 today then broaden interval to q12h if stable x 24 hrs
   -active T&S, transfuse for Hct < 21%, <25% if active rebleeding
   -guaiac stools
   -support with FFP and cryo for acute bleeding
   #Coagulopathy: ESLD + lupus anticoagulant positive; has required ddavp
   & amicar in the past; s/p topical thrombin for abdominal wall site
   - coags q8h until clearly stabilized
   - FFP for INR > 2, cryo for fibrinogen < 100
   - DDAVP given in past, repeat PRN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Bleeding
   24 Hour Events:
   [**10-28**]
   - HCT dropped from 23 to 20.5.  Transfused 1 u PRBC and 1 u cryo.  HCT
   bumped to 22.3.
   - Heme clarified the the factor inhibitor on the screen is lupus
   anticoagulant, which should not be associated with bleeding.  Bleeding
   is felt to be due to liver-related factor deficiencies and chronic
   DIC.  Recommended cryo, FFP.  Would avoid Amicar.
   - Liver reported that they are still evaluating him for transplant.
   This will mainly depend on if he has enough social support.  If he
   does, then Liver will discuss with Transplant Surgery.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 63-year-old male with ETOH cirrhosis, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, and coagulopathy. He has a lengthy hospital course with multiple complications, including colonic pseudoobstruction, traumatic foley placement, bleeding from paracentesis site, and chest wall hematoma. He has been transferred back to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring due to acute blood loss anemia.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Re-bleeding:** The patient's Hct level has stabilized, but he is still at risk for re-bleeding due to his coagulopathy and ongoing liver disease.
2. **DIC:** The patient has a history of coagulopathy and has received blood products, which may have triggered a disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) episode.
3. **UTI:** The patient has a positive U/A and dysuria, which may indicate a urinary tract infection (UTI). Empiric ampicillin therapy has been initiated, but further evaluation and treatment are needed.
4. **Foley catheter complications:** The patient continues to ooze from the urethra around the foley catheter, which may lead to further bleeding or infection.
5. **Colonic pseudoobstruction:** The patient's colonic pseudoobstruction has not resolved, and further evaluation and treatment are needed to prevent complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
6. **Acute renal failure:** The patient has acute renal failure, which may be due to hepatic renal syndrome (HRS). Further evaluation and treatment are needed to prevent further kidney damage.
7. **Liver disease progression:** The patient's liver disease is likely to progress, which may lead to further complications such as encephalopathy, ascites, and bleeding.
8. **Infection:** The patient has a history of sepsis and has received broad-spectrum antibiotics, which may increase the risk of antibiotic-resistant infections.
9. **Nutritional deficiencies:** The patient's nutritional status is compromised due to his liver disease and ongoing bleeding, which may lead to malnutrition and further complications.

**Plan:**

1. Monitor the patient's Hct level q8h and broaden the interval to q12h if stable for 24 hours.
2. Continue supportive therapy with blood and factors as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's coagulopathy and bleeding status closely.
4. Evaluate and treat the patient's UTI and foley catheter complications.
5. Continue treatment for colonic pseudoobstruction and acute renal failure.
6. Monitor the patient's liver disease progression and adjust treatment as needed.
7. Evaluate and treat any potential infections.
8. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust treatment as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   63M with ETOH cirrhosis complicated by hepatic encephalopathy,
   esophageal varices, and coagulopathy with lengthy hospital course for
   colonic pseudoobstruction s/p endoscopic decompression, traumatic foley
   placement, bleeding from paracentesis site, and chest wall hematoma
   status post embolization x2, transferred back to ICU for hemodynamic
   monitoring in the setting of acute blood loss anemia.
   #Acute blood loss anemia
 Hct stabilized; multiple sources with
   reexpansion of chest wall hematoma, GU bleeding (less likely GI given
   brown BM with negative guaiac); presently hemostatic, Hct responded to
   supportive therapy with blood & factors but complicated by comorbid
   ESLD coagulopathy and possible superimposed DIC (although labs could be
   attributed to ESLD and no clear precipitant for DIC).  Pt seen by
   Heme-Onc and Lupus anticcoagulant not felt to be responsible for
   bleeding as it is prothrombotic.
   -monitor Hct q8 today then broaden interval to q12h if stable x 24 hrs
   -active T&S, transfuse for Hct < 21%, <25% if active rebleeding
   -guaiac stools
   -support with FFP and cryo for acute bleeding
   #Coagulopathy: ESLD + lupus anticoagulant positive; has required ddavp
   & amicar in the past; s/p topical thrombin for abdominal wall site
   - coags q8h until clearly stabilized
   - FFP for INR > 2, cryo for fibrinogen < 100
   - DDAVP given in past, repeat PRN
   - could also consider activated clotting factors if bleeding out of
   control
   #UTI

   10-100K amp-[**Last Name (un) 206**] enterococcus
   -empiric ampicilliin (cipro on board for sbp ppx) day [**3-15**]
   - UCx - no growth final, will d/c ampicillin
   # Traumatic foley placement: Pt continues to ooze from urethra around
   catheter. Per urology, foley should be continued for at least one week
   - appreciate urology involvement
   - eval/treatment as above
   - bladder irrigation if clots in foley bag
   - urology following
   # Colonic pseudoobstruction: failed rectal tube, did not tolerate NG
   tube, s/p endoscopic decompression [**10-6**]
   - weekly KUB read looking for (pseudo)obstruction q Monday
   # ESLD
 no e/o florid encephalopathy
   -appreciate liver recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Bleeding
   24 Hour Events:
   [**10-28**]
   - HCT dropped from 23 to 20.5.  Transfused 1 u PRBC and 1 u cryo.  HCT
   bumped to 22.3.
   - Heme clarified the the factor inhibitor on the screen is lupus
   anticoagulant, which should not be associated with bleeding.  Bleeding
   is felt to be due to liver-related factor deficiencies and chronic
   DIC.  Recommended cryo, FFP.  Would avoid Amicar.
   - Liver reported that they are still evaluating him for transplant.
   This will mainly depend on if he has enough social support.  If he
   does, then Liver will discuss with Transplant Surgery.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with ETOH cirrhosis, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, and coagulopathy. He has had a lengthy hospital course, including colonic pseudoobstruction, traumatic foley placement, bleeding from paracentesis site, and chest wall hematoma. The patient was transferred back to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring in the setting of acute blood loss anemia.

The patient's current condition includes:

* HCT stabilized at 22.3%
* Coagulopathy with INR 2.0, fibrinogen 168 mg/dL, and platelet count 69 K/uL
* Positive U/A and dysuria, with a UTI caused by Enterococcus
* Traumatic foley placement with ongoing bleeding from urethra around catheter
* Colonic pseudoobstruction with failed rectal tube and endoscopic decompression
* ESLD with no evidence of florid encephalopathy
* Acute renal failure likely caused by HRS
* Malnutrition with TPN and regular diet
* Bleeding due to liver-related factor deficiencies and chronic DIC

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Continued bleeding from urethra around catheter, which can lead to further complications such as sepsis and organ failure.
2. Development of further coagulopathy, which can increase the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage.
3. Progression of colonic pseudoobstruction, which can lead to bowel obstruction, perforation, and sepsis.
4. Worsening of acute renal failure, which can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
5. Development of further infections, such as sepsis and UTI, which can lead to organ failure and death.
6. Hemodynamic instability, which can lead to further complications such as cardiac arrest and death.
7. Potential for further liver damage and decompensation, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should be closely monitored and managed by a multidisciplinary team, including intensivists, hepatologists, urologists, and other specialists as needed. The patient's condition should be reassessed regularly, and adjustments made to his treatment plan as necessary to prevent further complications and optimize his outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   63M with ETOH cirrhosis complicated by hepatic encephalopathy,
   esophageal varices, and coagulopathy with lengthy hospital course for
   colonic pseudoobstruction s/p endoscopic decompression, traumatic foley
   placement, bleeding from paracentesis site, and chest wall hematoma
   status post embolization x2, transferred back to ICU for hemodynamic
   monitoring in the setting of acute blood loss anemia.
   #Acute blood loss anemia
 Hct stabilized; multiple sources with
   reexpansion of chest wall hematoma, GU bleeding (less likely GI given
   brown BM with negative guaiac); presently hemostatic, Hct responded to
   supportive therapy with blood & factors but complicated by comorbid
   ESLD coagulopathy and possible superimposed DIC (although labs could be
   attributed to ESLD and no clear precipitant for DIC).  Pt seen by
   Heme-Onc and Lupus anticcoagulant not felt to be responsible for
   bleeding as it is prothrombotic.
   -monitor Hct q8 today then broaden interval to q12h if stable x 24 hrs
   -active T&S, transfuse for Hct < 21%, <25% if active rebleeding
   -guaiac stools
   -support with FFP and cryo for acute bleeding
   #Coagulopathy: ESLD + lupus anticoagulant positive; has required ddavp
   & amicar in the past; s/p topical thrombin for abdominal wall site
   - coags q8h until clearly stabilized
   - FFP for INR > 2, cryo for fibrinogen < 100
   - DDAVP given in past, repeat PRN
   - could also consider activated clotting factors if bleeding out of
   control

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   63M with ETOH cirrhosis complicated by hepatic encephalopathy,
   esophageal varices, and coagulopathy with lengthy hospital course for
   colonic pseudoobstruction s/p endoscopic decompression, traumatic foley
   placement, bleeding from paracentesis site, and chest wall hematoma
   status post embolization x2, transferred back to ICU for hemodynamic
   monitoring in the setting of acute blood loss anemia.
   #Acute blood loss anemia
 Hct stabilized; multiple sources with
   reexpansion of chest wall hematoma, GU bleeding (less likely GI given
   brown BM with negative guaiac); presently hemostatic, Hct responded to
   supportive therapy with blood & factors but complicated by comorbid
   ESLD coagulopathy and possible superimposed DIC (although labs could be
   attributed to ESLD and no clear precipitant for DIC).  Pt seen by
   Heme-Onc and Lupus anticcoagulant not felt to be responsible for
   bleeding as it is prothrombotic.
   -monitor Hct q8 today then broaden interval to q12h if stable x 24 hrs
   -active T&S, transfuse for Hct < 21%, <25% if active rebleeding
   -guaiac stools
   -support with FFP and cryo for acute bleeding
   #Coagulopathy: ESLD + lupus anticoagulant positive; has required ddavp
   & amicar in the past; s/p topical thrombin for abdominal wall site
   - coags q8h until clearly stabilized
   - FFP for INR > 2, cryo for fibrinogen < 100
   - DDAVP given in past, repeat PRN
   - could also consider activated clotting factors if bleeding out of
   control
   #UTI
 positive U/A and dysuria (v. traumtized urethra), [**10-12**] UCx with
   10-100K amp-[**Last Name (un) 206**] enterococcus
   -empiric ampicilliin (cipro on board for sbp ppx) day [**3-15**]
   - UCx - no growth final, will d/c ampicillin
   # Traumatic foley placement: Pt continues to ooze from urethra around
   catheter. Per urology, foley should be continued for at least one week
   -appreciate urology involvement
   -eval/treatment as above
   - bladder irrigation if clots in foley bag
   -urology following
   # Colonic pseudoobstruction: failed rectal tube, did not tolerate NG
   tube, s/p endoscopic decompression [**10-6**]
   -weekly KUB read looking for (pseudo)obstruction q Monday
   # ESLD
 no e/o florid encephalopathy
   -appreciate liver recs
   -cipro for sbp ppx
   -hold lactulose given diarrhea
   -discuss goals of care with patient & family given ongoing ETOH use
   prior to admission
   # Acute renal failure: likely 2/2 HRS
   - continue midodrine, octreotide
   - appreciate renal recs
   # FEN: replete lytes prn / TPN and regular diet
   # PPX: H2blocker
   # ACCESS: 18g, 22 g; L-sided PICC
   # CODE: FULL (confirmed); will likely benefit from goals of care
   discussion, as above

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a lengthy hospital course due to ETOH cirrhosis complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, and coagulopathy. The patient has been experiencing bleeding from various sources, including the paracentesis site, GU bleeding, and chest wall hematoma.

The patient's current condition is:

* Hemodynamically stable with a heart rate of 68 beats per minute and blood pressure of 121/62 mmHg
* Respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 100%
* Temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F)
* Wt: 93 kg (admission weight: 89.7 kg)
* Height: 72 inches
* Hct: 22.3% (previously dropped to 20.5% due to bleeding)
* Platelets: 69,000/mL (previously dropped to 66,000/mL due to bleeding)
* INR: 2.0 (previously elevated due to coagulopathy)
* Fibrinogen: 168 mg/dL (previously low due to coagulopathy)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 6.8-7.4 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 24.9-22.3%
* Plt: 71-81 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 2.0-2.3 mg/dL
* Glucose: 124 mg/dL
* ALT: 14 IU/L
* AST: 30 IU/L
* Alk Phos: 59 IU/L
* T Bili: 7.6 mg/dL
* Fibrinogen: 168 mg/dL
* LDH: 334 IU/L
* Ca++: 9.8 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.7 mg/dL

The patient's medical complications include:

* Acute blood loss anemia
* Coagulopathy due to ESLD and possible superimposed DIC
* Traumatic foley placement with ongoing bleeding
* Colonic pseudoobstruction
* Acute renal failure likely due to HRS
* ESLD with no evidence of florid encephalopathy

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitoring of Hct q8h and broadening the interval to q12h if stable for 24 hours
* Active transfusion for Hct < 21% or <25% if active rebleeding
* Support with FFP and cryo for acute bleeding
* Coags q8h until clearly stabilized
* FFP for INR > 2 and cryo for fibrinogen < 100
* DDAVP given in the past, repeat PRN
* Consideration of activated clotting factors if bleeding is out of control
* Empiric ampicillin for UTI
* Foley catheter to be continued for at least one week
* Weekly KUB read looking for pseudoobstruction
* Hold lactulose due to diarrhea
* Discussion of goals of care with patient and family given ongoing ETOH use prior to admission
* Continue midodrine and octreotide for acute renal failure
* Replete lytes PRN and TPN and regular diet
* H2 blocker for prophylaxis

The patient's disposition is planned to be transferred to the floor once stable."
