   presents from surgical floor for persistent hypotension. Patient
   underwent planned procedure on [**2176-8-30**] that was without complication.
   Patient received minimal intra-operative fluid [**1-20**] planned bowel
   reanastamosis and desire to avoid bowel intraoperatively. Post-op
   patient received 4L LR, 2u PRBCs and remained hypotensive on the floor
   overnight.

   On the am of transfer, patient was continuing to be hypotensive despite
   IVF resuscitation and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for closer
   monitoring. HCT stable.  Pt was put on cefazolin and flagyl.
   .
   On arrival to the floor, pt persistently hypotensive with SBP in 80s,
   tachycardiac to 110-120.  WBC count 13.1 with a left shift.  EKG showed
   sinus tachycardia but otherwise unchanged from baseline.
   .
   ROS: + nausea, [**1-28**] RLQ pain. The patient denies any fevers, chills,
   vomiting, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea,
   PND, lower extremity oedema, cough, urinary frequency, urgency,

   MEDICAL ATTENDING ADMIT ADDENDUM
   I examined the patient and reiviewed his history and pertinent labs.  I
   was physically present with the MICU team during the key portions of
   the services provided. I agree with the note above, including the
   assessment and plan. I would emphasize and add the following:
   The patient has expected post op pain,  clearly improved with PCA, and
   has little other complaints.  His normal SBP is 110.
   On exam: His SBP is in the 80s and HR in the 120s, though he looks very
   comfortable other than his abdomen. Lungs clear.  Cor- RRR but tachy;
   Ext- no edema; Neuro
 a&o GU- scant urine in Foley; Abd
 as above
   thin brownish fluid saturating the gauze dressing of one of his wounds
   Lab: as above.  CxR
 clear except for +/- LLL atelectasis
   \
   Problems:
   1.       S/p ex lap and take down of entero cutaneous fistulae with
   ileostomy
   2.       Post op hypotension, tachycardia, and oliguria
 abdominal
   sepsis vs volume depletion from gut third space losses vs both
   3.       Hx of multiple cancers ( GB, appendix, gastric, colon)
   Plan:
   1.       Aggressive IV fluids, aiming for UO> 30cc/hr and SBP>90
   2.       Agree with A line
   3.       Agree with change in antibiotics to Zosyn and Vanco
   4.       [**Month (only) 51**] need central line , but for now his SCL portacath and 16 g
   PIV are sufficing for IVF
   5.       Appreciate surgery following his wound closely, esp what they
   believe is a seroma draining
   6.       Recheck CXR if any  increased SOB
   7.       Consider serum cortisol if BP doesn
t respond to 4-6 L of
   fluids

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Septic shock: The patient's rising WBC count, tachycardia, and hypotension suggest septic shock, possibly due to an anastamotic leak, surgical site infection, or line infection.
2. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's hypotension and oliguria may be due to hypovolemic shock, potentially caused by fluid loss from the gut or third-space losses.
3. Anastamotic leak: The patient's abdominal pain, nausea, and rising WBC count suggest the possibility of an anastamotic leak.
4. Surgical site infection: The patient's abdominal pain, tenderness, and erythema around the former fistula site may indicate a surgical site infection.
5. Line infection: The patient's hypotension and rising WBC count may be related to a line infection.
6. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium level is 1.3 mg/dL, which is below the normal range, potentially leading to hypocalcemia-related complications.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is 104 mg/dL, which may indicate hyperglycemia, potentially leading to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and low oxygen saturation may indicate respiratory failure, potentially caused by pneumonia, atelectasis, or other respiratory complications.
9. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may indicate cardiovascular instability, potentially leading to cardiac arrest or other cardiovascular complications.
10. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting may indicate gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or bleeding.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to address these potential complications. The plan includes aggressive IV fluids, antibiotics, and surgical intervention to relook at the anastamosis. The patient's blood sugar, calcium, and other laboratory values should be closely monitored, and adjustments made as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of colon cancer who underwent a right colectomy and fistula takedown on [**2176-8-30**]. He was transferred to the ICU from the surgical floor due to persistent hypotension despite IV fluid resuscitation. He is tachycardic and hypotensive, with a rising WBC count, which is concerning for septic or hypovolemic shock. His hematocrit is stable, ruling out hemorrhagic shock. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and IV fluids to goal UOP 30 cc/hr, SBP >90, and MAP >65.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's rising WBC count and tachycardia suggest a possible septic etiology, which could lead to septic shock if not treated promptly.
2. Anastomotic Leak: The patient's history of colon cancer and fistula takedown increases the risk of anastomotic leak, which could lead to peritonitis and sepsis.
3. Surgical Site Infection: The patient's history of surgical site infection and fistula takedown increases the risk of surgical site infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
4. Line Infection: The patient's presence of central lines and peripheral IV lines increases the risk of line infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
5. Hypovolemic Shock: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia could be due to hypovolemic shock, which could be caused by blood loss, dehydration, or other factors.
6. Organ Failure: The patient's underlying medical conditions, such as colon cancer and fistula takedown, increase the risk of organ failure, particularly renal and respiratory failure.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia suggest a possible respiratory failure, which could be caused by pneumonia, atelectasis, or other factors.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Trend serial lactates to assess for septic shock.
3. Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics and IV fluids to goal UOP 30 cc/hr, SBP >90, and MAP >65.
4. Consider repeat imaging for anastomotic leak in the setting of rising WBC count and hypotension.
5. Place an arterial line to monitor the patient's blood pressure and hemodynamics.
6. Consider transfusing the patient for Hct > 30.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's WBC count, fever curve, and other laboratory results.
8. Consider surgical intervention to relook at the anastomosis and address any possible anastomotic leak or surgical site infection.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider mechanical ventilation if necessary."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I have examined the patient and reviewed his history and relevant labs.
   I was physically present with the MICU team for the key portions of the
   services provided and I agree with the above note, including its
   assessment and plan. I would add and emphasize the following:
   Over the past 24 hrs the pt required levophed as 6 L of fluid did not
   result in sustained improvement in U.O or BP.  On Levophed these both
   improved.  Patient still has abd pain, but no other complaints.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I have examined the patient and reviewed his history and relevant labs.
   I was physically present with the MICU team for the key portions of the
   services provided and I agree with the above note, including its
   assessment and plan. I would add and emphasize the following:
   Over the past 24 hrs the pt required levophed as 6 L of fluid did not
   result in sustained improvement in U.O or BP.  On Levophed these both
   improved.  Patient still has abd pain, but no other complaints.
   Remains on Zosyn and Vanco
   On exam: afeb, BP= 106/75,  Sat=96% on 2L  I/O = + 6L over 24 hrs.  U.O

   1.       Post enterocutaneous fistula takedown hypotension, likely
   either to third spacing into abdomen, some bleeding into abdomen,
   and/or abdominal sepsis
   2.       Renal insuff due to decreased BP

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's increasing white blood cell count (WBC) and persistent hypotension suggest a potential infection, which may lead to sepsis.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased from 0.8 to 1.4, indicating potential kidney damage. The patient's hypotension and oliguria (decreased urine output) may contribute to ARF.
3. Anastomotic Leak: The patient's abdominal tenderness and rising WBC count may indicate an anastomotic leak, which can lead to further complications.
4. Hypovolemic Shock: The patient's persistent hypotension and oliguria suggest hypovolemic shock, which may be due to blood loss, third spacing of fluids, or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
5. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's bronchial breath sounds at the right base and possible pneumonia may lead to respiratory failure.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's abdominal tenderness, nausea, and vomiting may indicate gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
7. Anemia: The patient's decreasing hematocrit (Hct) level may indicate blood loss or dilution, which can lead to anemia.
8. Hypocalcemia: The patient's low calcium level may contribute to muscle weakness, cramping, or cardiac arrhythmias.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuing fluid boluses and pressors to manage hypotension.
2. Monitoring for signs of sepsis and adjusting antibiotic therapy accordingly.
3. Following up on blood cultures, temperature curve, and WBC count to monitor for infection.
4. Trending creatinine levels to monitor for renal function.
5. Adjusting pain management to ensure adequate pain control.
6. Monitoring for signs of anastomotic leak and considering repeat imaging.
7. Weaning levophed and increasing PCA for pain management.
8. Transfusing blood products as needed to manage anemia and hypovolemic shock.
9. Following up on lab results, including electrolyte levels, to monitor for potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of colon cancer, who underwent resection of anastomosis and fistula takedown. He is currently in the ICU due to post-operative hypotension, increased WBC, acute renal failure, and pressor requirement. He has a persistent drain output from an abscess fistula and is receiving antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 106/75 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is receiving fluids and pressors to maintain his blood pressure.

The patient's laboratory results show an increase in WBC, creatinine, and lactate levels, indicating possible sepsis or acute kidney injury. His electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hypokalemia and hypocalcemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's increasing WBC and lactate levels suggest possible sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level has increased, indicating possible AKI, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and cardiovascular complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still unstable, and he may require continued pressor support to maintain perfusion.
4. Anastomotic Leak: Although the patient's abdomen is tender, the wounds look clear, and anastomotic leak is not likely, it is still a possible complication that needs to be monitored.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory support is limited, and he may require further intervention if his oxygenation and ventilation deteriorate.
6. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent further complications.
7. Infection: The patient's increased WBC and lactate levels suggest possible infection, which needs to be treated promptly to prevent sepsis.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after undergoing fistula resection. The patient's chief complaint is hypotension, and he has been experiencing increased white blood cell count.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/75 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 9 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 96%.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a MAP of 60, which has required multiple fluid boluses and pressors to maintain. He has been receiving norepinephrine infusion at 0.03 mcg/kg/min.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.1 K/μL, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 120 K/μL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 5.4 mmol/L.

The patient's physical examination is notable for his anxious appearance, pale conjunctiva, and tender abdomen. He has no acute distress, and his respiratory and cardiovascular examinations are normal.

The patient's laboratory results also show an increased lactate level of 2.1 mmol/L, which may indicate a metabolic acidosis. His calcium level is slightly elevated at 7.8 mg/dL, and his magnesium level is normal at 2.2 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's increased white blood cell count and lactate level may indicate the presence of an underlying infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to his underlying medical condition or the anesthesia used during his surgery.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is positive, which may lead to fluid overload and subsequent complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, which may indicate early signs of respiratory failure.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's elevated lactate level may indicate a metabolic acidosis, which may require further evaluation and management.
6. Infection: The patient's indwelling lines and drains may increase his risk of developing an infection.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization may increase his risk of developing a DVT.

In conclusion, the patient is a 24-year-old male who is at risk for various medical complications due to his underlying condition and the anesthesia used during his surgery. Close monitoring and management of his vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination are essential to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Temperature: 36.2°C (97.2°F)
* Heart rate: 97 bpm (within normal range)
* Blood pressure: 106/75 mmHg (normotensive)
* Respiratory rate: 9 breaths per minute (within normal range)
* SpO2: 96% (normal)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 13.1 x 10^9/L (within normal range)
* Hematocrit: 30.9% (stable overnight)
* Platelet count: 120 x 10^9/L (within normal range)
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL (within normal range)
* Blood glucose: 104 mg/dL (within normal range)
* Lactic acid: 2.1 mmol/L (within normal range)

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Well-nourished, no acute distress, overweight/obese, anxious
* Eyes/conjunctiva: PERRL, conjunctiva pale
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds
* Respiratory: Symmetric chest expansion, resonant percussion, clear breath sounds
* Abdomen: Soft, distended, obese, no bowel sounds, very tender, wounds look clear
* Extremities: Right and left radial pulses present, no edema
* Skin: Warm
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented x3, movement purposeful, tone normal

The patient's plan includes:

* Trending serial lactates
* IV fluids to goal UOP 30 cc/hr, SBP >90, MAP >65
* Transfusing for Hct > 30
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics, switching to vancomycin and Zosyn
* Following up blood and urine cultures
* Trending WBC count and fever curve
* Surgery to relook at anastomosis
* Placing an arterial line

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Septic shock due to anastomotic leak or surgical site infection
* Hypovolemic shock due to fluid loss or hemorrhage
* Hypotension due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiac dysfunction
* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or pulmonary embolism
* Renal failure due to hypotension, sepsis, or pre-existing kidney disease
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to anastomotic leak or surgical site infection
* Wound infection or dehiscence due to poor wound care or surgical site infection
* Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility or underlying thrombotic risk factors
* Stress ulcer bleeding due to sepsis, hypotension, or steroid therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male who underwent a colectomy and fistula takedown three days ago. He has been experiencing post-operative hypotension, acute renal failure, and pressor requirement. His abdominal exam has improved, and his wounds appear clean. A wound culture grew [**Last Name (LF) 1685**], and linezolid has been added to his antibiotic regimen. He has been afebrile and his WBC is trending down.

The patient has been experiencing acute renal failure, which is likely due to hypotension during surgery. His creatinine has improved with fluid resuscitation, and he is most likely in oliguric acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He continues to have borderline urine output and requires close monitoring of his blood pressure and volume status.

The patient's colon cancer status post-colectomy and fistula takedown is stable, and he will be discussed with surgery regarding transfer to the floor today. He is receiving dilaudid PCA for post-operative pain control and will remain NPO until bowel functioning returns.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's wound culture grew [**Last Name (LF) 1685**], and he has been experiencing post-operative hypotension, which increases his risk of developing sepsis.
2. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to hypotension during surgery, and he is at risk of developing ATN, which can lead to chronic kidney disease.
3. Oliguria: The patient's urine output is borderline, and he requires close monitoring to ensure adequate perfusion and prevent acute kidney injury.
4. GI Bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeding and is at risk of experiencing further bleeding, particularly in the setting of antibiotic therapy.
5. Wound Infection: The patient's wound culture grew [**Last Name (LF) 1685**], and he is at risk of developing a wound infection, which can lead to sepsis and other complications.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk of developing respiratory failure, particularly in the setting of sepsis and acute kidney injury.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of colon cancer and surgery increases his risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias and heart failure."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple comorbidities. The patient has received multiple fluid boluses to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60, with pressors initially being used and subsequently discontinued. The patient has received a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to correct anemia, with a current hemoglobin (Hct) level of 26%.

The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) is resolving, with a current creatinine (Cr) level of 1.0 mg/dL. The patient has received a range of medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and acid reducers.

Physically, the patient is stable, with a temperature of 98.1°F (36.7°C), a heart rate of 95 beats per minute (bpm), and a blood pressure of 84/64 mmHg. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen, but not on mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC) range: 11.0-16.1 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hct) level: 26.1%
* Platelet count (Plt): 82 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr) level: 1.0 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level: 25 mEq/L
* Serum glucose level: 92 mg/dL
* Other lab results: PT/PTT/INR: 17.8/39.8/1.6, differential: 89.2% neutrophils, 5.4% lymphocytes, 4.3% monocytes, 0.9% eosinophils, lactic acid: 2.1 mmol/L, LDH: 158 IU/L, calcium: 7.7 mg/dL, magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL, phosphorus: 2.0 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: Given the patient's history of GI bleeding, AKI, and antibiotic administration, there is a risk of sepsis.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen requirements and ABG results suggest that they may be at risk for respiratory failure.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of hypertension and the use of pressors may increase their risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GI bleeding and the use of anticoagulants and acid reducers may increase their risk of further bleeding.
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and the use of anticoagulants may increase their risk of DVT.
* Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness and the use of corticosteroids may increase their risk of stress ulcer.
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's use of mechanical ventilation and the presence of a central line may increase their risk of VAP.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and the potential complications that can arise, close monitoring and prompt intervention are necessary to prevent and manage any complications that may develop."

   .
   Plan:
   # Post-operative Hypotension- Patient with increasing WBC, acute renal
   failure and pressor requirement s/p major GI surgery. Concern for SIRS
   after surgery and/or sepsis. Patient with very tender abdomen, that has
   not been worsening, so anastomotic leak is not that likely. Wounds look
   clear. Patient seems euvolemic for now and with low O2 requirements,
   currently on antibiotics.
   -          Continue fluid boluses PRN
   -          Continue Vanc/Zosyn (Day 2)
   -          Follow up blood cultures
   -          Follow up temp curve
   -          Follow up WBC
   -          Touch-base with surgery
   -          Transuse 1 RBC unit
   -          PM lytes and PM HCT
   #ARF: Patient with new acute renal failure (creatinine increase >0.5).
   Most likely due to hypotension during surgery. Patient most likely on
   oliguic ATN, but volume needs to be monitored as well as BP to make
   sure perfusion is adequate.
   -          F/u urine lytes
   -          F/u UA looking for granular casts
   -          Trend creatinine
   -          F/u UOP
   .
   # Colon CA s/p colectomy and fistula takedown: POD#1
   - dilaudid PCA for post-operative pain control. Increase pain control.
   - keep NPO until bowel functioning
   - consider repeat imaging for anastamotic leak in setting of rising WBC
   and hypotension
   .
   # FEN: NPO until bowels start to move, monitor and replete lytes
   .
   # Access: right Port, PIV x1 16g, 20g
   .
   # PPx: hep sc BID, PPI, pneumoboots.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of colon cancer and recent surgery (colectomy and fistula takedown). He is currently in the ICU due to post-operative hypotension, acute renal failure, and pressor requirements. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 84/64 mmHg, heart rate of 95 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He has received multiple fluid boluses and has been given albumin, with pressors being discontinued this morning. He has also received blood products, including 1 unit of packed red blood cells.

The patient's laboratory results show acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, and a white blood cell count of 13.1 x 10^9/L. His electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L and a phosphorus level of 2.0 mg/dL.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is at risk for sepsis and SIRS due to his recent surgery and persistent drain output from an abscess fistula. He is also at risk for anastomotic leak and bowel obstruction. The plan is to continue fluid boluses as needed, antibiotics, and to follow up with blood cultures, temperature curve, and white blood cell count. The patient will also receive a unit of packed red blood cells and will have his electrolytes and hemoglobin checked regularly.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's recent surgery and persistent drain output from an abscess fistula put him at risk for sepsis and SIRS.
2. Anastomotic leak: The patient's history of colon cancer and recent surgery make him at risk for anastomotic leak.
3. Bowel obstruction: The patient's recent surgery and persistent drain output from an abscess fistula put him at risk for bowel obstruction.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure and ongoing fluid resuscitation put him at risk for further kidney injury.
5. Hypotension: The patient's ongoing hypotension and pressor requirements put him at risk for further hypotension and potential cardiovascular complications.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal, which may lead to further complications if not managed properly.
7. Infection: The patient's recent surgery and persistent drain output from an abscess fistula put him at risk for infection.
8. Organ failure: The patient's ongoing acute renal failure and potential for further organ dysfunction put him at risk for multi-organ failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 64 year-old male with a history of colon ca s/p R colectomy
   ([**2174**]) c/b persistent drain output from [**Last Name (un) **]-abscess fistula, s/p
   Ex-lap, fistula takedown, resection of anastamosis [**2176-8-30**] . POD #3.
   .
   Plan:
   # Post-operative Hypotension- Patient with increasing WBC, acute renal
   failure and pressor requirement s/p GI surgery. Concern for sepsis
   post-procedure. Patients abdominal exam has improved, wounds appear
   clean and WBC is trending down. He has also been afebrile. Abdominal
   wound cx grew enterococcus, otherwise all other cultures are negative
   to date.
   -          Continue fluid boluses PRN for hypotension.
   -          Continue Vanc/Zosyn (Day 3)
   -          Follow up blood cultures
   -          Monitor fever curve, WBC and hct.
   -          Follow surgery recs, likely transfer to floor today
   #ARF: Most likely due to hypotension during surgery. His creatinine has
   improved with fluid rescusitation, now close to or at baseline. Patient
   most likely in oliguic ATN (given FeNa >0.3 showing prerenal etiology),
   but volume needs to be monitored as well as BP to make sure perfusion
   is adequate. Continues to have borderline UOP.
   - F/u UA looking for granular casts
   -          Monitor BUN, Cr and UOP
   -          Bolus prn to maintain UOP>30cc/hr
   .
   # Colon CA s/p colectomy and fistula takedown: POD#3. Will discuss with
   surgery If patient is stable enough to transfer to floor today.
   - dilaudid PCA for post-operative pain control.
   - keep NPO until bowel functioning
   - WBC and fever curve trend
   .
   # FEN: NPO until bowels start to move, monitor and replete lytes

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of colon cancer and a recent colectomy. He has been admitted to the ICU with multiple fluid boluses for hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and sepsis. The patient has received antibiotics, pressors, and albumin, and has had a recent abdominal wound culture that grew Enterococcus.

The patient's current vital signs include:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
* Heart rate: 95 bpm
* Blood pressure: 84/64 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 11 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 13.1-11.0 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 30.9-26.1%
* Platelet count: 120-82 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.3-0.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 104-92 mg/dL

The patient's medical complications include:

* ARF, likely due to hypotension during surgery
* Sepsis, possibly related to the abdominal wound infection
* Oliguric acute tubular necrosis (ATN), as indicated by the high FeNa value
* Borderline urine output

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing fluid boluses for hypotension
* Continuing antibiotics and monitoring blood cultures
* Monitoring fever curve, WBC, and hematocrit
* Following up with surgery to discuss transfer to the floor
* Monitoring BUN, creatinine, and urine output
* Bolusing PRN to maintain urine output >30cc/hr

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further deterioration of ARF
* Development of septic shock
* Progression of ATN
* Delayed recovery of bowel function
* Wound infection or dehiscence
* Development of respiratory failure
* Hemodynamic instability

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure the patient's safe transfer to the floor."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with sepsis and acute renal failure following a surgical procedure for a colon cancer-related fistula. He has been receiving pressors for hemodynamic support, but they were discontinued 24 hours ago. He is currently receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, and has improved hemodynamics. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, and blood pressure of 121/69 mmHg. He is receiving respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen and has a SpO2 of 96%.

The patient has a history of allergies to aspirin, morphine, and GI bleeding. He is also taking pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis and heparin for DVT prophylaxis.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate levels. His creatinine level has improved, and his urine output has increased.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's sepsis has been deemed transient and has not evolved into sustained SIRS. He is expected to be transferred to the surgical floor once he is stable. The plan is to continue vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, and to discuss the addition of linezolid for preliminary findings of VRE on culture. The patient's acute renal failure has improved and is likely related to a pre-renal insult. He will be monitored for urine output and pain control will be managed with PCA.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis has been deemed transient, but it is essential to monitor for any signs of deterioration.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure has improved, but it is crucial to monitor his urine output and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
3. VRE: The patient's preliminary culture results show VRE, which may require changes to his antibiotic regimen.
4. Colon Cancer: The patient's colon cancer may require ongoing management and follow-up with his primary care team.
5. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to his immobility and underlying medical conditions. Prophylactic heparin will be continued to reduce this risk.
6. Stress Ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to his critical illness and will continue to receive pantoprazole for prophylaxis.
7. VAP: The patient is at risk for VAP due to his intubation and will require close monitoring for any signs of infection.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, and he is expected to be transferred to the surgical floor once he is stable. However, it is essential to monitor for any signs of deterioration and adjust his management plan accordingly."
