You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with hypotension and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has been treated with antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Tobramycin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 78 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 93/52 mmHg. The patient is receiving phenylephrine infusion to maintain blood pressure.

The patient has impaired skin integrity, hypovolemia, and septic shock. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and line management. The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock and hypotension indicate a high risk of sepsis progression, which can lead to organ failure, including respiratory, cardiac, and renal failure.
2. Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine levels (1.4-1.5 mg/dL) suggest possible kidney injury, which can worsen with continued sepsis and hypotension.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute and partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 25 mmHg indicate a risk of respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by sepsis and hypotension.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's heart rhythm is ventricular-paced, indicating a potential risk of cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's impaired skin integrity and septic shock increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, ileus, or perforation.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and potential kidney injury increase the risk of renal failure, which can worsen with continued sepsis and hypotension.
7. Infection Progression: The patient's UTI and septic shock indicate a high risk of infection progression, which can lead to further organ failure and mortality."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: I suspect hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very
   poor intake since returning to NH per family. However, presence of
   leukocytosis, low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for
   sepsis. Most likely source would be pulm or urine. He has very psoitive
   U/A. Of note, he has grown numerous unusual organisms from urine in
   recent past
   - gentle IVF as has known CHF
   - continue neo and goal to wean
   - goal MAP>65, CVP 10-12, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn and tailor to cx
   - f/u blood, urine cx
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, lungs sound mostly clear, although he
   is total body volume overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - consider repeat echo

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: I suspect hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very
   poor intake since returning to NH per family. However, presence of
   leukocytosis, low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for
   sepsis. Most likely source would be pulm or urine. He has very psoitive
   U/A. Of note, he has grown numerous unusual organisms from urine in
   recent past
   - gentle IVF as has known CHF
   - continue neo and goal to wean
   - goal MAP>65, CVP 10-12, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn and tailor to cx
   - f/u blood, urine cx
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, lungs sound mostly clear, although he
   is total body volume overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - consider repeat echo
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart tomorrow
   .
   # UTI: Frequent UTI with unusual organsisms. He has large bladder
   divertic and chronic foley
   - treatment as above
   - foley changed in ED
   - followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in urology
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Infection w/u as above. Of note, during last admission,
   he was started empirically on Metronidazole on [**12-15**]; however, C. diff
   negative on [**12-16**]
   - would stop Flagyl as c. diff toxin a and B negative on [**12-16**]
   - f/u blood, urine, stool cx
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Suspect some trop leak from heart failure in
   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - telemetry until ROMI with CE x 3
   - repeat EKG in AM
   .
   # ARF: Baseline 1.2, now 1.5 which is mostly likely prerenal azotemia
   - gentle IVFs overnight
   - check urine lytes to calc FEUrea
   .
   # Hypernatremia: I suspect hypernatremia is from excess free water loss
   from fever, insensible losses.
   - send urine lytes
   - gentle free water replacement (he has a 3.7L deficit)
   - D5W at 75 cc/hr

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications are potential concerns:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis, low-grade fever, and hypotension are concerning for sepsis, particularly given the positive urine culture and the patient's history of frequent UTIs.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's increasing creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest prerenal azotemia, which may worsen if not managed promptly.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels may be due to excess free water loss from fever, insensible losses, and/or decreased sodium clearance.
4. Alkalosis: The patient's elevated pH levels on ABG may be due to contraction alkalosis from insensible losses.
5. Venous Clots: The patient has a non-occlusive thrombus in the left cephalic vein and a history of right DVT, which may require anticoagulation therapy.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's arrhythmia may require management with antiarrhythmic medications and close monitoring.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may require management with antihypertensive medications, particularly given their history of hypertension and the potential for increased blood pressure with pressors.
8. Type 2 Diabetes: The patient's diabetes may require management with insulin and close monitoring of blood glucose levels.
9. Anemia: The patient's anemia may require transfusion and further evaluation to determine the underlying cause.
10. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's pressure ulcers may require wound care and pressure relief measures to prevent further deterioration.
11. Sacral/Buttock Rash: The patient's sacral and buttock rash may require further evaluation and management to determine the underlying cause and prevent further complications.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and improve their clinical outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, MCA CVA, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type II. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and respiratory distress. His current medications include vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and phenylephrine. He has a history of frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) with unusual organisms and has grown numerous unusual organisms from his urine in the past.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, low-grade fever, and hypotension, which is concerning for sepsis. His urine analysis is positive, and he has a large bladder diverticulum and chronic foley catheter. He also has elevated troponin levels, which may be due to acute renal failure and decreased clearance.

The patient has a number of medical complications, including anasarca, hypernatremia, alkalosis, and contraction alkalosis. He also has a non-occlusive thrombus in the left cephalic vein and a history of right deep vein thrombosis with an inferior vena cava filter.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis, low-grade fever, and hypotension are concerning for sepsis. He has a history of frequent UTIs, which may be the source of the infection.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated troponin levels and decreased clearance may indicate acute renal failure.
3. Contraction Alkalosis: The patient's alkalosis may be due to contraction alkalosis from insensible losses.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may be due to excess free water loss from fever and insensible losses.
5. Anasarca: The patient's anasarca may be due to chronic malnutrition and may increase his risk of pressure ulcers.
6. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's anasarca and low albumin levels may increase his risk of developing pressure ulcers.
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis: The patient's history of right deep vein thrombosis and non-occlusive thrombus in the left cephalic vein may increase his risk of developing deep vein thrombosis.
8. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's history of deep vein thrombosis and atrial fibrillation may increase his risk of developing pulmonary embolism.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for UTI and sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and cardiac output closely to ensure that he is not developing septic shock.
3. Consider repeating echocardiogram to assess cardiac function.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy as needed.
5. Consider adjusting his medications to reduce his risk of pressure ulcers and deep vein thrombosis.
6. Monitor the patient's wound care and adjust his treatment plan as needed to prevent pressure ulcers.
7. Consider referring the patient to a nutritionist to assess his nutritional needs and develop a plan to improve his nutrition."

   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: I suspect hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very
   poor intake since returning to NH per family. However, presence of
   leukocytosis, low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for
   sepsis. Most likely source would be urine. He has very psoitive U/A. Of
   note, he has grown numerous unusual organisms from urine in recent past
   - gentle IVF as has known CHF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition and potential medical complications as follows:

Patient's Condition:

* The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure (EF 45%), s/p MCA CVA, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type II.
* He presents with hypotension, respiratory distress, and urinary tract infection (UTI).
* He has a positive urine culture and has grown unusual organisms from urine in the past.
* He has a history of chronic foley catheterization and has a large bladder diverticulum with possible fungus ball.
* He has a stage II pressure ulcer on his left heel and a sacral/buttock rash with healing unstageable ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Sepsis: Given the patient's hypotension, leukocytosis, and low-grade fever, there is a concern for sepsis, particularly urinary tract sepsis.
* Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest prerenal azotemia, which may worsen if not managed properly.
* Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's history of CKD and current ARF may lead to further kidney damage if not managed effectively.
* Heart Failure: The patient's systolic heart failure (EF 45%) may worsen if not managed properly, particularly with the presence of sepsis and ARF.
* Wound Complications: The patient's stage II pressure ulcer and sacral/buttock rash may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as cellulitis, abscesses, or osteomyelitis.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not managed properly, particularly with the presence of chronic kidney disease and heart failure.
* Malnutrition: The patient's low albumin levels and history of malnutrition may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as poor wound healing and increased risk of infections.
* Venous Clots: The patient's history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic vein may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as pulmonary embolism or post-thrombotic syndrome.

Based on the patient's condition and potential medical complications, I recommend the following:

* Continue to manage the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and supportive care.
* Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust fluid management accordingly.
* Manage the patient's heart failure with diuretics and vasodilators as needed.
* Monitor the patient's wound healing and adjust wound care accordingly.
* Manage the patient's anemia with iron and B12 supplementation as needed.
* Monitor the patient's nutrition and adjust diet accordingly.
* Consider the patient's history of DVT and non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic vein and adjust anticoagulation therapy accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very poor intake
   since returning to NH per family. However, presence of leukocytosis,
   low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for sepsis. Most likely
   source would be urine. He has very psoitive U/A. Of note, he has grown
   numerous unusual organisms from urine in recent past
   - continues to be on low dose neo, will try to wean today
   - IVF boluses as needed as he had poor Po intake and respiratory status
   is stable
   - goal MAP>65, CVP 10-12, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn and tobra for UTI coverage
   - f/u blood
 NGTD
   - urine with >100,000 GNR, no speciation yet
   .
   # UTI: Frequent UTI with unusual organsisms. He has large bladder
   divertic with possible fungus ball in bladder and chronic foley
   - treatment as above with triple abx
   - foley changed in ED
   - urology followed, no change in management at this time,do not think
   suprapubic catheter or CBI is warranted
   .
   # Nutrition
 has been NPO since arrival due to aspiration risk, need
   to discuss with family the options for feeding. Long term care would
   likely require a PEG as his albumin is 1.6 and he has such poor ability
   to keep fluid intravascularly.  If not, consider TPN with eating for
   comfort with known risk of aspiration
   - family talk
   .
   # Pain
 seems to be from scrotal edema, although unable to pinpoint
   exact cause
   - low dose morphine for pain control, is much more comfortable and
   talkative today
   - elevate scrotum for comfort
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Infection w/u as above. Of note, during last admission,
   he was started empirically on Metronidazole on [**12-15**]; however, C. diff
   negative on [**12-16**]
   - flagyl d/c
   - likely from UTI
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, intravascularly dry, extravascularly
   overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - oxygen level appropriate on room air despite being positive 6 L
   yesterday
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart if respiratory status changes
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Suspect some trop leak from heart failure in
   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - ruled out bye CEs
   - stable
   .
   # ARF: Baseline 1.2, now 1.4 which is trending downward
 most likely
   prerenal azotemia
   - stable, will continue to follow
   .
   # Hypernatremia: 148 on admission to 143; resolved with free water
   replacement
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Venous clots: He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic
   vein felt to be [**12-20**] PICC line and stable. He also has hx R DVT s/p IVC
   filter
   -supratherapeutic, holding coumadin
   - continuing to rise, will hold and reverse only if bleeding
   - possible FFP today if patient needs it for PICC line placement
   tomorrow
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - hold metoprolol tonight while on pressors
   - hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and on antibiotics
   - would restart coumadin when INR less than 2.5
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold on home BB and ACEi tonight but restart once off pressors and
   stable as he will benefit from afterload reduction
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes:
   - continue HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline (28-30); likely ACD; however macrocytosis and
   last B12/folate over 1 year ago
   - check iron, B12/folate
   - transfuse Hct<21
   .
   # L heel stage II pressure ulcer:  Wound care consulted at recent
   admission
   - Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines
   - Support surface -Atmos Air
   - Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn
   - Heels off bed surface at all times
   - Multipodis Splints to B/L LE's
   - Moisturize B/L LE's  with [**Last Name (un) **] Cream
   - Leave Heels open to air.
   - Place ABD or under scrotom and on sides to prevent friction and
   elevate scrotum.
   .
   # Sacral/Buttock Rash: He has healing unstageable ulcers and a large
   area of macular erythema over entire buttock and lower back
   - continue to monitor, possibly cellulitis, although does not appear to
   be spreading
 blanches, likely stage I not active infection
   - would care consult following patient
   .
   # FEN: Low albumin 1.7 due to chronic malnutrition.
   - NPO
 was choking with trial of foods with nurse today
   - see above for nutrition plans
   .
   # PPX:
   - Supratherapuetic INR effective as DVT prophylaxis
   - No bowel regimen in the setting of diarrhea
   - Strict aspiration precautions
   - Mouthcare q6 hours
   - PPI
   .
   # ACCESS
   - fem line
   .
   # CODE: FULL, discussing with family today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**12-30**] Events:
   - had family meeting, family feels that patient would DNR/DNI but has
   not finalized so patient continues to be FULL CODE, family to decide
   about PEG as well, will have repeat family meeting today
   - urology c/s done, no suprapubic or CBI
   - scotral u/s done: Significant subcutaneous scrotal swelling with no
   hypervascularity and no gas within the tissues identified. This edema
   may be due to third spacing but ultrasound is unable to further
   characterize. A clinical evaluation is recommended to exclude a
   subcutaneous infectious process, and if further imaging is required, a
   CT could be performed. 2) No evidence of an intratesticular mass. No
   evidence of epididymitis or orchitis.

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old male with a complex medical history, including systolic CHF, MCA CVA, afib, HTN, and DM II. He is currently in the ICU with hypotension, respiratory distress, and leukocytosis. He has a history of frequent UTIs with unusual organisms and has grown numerous unusual organisms from his urine in the recent past. He is also experiencing scrotal edema, anasarca, and pressure ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis, low-grade fever, and hypotension are concerning for sepsis, particularly given his history of frequent UTIs.
2. UTI: The patient's frequent UTIs with unusual organisms may lead to further complications, including sepsis, kidney damage, and chronic kidney disease.
3. CHF: The patient's systolic CHF and recent admission for hypotension and respiratory distress may lead to further exacerbation of his CHF symptoms.
4. ARF: The patient's elevated troponin levels and declining kidney function may indicate acute renal failure, which could lead to further complications, including chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
5. Venous clots: The patient's non-occlusive thrombus in the left cephalic vein and history of R DVT may lead to further complications, including pulmonary embolism and chronic venous insufficiency.
6. Pressure ulcers: The patient's pressure ulcers, particularly the stage II pressure ulcer on his heel, may lead to further complications, including infection, tissue damage, and chronic wound care.
7. Sacral/buttock rash: The patient's sacral/buttock rash may indicate cellulitis or a deeper infection, which could lead to further complications, including sepsis and chronic wound care.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia, likely due to chronic malnutrition and macrocytosis, may lead to further complications, including fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, and adjust his treatment plan accordingly.
2. Continue to treat the patient's UTI with triple antibiotics and monitor his response to treatment.
3. Consider further imaging, such as a CT scan, to further evaluate the patient's scrotal edema and potential infectious process.
4. Continue to manage the patient's CHF symptoms with diuretics and monitor his response to treatment.
5. Consider further evaluation and treatment of the patient's ARF, including dialysis, if necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's venous clots and consider further treatment, including anticoagulation therapy, if necessary.
7. Continue to manage the patient's pressure ulcers and sacral/buttock rash with wound care and consider further treatment, including antibiotics, if necessary.
8. Consider further evaluation and treatment of the patient's anemia, including iron and B12/folate supplementation, if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: I suspect hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very
   poor intake since returning to NH per family. However, presence of
   leukocytosis, low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for
   sepsis. Most likely source would be urine. He has very psoitive U/A. Of
   note, he has grown numerous unusual organisms from urine in recent past
   - gentle IVF as has known CHF
   - continue neo and goal to wean, very low dose, able to wean some
   yesterday, but required a lot of IVFs
   - goal MAP>65, CVP 10-12, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn and tailor to cx, added tobramycin for better GN
   coverage
   - f/u blood, urine cx - NGTD
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, intravascularly dry, extravascularly
   overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - oxygen level appropriate on room air despite being positive 6 L
   yesterday
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart tomorrow
   .
   # UTI: Frequent UTI with unusual organsisms. He has large bladder
   divertic with possible fungus ball in bladder and chronic foley
   - treatment as above with triple abx
   - foley changed in ED
   - followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in urology, called urology today for eval,
   will f/u recs
 possible suprapubic cath
   .
   # Pain
 seems to be from scrotal edema, although unable to pinpoint
   exact cause
   - low dose morphine for pain control
   - elevate scrotum for comfort
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Infection w/u as above. Of note, during last admission,
   he was started empirically on Metronidazole on [**12-15**]; however, C. diff
   negative on [**12-16**]
   - flagyl d/c
   - f/u blood, urine, stool cx
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Suspect some trop leak from heart failure in
   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - ruled out bye CEs
   - repeat EKG in AM
   .
   # ARF: Baseline 1.2, now 1.4 which is trending downward
 most likely
   prerenal azotemia
   - gentle IVFs overnight
   - check urine lytes to calc FEUrea
   .
   # Hypernatremia: 148 on admission to 143; resolved with free water
   replacement
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Alkalosis: seen on ABG 7.47/39/211, suspect contraction alkalosis
   from insensible losses
   .
   # Venous clots: He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic
   vein felt to be [**12-20**] PICC line and stable. He also has hx R DVT s/p IVC
   filter
   -supratherapeutic, holding coumadin
   - possible FFP today if patient needs it for PICC line placement
   tomorrow
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - hold metoprolol tonight while on pressors
   - hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and on antibiotics
   - would restart coumadin when INR less than 2.5
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold on home BB and ACEi tonight but restart once off pressors and
   stable as he will benefit from afterload reduction
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes:
   - continue HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline (28-30); likely ACD; however macrocytosis and
   last B12/folate over 1 year ago
   - check iron, B12/folate
   - transfuse Hct<21
   .
   # L heel stage II pressure ulcer:  Wound care consulted at recent
   admission
   - Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines
   - Support surface -Atmos Air
   - Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn
   - Heels off bed surface at all times
   - Multipodis Splints to B/L LE's
   - Moisturize B/L LE's  with [**Last Name (un) **] Cream
   - Leave Heels open to air.
   - Place ABD or under scrotom and on sides to prevent friction and
   elevate scrotum.
   .
   # Sacral/Buttock Rash: He has healing unstageable ulcers and a large
   area of macular erythema over entire buttock and lower back
   - continue to monitor, possibly cellulitis, although does not appear to
   be spreading
 blanches, likely stage I not active infection
   - would care consult
   .
   # FEN: Low albumin 1.7 due to chronic malnutrition.
   - NPO
 was choking with trial of foods with nurse today
   - need to discuss long term nutrition plans with family, may need PEG
   for nutrition, as likely not able to keep fluid intravascularly due to
   his low albumin
   .
   # PPX:
   - Supratherapuetic INR effective as DVT prophylaxis
   - No bowel regimen in the setting of diarrhea
   - Strict aspiration precautions
   - Mouthcare q6 hours
   - PPI
   .
   # ACCESS
   - fem line

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**12-30**] Events:
   - had family meeting, family feels that patient would DNR/DNI but has
   not finalized so patient continues to be FULL CODE, family to decide
   about PEG as well, will have repeat family meeting today
   - urology c/s done, no suprapubic or CBI
   - scotral u/s done: Significant subcutaneous scrotal swelling with no
   hypervascularity and no gas within the tissues identified. This edema
   may be due to third spacing but ultrasound is unable to further
   characterize. A clinical evaluation is recommended to exclude a
   subcutaneous infectious process, and if further imaging is required, a
   CT could be performed. 2) No evidence of an intratesticular mass. No
   evidence of epididymitis or orchitis.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a complex medical history, including systolic heart failure, MCA CVA, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. The patient is currently in the ICU due to hypotension and respiratory distress.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 100/56 mmHg, and he has a history of poor intake since returning to his nursing home. The physician suspects hypovolemia or septic shock, and is considering the possibility of a urinary tract infection (UTI) as the source of the sepsis.
2. CHF: The patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45%, and is experiencing intravascular dryness and extravascular overload. The physician is planning to continue gentle intravenous fluids (IVF) and monitor the patient's response.
3. UTI: The patient has a history of frequent UTIs with unusual organisms, and has a large bladder diverticulum with possible fungus ball in the bladder. The physician is treating the patient with triple antibiotics and has changed the foley catheter.
4. Pain: The patient is experiencing scrotal edema, which is causing pain. The physician is using low-dose morphine for pain control and has elevated the scrotum for comfort.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has a white blood cell count of 17.4 x 10^9/L, and the physician is considering the possibility of an infection. The patient was previously started on metronidazole, but C. difficile was negative.
6. Elevated Troponin: The patient's troponin level is elevated, and the physician suspects some troponin leak from heart failure in addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance.
7. ARF: The patient's creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, and the physician suspects prerenal azotemia. The patient is receiving gentle IVF and will have his urine electrolytes checked to calculate the fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea).
8. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is 148 mmol/L, which has resolved with free water replacement.
9. Alkalosis: The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) pH is 7.47, and the physician suspects contraction alkalosis from insensible losses.
10. Venous clots: The patient has a non-occlusive thrombus in the left cephalic vein, which is felt to be related to the PICC line. The patient also has a history of right deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter.
11. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with rate control medications, and the physician is planning to restart warfarin when the international normalized ratio (INR) is less than 2.5.
12. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is being managed with antihypertensive medications, and the physician is planning to restart the patient's home blood pressure medications once he is off pressors and stable.
13. Type 2 diabetes: The patient's diabetes is being managed with insulin, and the physician is planning to continue this treatment.
14. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.2 g/dL, and the physician is considering the possibility of acute blood loss or chronic malnutrition. The patient is being transfused with packed red blood cells.
15. Pressure ulcer: The patient has a stage II pressure ulcer on his heel, and the physician is planning to continue pressure relief measures, including turning and repositioning the patient every 1-2 hours.
16. Sacral/buttock rash: The patient has a rash on his sacrum and buttocks, which is being monitored for signs of cellulitis. The patient is being treated with topical creams and oral antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. UTI: The patient's history of frequent UTIs and the presence of unusual organisms in his urine suggest the possibility of a UTI, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
3. CHF: The patient's LVEF of 45% and history of systolic heart failure suggest the possibility of CHF exacerbation, which could lead to pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.
4. ARF: The patient's elevated creatinine level and history of acute kidney injury suggest the possibility of ARF, which could lead to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
5. Venous clots: The patient's history of DVT and IVC filter suggests the possibility of venous clots, which could lead to pulmonary embolism and death.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation could lead to stroke and cardiac arrest.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension could lead to cardiovascular complications, including myocardial infarction and stroke.
8. Type 2 diabetes: The patient's diabetes could lead to complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: I suspect hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very
   poor intake since returning to NH per family. However, presence of
   leukocytosis, low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for
   sepsis. Most likely source would be urine. He has very psoitive U/A. Of
   note, he has grown numerous unusual organisms from urine in recent past
   - gentle IVF as has known CHF
   - continue neo and goal to wean, very low dose, able to wean some
   yesterday, but required a lot of IVFs
   - goal MAP>65, CVP 10-12, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn and tailor to cx, added tobramycin for better GN
   coverage
   - f/u blood, urine cx - NGTD
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, intravascularly dry, extravascularly
   overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - oxygen level appropriate on room air despite being positive 6 L
   yesterday
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart tomorrow
   .
   # UTI: Frequent UTI with unusual organsisms. He has large bladder
   divertic with possible fungus ball in bladder and chronic foley
   - treatment as above with triple abx
   - foley changed in ED
   - followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in urology, called urology today for eval,
   will f/u recs
 possible suprapubic cath
   .
   # Pain
 seems to be from scrotal edema, although unable to pinpoint
   exact cause
   - low dose morphine for pain control
   - elevate scrotum for comfort
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Infection w/u as above. Of note, during last admission,
   he was started empirically on Metronidazole on [**12-15**]; however, C. diff
   negative on [**12-16**]
   - flagyl d/c
   - f/u blood, urine, stool cx
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Suspect some trop leak from heart failure in
   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - ruled out bye CEs
   - repeat EKG in AM
   .
   # ARF: Baseline 1.2, now 1.4 which is trending downward
 most likely
   prerenal azotemia
   - gentle IVFs overnight
   - check urine lytes to calc FEUrea
   .
   # Hypernatremia: 148 on admission to 143; resolved with free water
   replacement
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Alkalosis: seen on ABG 7.47/39/211, suspect contraction alkalosis
   from insensible losses
   .
   # Venous clots: He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic
   vein felt to be [**12-20**] PICC line and stable. He also has hx R DVT s/p IVC
   filter
   -supratherapeutic, holding coumadin
   - possible FFP today if patient needs it for PICC line placement
   tomorrow
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - hold metoprolol tonight while on pressors
   - hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and on antibiotics
   - would restart coumadin when INR less than 2.5
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold on home BB and ACEi tonight but restart once off pressors and
   stable as he will benefit from afterload reduction
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes:
   - continue HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline (28-30); likely ACD; however macrocytosis and
   last B12/folate over 1 year ago
   - check iron, B12/folate
   - transfuse Hct<21
   .
   # L heel stage II pressure ulcer:  Wound care consulted at recent
   admission
   - Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines
   - Support surface -Atmos Air
   - Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn
   - Heels off bed surface at all times
   - Multipodis Splints to B/L LE's
   - Moisturize B/L LE's  with [**Last Name (un) **] Cream
   - Leave Heels open to air.
   - Place ABD or under scrotom and on sides to prevent friction and
   elevate scrotum.
   .
   # Sacral/Buttock Rash: He has healing unstageable ulcers and a large
   area of macular erythema over entire buttock and lower back
   - continue to monitor, possibly cellulitis, although does not appear to
   be spreading
 blanches, likely stage I not active infection
   - would care consult

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: I suspect hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very
   poor intake since returning to NH per family. However, presence of
   leukocytosis, low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for
   sepsis. Most likely source would be urine. He has very psoitive U/A. Of
   note, he has grown numerous unusual organisms from urine in recent past
   - gentle IVF as has known CHF
   - continue neo and goal to wean, very low dose, able to wean some
   yesterday, but required a lot of IVFs
   - goal MAP>65, CVP 10-12, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn and tailor to cx, added tobramycin for better GN
   coverage
   - f/u blood, urine cx - NGTD
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, intravascularly dry, extravascularly
   overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - oxygen level appropriate on room air despite being positive 6 L
   yesterday
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart tomorrow
   .
   # UTI: Frequent UTI with unusual organsisms. He has large bladder
   divertic with possible fungus ball in bladder and chronic foley
   - treatment as above with triple abx
   - foley changed in ED
   - followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in urology, called urology today for eval,
   will f/u recs
 possible suprapubic cath
   .
   # Pain
 seems to be from scrotal edema, although unable to pinpoint
   exact cause
   - low dose morphine for pain control
   - elevate scrotum for comfort
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Infection w/u as above. Of note, during last admission,
   he was started empirically on Metronidazole on [**12-15**]; however, C. diff
   negative on [**12-16**]
   - flagyl d/c
   - f/u blood, urine, stool cx
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Suspect some trop leak from heart failure in
   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - ruled out bye CEs
   - repeat EKG in AM
   .
   # ARF: Baseline 1.2, now 1.4 which is trending downward
 most likely
   prerenal azotemia
   - gentle IVFs overnight
   - check urine lytes to calc FEUrea
   .
   # Hypernatremia: 148 on admission to 143; resolved with free water
   replacement
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Alkalosis: seen on ABG 7.47/39/211, suspect contraction alkalosis
   from insensible losses
   .
   # Venous clots: He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic
   vein felt to be [**12-20**] PICC line and stable. He also has hx R DVT s/p IVC
   filter
   -supratherapeutic, holding coumadin
   - possible FFP today if patient needs it for PICC line placement
   tomorrow
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - hold metoprolol tonight while on pressors
   - hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and on antibiotics
   - would restart coumadin when INR less than 2.5
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold on home BB and ACEi tonight but restart once off pressors and
   stable as he will benefit from afterload reduction
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes:
   - continue HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline (28-30); likely ACD; however macrocytosis and
   last B12/folate over 1 year ago
   - check iron, B12/folate
   - transfuse Hct<21
   .
   # L heel stage II pressure ulcer:  Wound care consulted at recent
   admission
   - Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines
   - Support surface -Atmos Air
   - Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn
   - Heels off bed surface at all times
   - Multipodis Splints to B/L LE's
   - Moisturize B/L LE's  with [**Last Name (un) **] Cream
   - Leave Heels open to air.
   - Place ABD or under scrotom and on sides to prevent friction and
   elevate scrotum.
   .
   # Sacral/Buttock Rash: He has healing unstageable ulcers and a large
   area of macular erythema over entire buttock and lower back
   - continue to monitor, possibly cellulitis, although does not appear to
   be spreading
 blanches, likely stage I not active infection
   - would care consult
   .
   # FEN: Low albumin 1.7 due to chronic malnutrition.
   - NPO
 was choking with trial of foods with nurse today
   - need to discuss long term nutrition plans with family, may need PEG
   for nutrition, as likely not able to keep fluid intravascularly due to
   his low albumin
   .

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 89-year-old male with a complex medical history, including systolic CHF, s/p MCA CVA, afib, HTN, and DM II. He presents with hypotension, respiratory distress, and multiple medical complications.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 100/56 mmHg, and he has a history of poor intake since returning to his nursing home. Leukocytosis, low-grade fever, and hypotension are concerning for sepsis, and the most likely source is the urine.
2. CHF: The patient has a reduced ejection fraction of 45% and is intravascularly dry, but extravascularly overloaded. He is receiving gentle IVF, but his CHF is being carefully managed to avoid exacerbating the condition.
3. UTI: The patient has a history of frequent UTIs with unusual organisms. He has a large bladder diverticulum with possible fungus ball in the bladder and chronic foley catheter. He is receiving triple antibiotic therapy, and a suprapubic catheter is being considered.
4. Pain: The patient is experiencing pain from scrotal edema, and his pain is being managed with low-dose morphine.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and infection workup is ongoing. He was previously started on Metronidazole, but C. diff was negative.
6. Elevated Troponin: The patient's troponin level is elevated, and it is suspected that this is due to acute renal failure and decreased clearance, as well as possible trop leak from heart failure.
7. ARF: The patient's creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, and it is likely that this is due to prerenal azotemia.
8. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is 143 mmol/L, which has resolved with free water replacement.
9. Alkalosis: The patient's pH is alkalotic, and it is suspected that this is due to contraction alkalosis from insensible losses.
10. Venous clots: The patient has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic vein, which is felt to be related to his PICC line. He also has a history of right deep vein thrombosis and an inferior vena cava filter.
11. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is in atrial fibrillation and is being managed with anticoagulation therapy.
12. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is being managed with antihypertensive medications.
13. Type 2 Diabetes: The patient's diabetes is being managed with insulin therapy.
14. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.2 g/dL, and he is being evaluated for anemia of chronic disease, macrocytosis, and vitamin B12/folate deficiency.
15. Pressure ulcers: The patient has stage II pressure ulcers on his heels and is being managed with wound care and pressure relief measures.
16. Sacral/Buttock Rash: The patient has a large area of macular erythema over his entire buttock and lower back, which is being monitored for possible cellulitis.
17. FEN: The patient has low albumin due to chronic malnutrition and is being evaluated for possible PEG tube placement for nutrition.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, leukocytosis, and low-grade fever are concerning for sepsis, and the most likely source is the urine.
2. CHF exacerbation: The patient's CHF is being carefully managed, but there is a risk of exacerbation due to his underlying condition and medications.
3. UTI progression: The patient's UTI is being treated with triple antibiotic therapy, but there is a risk of progression and development of resistant organisms.
4. Venous thromboembolism: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis and is at risk for recurrent venous thromboembolism.
5. Anemia progression: The patient's anemia is being evaluated, and there is a risk of progression if underlying causes are not addressed.
6. Pressure ulcer progression: The patient has stage II pressure ulcers, and there is a risk of progression to deeper stages if pressure relief measures are not maintained.
7. Sacral/Buttock Rash progression: The patient's sacral/buttock rash is being monitored for possible cellulitis, and there is a risk of progression if not properly managed.

The patient's code status is FULL CODE, and his family is being educated on his condition and treatment plan."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very poor intake
   since returning to NH per family. However, presence of leukocytosis,
   low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for sepsis. Most likely
   source would be urine. He has very psoitive U/A. Of note, he has grown
   numerous unusual organisms from urine in recent past
   - off pressors now
   - IVF boluses as needed as he had poor Po intake and respiratory status
   is stable
   - continue abx  for UTI coverage
   - f/u blood
 NGTD
   - urine with >100,000 psuedomonas and >100,000 GNR #2
   .
   # UTI: Frequent UTI with unusual organsisms. He has large bladder
   divertic with possible fungus ball in bladder and chronic foley
   - treatment as above with tobra and zosyn; stopped vanco
   - foley changed in ED
   - urology followed, no change in management at this time,do not think
   suprapubic catheter or CBI is warranted
   .
   # Hypernatermia
 replace with D5W
   .
   # Nutrition
 has been NPO since arrival due to aspiration risk, need
   to discuss with family the options for feeding.
   - no peg tube, decided to eat for comfort
   .
   # Pain
 much more comfortable
   - low dose morphine for pain control, is much more comfortable and
   talkative today
   - elevate scrotum for comfort
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Infection w/u as above. Of note, during last admission,
   he was started empirically on Metronidazole on [**12-15**]; however, C. diff
   negative on [**12-16**]
   - flagyl d/c
   - likely from UTI, cont above tx
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, intravascularly dry, extravascularly
   overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - oxygen level appropriate on room air despite being positive 6 L
   yesterday
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart if respiratory status changes
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Suspect some trop leak from heart failure in
   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - ruled out bye CEs
   - stable
   .
   # ARF: Baseline 1.2, now 1.4 which is trending downward
 probably at
   new baseline
   - stable, will continue to follow
   .
   # Venous clots: He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic
   vein felt to be [**12-20**] PICC line and stable. He also has hx R DVT s/p IVC
   filter
   -supratherapeutic, holding coumadin
   - continuing to rise, will hold and reverse only if bleeding
   - possible FFP today if patient needs it for PICC line placement
   tomorrow
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - hold metoprolol tonight while on pressors
   - hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and on antibiotics
   - would restart coumadin when INR less than 2.5
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold on home BB and ACEi due to low BP
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes:
   - continue HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline (28-30); likely ACD; however macrocytosis and
   last B12/folate over 1 year ago
   - check iron, B12/folate
   - transfuse Hct<21
   .
   # L heel stage II pressure ulcer:  Wound care consulted at recent
   admission
   - Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines
   - Support surface -Atmos Air
   - Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn
   - Heels off bed surface at all times
   - Multipodis Splints to B/L LE's
   - Moisturize B/L LE's  with [**Last Name (un) **] Cream
   - Leave Heels open to air.
   - Place ABD or under scrotom and on sides to prevent friction and
   elevate scrotum.
   .
   # Sacral/Buttock Rash: He has healing unstageable ulcers and a large
   area of macular erythema over entire buttock and lower back
   - continue to monitor, possibly cellulitis, although does not appear to
   be spreading
 blanches, likely stage I not active infection
   - would care consult following patient
   .
   # FEN: Low albumin 1.7 due to chronic malnutrition.
   - starting feeds despite aspiration risk
   .
   # PPX:
   - Supratherapuetic INR effective as DVT prophylaxis (INR seemed to have
   peaked)
   - No bowel regimen in the setting of diarrhea
   - Strict aspiration precautions
   - Mouthcare q6 hours
   - PPI
   .
   # ACCESS
   - PICC line

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a complex medical history, including systolic CHF, MCA CVA, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with hypotension and respiratory distress.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 114/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's lung sounds are clear, and the abdomen is soft and non-tender.

The patient has a history of frequent UTIs with unusual organisms, including Pseudomonas and GNR. He has a large bladder diverticulum with a possible fungus ball in the bladder and a chronic foley catheter. The patient's urine output is 610 mL over the past 24 hours, with a specific gravity of 1.024.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 303 K/uL. The patient's troponin level is elevated at 0.25 ng/mL, and his creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL.

The patient's medical conditions include hypotension, UTI, hypernatremia, anemia, and pressure ulcers. The patient's medications include vancomycin, tobramycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, famotidine, and morphine.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue antibiotics for UTI coverage
* Monitor blood glucose levels and adjust insulin as needed
* Provide gentle IVF and careful monitoring of blood pressure
* Hold on lasix tonight and re-evaluate in the morning
* Continue to monitor the patient's troponin level and adjust therapy as needed
* Provide wound care for the patient's pressure ulcers
* Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust therapy as needed
* Provide pain management with morphine as needed

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to UTI
* CHF exacerbation due to IVF or lasix
* Renal failure due to antibiotics or other medications
* Anemia worsening due to chronic malnutrition or bleeding
* Pressure ulcers worsening due to inadequate wound care
* Cellulitis or other skin infections due to poor wound care
* DVT or pulmonary embolism due to immobility or other factors

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medical conditions to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very poor intake
   since returning to NH per family. However, presence of leukocytosis,
   low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for sepsis. Most likely
   source would be urine. He has very psoitive U/A. Of note, he has grown
   numerous unusual organisms from urine in recent past
   - continues to be on low dose neo, will try to wean today
   - IVF boluses as needed as he had poor Po intake and respiratory status
   is stable
   - goal MAP>65, CVP 10-12, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn and tobra for UTI coverage
   - f/u blood
 NGTD
   - urine with >100,000 GNR, no speciation yet
   .
   # UTI: Frequent UTI with unusual organsisms. He has large bladder
   divertic with possible fungus ball in bladder and chronic foley
   - treatment as above with triple abx
   - foley changed in ED
   - urology followed, no change in management at this time,do not think
   suprapubic catheter or CBI is warranted
   .
   # Nutrition
 has been NPO since arrival due to aspiration risk, need
   to discuss with family the options for feeding. Long term care would
   likely require a PEG as his albumin is 1.6 and he has such poor ability
   to keep fluid intravascularly.  If not, consider TPN with eating for
   comfort with known risk of aspiration
   - family talk
   .
   # Pain
 seems to be from scrotal edema, although unable to pinpoint
   exact cause
   - low dose morphine for pain control, is much more comfortable and
   talkative today
   - elevate scrotum for comfort
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Infection w/u as above. Of note, during last admission,
   he was started empirically on Metronidazole on [**12-15**]; however, C. diff
   negative on [**12-16**]
   - flagyl d/c
   - likely from UTI
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, intravascularly dry, extravascularly
   overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - oxygen level appropriate on room air despite being positive 6 L
   yesterday
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart if respiratory status changes
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Suspect some trop leak from heart failure in
   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - ruled out bye CEs
   - stable
   .
   # ARF: Baseline 1.2, now 1.4 which is trending downward
 most likely
   prerenal azotemia
   - stable, will continue to follow
   .
   # Hypernatremia: 148 on admission to 143; resolved with free water
   replacement
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Venous clots: He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic
   vein felt to be [**12-20**] PICC line and stable. He also has hx R DVT s/p IVC
   filter
   -supratherapeutic, holding coumadin
   - continuing to rise, will hold and reverse only if bleeding
   - possible FFP today if patient needs it for PICC line placement
   tomorrow
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - hold metoprolol tonight while on pressors
   - hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and on antibiotics
   - would restart coumadin when INR less than 2.5
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold on home BB and ACEi tonight but restart once off pressors and
   stable as he will benefit from afterload reduction
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes:
   - continue HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline (28-30); likely ACD; however macrocytosis and
   last B12/folate over 1 year ago
   - check iron, B12/folate
   - transfuse Hct<21
   .
   # L heel stage II pressure ulcer:  Wound care consulted at recent
   admission
   - Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines
   - Support surface -Atmos Air
   - Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn
   - Heels off bed surface at all times
   - Multipodis Splints to B/L LE's
   - Moisturize B/L LE's  with [**Last Name (un) **] Cream
   - Leave Heels open to air.
   - Place ABD or under scrotom and on sides to prevent friction and
   elevate scrotum.
   .
   # Sacral/Buttock Rash: He has healing unstageable ulcers and a large
   area of macular erythema over entire buttock and lower back
   - continue to monitor, possibly cellulitis, although does not appear to
   be spreading
 blanches, likely stage I not active infection
   - would care consult following patient
   .
   # FEN: Low albumin 1.7 due to chronic malnutrition.
   - NPO
 was choking with trial of foods with nurse today
   - see above for nutrition plans
   .
   # PPX:
   - Supratherapuetic INR effective as DVT prophylaxis
   - No bowel regimen in the setting of diarrhea
   - Strict aspiration precautions
   - Mouthcare q6 hours
   - PPI
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very poor intake
   since returning to NH per family. However, presence of leukocytosis,
   low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for sepsis. Most likely
   source would be urine. He has very psoitive U/A. Of note, he has grown
   numerous unusual organisms from urine in recent past
   - continues to be on low dose neo, will try to wean today
   - IVF boluses as needed as he had poor Po intake and respiratory status
   is stable
   - goal MAP>65, CVP 10-12, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn and tobra for UTI coverage
   - f/u blood
 NGTD
   - urine with >100,000 GNR, no speciation yet
   .
   # UTI: Frequent UTI with unusual organsisms. He has large bladder
   divertic with possible fungus ball in bladder and chronic foley
   - treatment as above with triple abx
   - foley changed in ED
   - urology followed, no change in management at this time,do not think
   suprapubic catheter or CBI is warranted
   .
   # Nutrition
 has been NPO since arrival due to aspiration risk, need
   to discuss with family the options for feeding. Long term care would
   likely require a PEG as his albumin is 1.6 and he has such poor ability
   to keep fluid intravascularly.  If not, consider TPN with eating for
   comfort with known risk of aspiration
   - family talk
   .
   # Pain
 seems to be from scrotal edema, although unable to pinpoint
   exact cause
   - low dose morphine for pain control, is much more comfortable and
   talkative today
   - elevate scrotum for comfort
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Infection w/u as above. Of note, during last admission,
   he was started empirically on Metronidazole on [**12-15**]; however, C. diff
   negative on [**12-16**]
   - flagyl d/c
   - likely from UTI
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, intravascularly dry, extravascularly
   overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - oxygen level appropriate on room air despite being positive 6 L
   yesterday
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart if respiratory status changes
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Suspect some trop leak from heart failure in
   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - ruled out bye CEs
   - stable
   .
   # ARF: Baseline 1.2, now 1.4 which is trending downward
 most likely
   prerenal azotemia
   - stable, will continue to follow
   .
   # Hypernatremia: 148 on admission to 143; resolved with free water
   replacement
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Venous clots: He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic
   vein felt to be [**12-20**] PICC line and stable. He also has hx R DVT s/p IVC
   filter
   -supratherapeutic, holding coumadin
   - continuing to rise, will hold and reverse only if bleeding
   - possible FFP today if patient needs it for PICC line placement
   tomorrow
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - hold metoprolol tonight while on pressors
   - hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and on antibiotics
   - would restart coumadin when INR less than 2.5
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold on home BB and ACEi tonight but restart once off pressors and
   stable as he will benefit from afterload reduction
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes:
   - continue HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline (28-30); likely ACD; however macrocytosis and
   last B12/folate over 1 year ago
   - check iron, B12/folate
   - transfuse Hct<21
   .
   # L heel stage II pressure ulcer:  Wound care consulted at recent
   admission
   - Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines
   - Support surface -Atmos Air
   - Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn
   - Heels off bed surface at all times
   - Multipodis Splints to B/L LE's
   - Moisturize B/L LE's  with [**Last Name (un) **] Cream
   - Leave Heels open to air.
   - Place ABD or under scrotom and on sides to prevent friction and
   elevate scrotum.
   .
   # Sacral/Buttock Rash: He has healing unstageable ulcers and a large
   area of macular erythema over entire buttock and lower back
   - continue to monitor, possibly cellulitis, although does not appear to
   be spreading
 blanches, likely stage I not active infection
   - would care consult following patient
   .
   # FEN: Low albumin 1.7 due to chronic malnutrition.
   - NPO
 was choking with trial of foods with nurse today
   - see above for nutrition plans
   .
   # PPX:
   - Supratherapuetic INR effective as DVT prophylaxis

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (EF 45%), stroke, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. He presents to the ICU with hypotension, respiratory distress, and sepsis. His laboratory results show leukocytosis, low-grade fever, and elevated troponin levels.

The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with unusual organisms, and his urine analysis shows over 100,000 GNR, with no speciation yet. He has a large bladder diverticulum with possible fungus ball in the bladder and chronic foley catheter. He has been on antibiotics, including vancomycin, tobramycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient's other medical conditions include atrial fibrillation, anemia, and hypernatremia, which has been resolved with free water replacement. He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic vein, which is stable, and he has a history of right deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter.

The patient's nutritional status is poor, with low albumin levels due to chronic malnutrition. He has been NPO since admission due to aspiration risk and is being considered for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for comfort.

The patient's pain management includes low-dose morphine for scrotal edema. His pressure ulcer is stage II, and he has a sacral/buttock rash that is being monitored. He has a femoral line and is receiving prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's UTI and sepsis can lead to further complications, such as organ dysfunction and mortality.
2. Heart failure: The patient's systolic congestive heart failure (EF 45%) can worsen with fluid overload, leading to cardiogenic shock.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not managed properly.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress can worsen with further fluid overload, leading to respiratory failure.
5. Pressure ulcers: The patient's stage II pressure ulcer can worsen with further pressure and friction, leading to deeper ulcers and potential infection.
6. Sacral/buttock rash: The patient's sacral/buttock rash can worsen with further infection and inflammation, leading to cellulitis and potential sepsis.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen with further blood loss or decreased production, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased exercise tolerance.
8. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia can worsen with further fluid overload, leading to central nervous system (CNS) complications, such as seizures and coma.

Based on the patient's condition, I recommend continued close monitoring and management of his sepsis, heart failure, renal failure, respiratory failure, pressure ulcers, sacral/buttock rash, anemia, and hypernatremia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very poor intake
   since returning to NH per family. However, presence of leukocytosis,
   low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for sepsis. Most likely
   source would be urine. He has very psoitive U/A. Of note, he has grown
   numerous unusual organisms from urine in recent past
   - continues to be on low dose neo, will try to wean today
   - IVF boluses as needed as he had poor Po intake and respiratory status
   is stable
   - goal MAP>65, CVP 10-12, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn and tobra for UTI coverage
   - f/u blood
 NGTD
   - urine with >100,000 GNR, no speciation yet
   .
   # UTI: Frequent UTI with unusual organsisms. He has large bladder
   divertic with possible fungus ball in bladder and chronic foley
   - treatment as above with triple abx
   - foley changed in ED
   - urology followed, no change in management at this time,do not think
   suprapubic catheter or CBI is warranted
   .
   # Nutrition
 has been NPO since arrival due to aspiration risk, need
   to discuss with family the options for feeding. Long term care would
   likely require a PEG as his albumin is 1.6 and he has such poor ability
   to keep fluid intravascularly.  If not, consider TPN with eating for
   comfort with known risk of aspiration
   - family talk
   .
   # Pain
 seems to be from scrotal edema, although unable to pinpoint
   exact cause
   - low dose morphine for pain control, is much more comfortable and
   talkative today
   - elevate scrotum for comfort
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Infection w/u as above. Of note, during last admission,
   he was started empirically on Metronidazole on [**12-15**]; however, C. diff
   negative on [**12-16**]
   - flagyl d/c
   - likely from UTI
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, intravascularly dry, extravascularly
   overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - oxygen level appropriate on room air despite being positive 6 L
   yesterday
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart if respiratory status changes
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Suspect some trop leak from heart failure in
   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - ruled out bye CEs
   - stable
   .
   # ARF: Baseline 1.2, now 1.4 which is trending downward
 most likely
   prerenal azotemia
   - stable, will continue to follow
   .
   # Hypernatremia: 148 on admission to 143; resolved with free water
   replacement
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Venous clots: He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic
   vein felt to be [**12-20**] PICC line and stable. He also has hx R DVT s/p IVC
   filter
   -supratherapeutic, holding coumadin
   - continuing to rise, will hold and reverse only if bleeding
   - possible FFP today if patient needs it for PICC line placement
   tomorrow
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - hold metoprolol tonight while on pressors
   - hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and on antibiotics
   - would restart coumadin when INR less than 2.5
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold on home BB and ACEi tonight but restart once off pressors and
   stable as he will benefit from afterload reduction
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes:
   - continue HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline (28-30); likely ACD; however macrocytosis and
   last B12/folate over 1 year ago
   - check iron, B12/folate
   - transfuse Hct<21

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes, who presented to the ICU with hypotension and respiratory distress. He has been NPO since admission due to aspiration risk and has a large bladder diverticulum with possible fungus ball in the bladder. He has a history of frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) with unusual organisms and has grown numerous unusual organisms from his urine in the past.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.6°C, HR 89 bpm, BP 114/68 mmHg, RR 18 inspirations per minute, SpO2 99%
* Respiratory support: Oxygen therapy at 6 L/min
* Cardiovascular: Sinus rhythm, EF 45%, with evidence of CHF and atrial fibrillation
* Renal function: Creatinine 1.4 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 28 mg/dL, with evidence of prerenal azotemia
* Hematological: Leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 17.4 x 10^9/L
* Nutritional: Albumin 1.6 g/dL, with evidence of malnutrition
* Wound care: Pressure ulcer stage II on the heel, with evidence of macular erythema over the entire buttock and lower back

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis, low-grade fever, and hypotension are concerning for sepsis, with the most likely source being the urinary tract.
* UTI: The patient has a history of frequent UTIs with unusual organisms and has grown numerous unusual organisms from his urine in the past.
* CHF: The patient's EF is 45%, with evidence of CHF and atrial fibrillation.
* ARF: The patient's creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL, with evidence of prerenal azotemia.
* Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is 148 mmol/L, with evidence of hypernatremia.
* Venous clots: The patient has a non-occlusive thrombus in the left cephalic vein, which is felt to be related to the PICC line.
* Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.7 g/dL, with evidence of anemia.
* Pressure ulcer: The patient has a pressure ulcer stage II on the heel, with evidence of macular erythema over the entire buttock and lower back.

Assessment and plan:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.
* Continue to provide oxygen therapy at 6 L/min.
* Continue to manage the patient's CHF with gentle IV fluids and hold on lasix until the patient is off pressors.
* Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust fluid management accordingly.
* Continue to monitor the patient's leukocytosis and consider starting antibiotics for sepsis.
* Continue to monitor the patient's UTI and adjust antibiotic coverage accordingly.
* Continue to monitor the patient's pressure ulcer and adjust wound care accordingly.
* Consider referring the patient to a wound care specialist for further management of the pressure ulcer."
