 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PYELONEPHRITIS
   21 year old female with a history of frequent urinary tract infections
   here with pyelopephritis and severe sepsis.
   Respiratory Distress
   Patient had episode of tachypneic and hypoxia last night from flash
   pulmonary edema.  Responded to Lasix 40 mg IV x 1.  Good urine output.
   Differential for causes of the respiratory distress include volume
   overload, cardiogenic pulmonary edemak, pneumonia, congenital heart
   defects, cardiomyopathy.  Pulmonary edema from volume overload is
   possible in light of low albumin, possibly because of sepsis.
   Cardiogenic causes should be explored as flash pulmonary edema in a
   relatively healthy 21 year old is very uncommon.  In light of her
   pyelonephritis, she has a source for possible bacteremia which may seed
   the lungs causing a new pneumonia.  Other considerations are congenital
   defects of the heart, genetic conditions such as HOCM, or
   cardiomyopathies.  Patient
s symptoms responded to diuresis and BIPAP
   which speak more towards pulmonary edema rather than PEs or other
   noncardiogenic causes.
   - add on albumin to today
s labs
   - TTE scheduled for today to evaluate cardiac structure and function
   Severe Sepsis/Pyelonephritits:  Patient with fevers and hypotension in
   the setting of complicated urinary tract infection, but afebrile and
   normal leukocytes today  She received 8 liters of normal saline in the
   emergency and antibiotic coverage with ciprofloxacin and flagyl.
   Currently her systolic blood pressures are in the 90s.  Lactate is
   within normal limits.  Currently no foley to measure urine output.
   Physical exam is notable for crackles at the lung bases.
   - likely adequately fluid resusciated at this time, if persistent
   hypotension or evidence of hypoperfusion will place central line to
   allow for levophed and measurement of CVP and ScvO2
   - target UOP > 30 cc/hr, SBP > 90
   - continue zosyn for antibiotic coverage for complicated pyelonephritis
   - follow urine and blood cultures
   - if concerns of right renal abscess developing, consider repeat CT
   scan if patient worsens clinically
   - UTI prevention counseling
   Metabolic Acidosis:  On presentation serum bicarbonate was 20 with
   anion gap of 12.  Lactate is within normal limits.  Ketones present in
   urine.  Likely related to small degree of starvation ketosis.  Venous
   blood gas on arrival to ICU with pH of 7.38.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) who has been admitted to the ICU with pyelonephritis and severe sepsis. The patient has been treated with antibiotics and diuresis, and has shown improvement in her symptoms.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient has been on non-rebreather mask and nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV, and has been weaned to face mask with 4L of oxygen. Her SpO2 is 97% on FiO2 40%.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has been treated with Lasix 40mg IV for pulmonary edema, and has shown improvement in her symptoms. Her blood pressure is in the 90s, and her lactate levels are within normal limits.
* Renal status: The patient has been diagnosed with pyelonephritis, and has been treated with antibiotics. Her urine output has been increasing, and she is currently producing 2.5L of urine per day.
* Hematological status: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and she has been diagnosed with sepsis.

The patient's medical complications are:

* Pulmonary edema: The patient has developed pulmonary edema, which has responded to diuresis and BIPAP.
* Pyelonephritis: The patient has been diagnosed with pyelonephritis, which is a complication of her UTI.
* Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and her platelet count is normal.
* Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): The patient's BUN levels are elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction.
* Creatinine: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction.
* Electrolytes: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with low sodium and potassium levels.
* Blood Glucose: The patient's blood glucose levels are normal.

The patient's treatment plan is as follows:

* Antibiotics: The patient will continue to receive antibiotics for her UTI and pyelonephritis.
* Diuresis: The patient will continue to receive diuresis to treat her pulmonary edema.
* Fluid resuscitation: The patient will continue to receive fluid resuscitation to treat her hypotension.
* Monitoring: The patient will be closely monitored for signs of worsening sepsis, and will have repeat laboratory tests to monitor her kidney function and electrolyte levels.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent further complications."

 PYELONEPHRITIS
   21 year old female with a history of frequent urinary tract infections
   here with pyelopephritis and severe sepsis.
   Respiratory Distress
   Severe Sepsis/Pyelonephritits:  Patient with fevers and hypotension in
   the setting of complicated urinary tract infection.  She received 8
   liters of normal saline in the emergency and antibiotic coverage with
   ciprofloxacin and flagyl.  Currently her systolic blood pressures are
   in the 90s.  Lactate is within normal limits.  Currently no foley to
   measure urine output.  Physical exam is notable for crackles at the
   lung bases.
   - place foley for closer monitoring of urine output
   - likely adequately fluid resusciated at this time, if persistent
   hypotension or evidence of hypoperfusion will place central line to
   allow for levophed and measurement of CVP and ScvO2
   - target UOP > 30 cc/hr, SBP > 90
   - zosyn for antibiotic coverage for complicated pyelonephritis
   - follow urine and blood cultures
   - follow final read of CT scan
   - trend lactate
   - repeat urinalysis once foley placed given presence of epithilial
   cells on sample from ER
   Metabolic Acidosis:  On presentation serum bicarbonate was 20 with
   anion gap of 12.  Lactate is within normal limits.  Ketones present in
   urine.  Likely related to small degree of starvation ketosis.  Venous
   blood gas on arrival to ICU with pH of 7.38.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of frequent urinary tract infections, currently admitted to the ICU with pyelonephritis and severe sepsis. The patient's condition is characterized by:

1. Pyelonephritis: The patient has a CT scan showing striated nephrogram on the right, indicative of right pyelonephritis. The urology consult suggests that the contrast in the right kidney is likely pooling in the pelvis due to infection, and the patient will require outpatient follow-up for recurrent UTIs.
2. Severe Sepsis: The patient has fever, tachypnea, desaturation, and slight bloody sputum, which is consistent with severe sepsis. The patient was given lasix 40 IV, responded well, and produced approximately 2.5L of output.
3. Hypotension: The patient's systolic blood pressure is in the 90s, which is considered hypotensive.
4. Respiratory Distress: The patient has crackles at the lung bases, which is consistent with pulmonary edema.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a serum bicarbonate level of 20 and an anion gap of 12, which is indicative of metabolic acidosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Renal failure: The patient's pyelonephritis and sepsis can lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and respiratory distress can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or chronic respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy: The patient's sepsis can lead to cardiomyopathy, which can result in heart failure.
4. Metabolic acidosis-related complications: The patient's metabolic acidosis can lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and decreased consciousness.
5. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections: The patient's indwelling urinary catheter can increase the risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infections.

To address these potential complications, the patient's treatment plan should include:

1. Aggressive fluid resuscitation to maintain adequate blood pressure and urine output.
2. Antibiotic coverage for complicated pyelonephritis, including zosyn for antibiotic coverage.
3. Monitoring of urine output and blood pressure to ensure adequate resuscitation.
4. Trending of lactate levels to monitor for signs of sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy.
5. Monitoring of electrolyte levels to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
6. Regular assessments of the patient's respiratory status to prevent respiratory failure.
7. Monitoring of the patient's cardiac status to prevent sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy.
8. Regular urinalysis to monitor for signs of catheter-associated urinary tract infections."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to acute pulmonary edema in context
   of volume resussitation, marked postive fluid balance.  Doubt pulmonary
   edema, pneumonia.  Supported by radiograph.  Improved following net
   diuresis since onset.  Follow up CXR, as pt at risk for ARDS.
   HYPOTENSION  -- improved with fluid resussitation.  Attributed to
   sepsis and hypovolemia.  No evidence or concern for other etiologies
   such as GI bleed, cardiac decompensation or pulmonary embolism.
   Monitor BP, Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  [**Month (only) 11**] require central line for CVP,
   SvO2 monitoring if remains hypotensive
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- attributed to cardiogenic, less likely ARDS.
   Pulmonary edema in setting of volume repletion.  Will assess cardiac
   function to assess for valvular disease.
   SEPSIS SYNDROME -- attributed to urinary source.  Continue current
   level of support.  [**Month (only) 11**] require central line.  Monitor for evidence of
   ARDS.  Continue antimicrobials.
   PYELONEPHRITIS, RIGHT -- supported by abd CT.  No contrast seen beyond
   right renal pelvis, suggesting possible obstruction such as stone -->
   would check renal US.  No immediate plans for Urology.  Urine culture
   with GNR
 await identification and antibiotic sensitivities.
   FLUIDS
 volume resussitated.  Allow net negative.  Monitor UO, I/O.
   Monitor electrolytes during active diuresis.
   NUTRITONAL SUPPORT
 encourage PO
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- Repleted. Monitor.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA
 Repleted. Monitor.
   HYPOMAGNESEMIA
 Continue to replete.  Monitor.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to acute pulmonary edema in context
   of volume resussitation, marked postive fluid balance.  Doubt pulmonary
   edema, pneumonia.  Supported by radiograph.  Improved following net
   diuresis since onset.  Follow up CXR, as pt at risk for ARDS.
   HYPOTENSION  -- improved with fluid resussitation.  Attributed to
   sepsis and hypovolemia.  No evidence or concern for other etiologies
   such as GI bleed, cardiac decompensation or pulmonary embolism.
   Monitor BP, Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  [**Month (only) 11**] require central line for CVP,
   SvO2 monitoring if remains hypotensive
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- attributed to cardiogenic, less likely ARDS.
   Pulmonary edema in setting of volume repletion.  Will assess cardiac
   function to assess for valvular disease.
   SEPSIS SYNDROME -- attributed to urinary source.  Continue current
   level of support.  [**Month (only) 11**] require central line.  Monitor for evidence of
   ARDS.  Continue antimicrobials.
   PYELONEPHRITIS, RIGHT -- supported by abd CT.  No contrast seen beyond
   right renal pelvis, suggesting possible obstruction such as stone -->
   would check renal US.  No immediate plans for Urology.  Urine culture
   with GNR
 await identification and antibiotic sensitivities.
   FLUIDS
 volume resussitated.  Allow net negative.  Monitor UO, I/O.
   Monitor electrolytes during active diuresis.
   NUTRITONAL SUPPORT

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient experienced an episode of respiratory distress, which was managed with mask ventilation, lasix, and good clinical improvement. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, and blood pressure of 95/38 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and is mechanically ventilated.

The patient's physical examination is notable for right flank pain, which has improved, and peripheral edema in both lower extremities. The patient's neurological examination is normal, with no signs of sedation or paralysis.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 139 K/uL. The patient's blood chemistry profile shows hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia, which are being managed with fluids and electrolyte supplementation.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Respiratory distress attributed to acute pulmonary edema, which has improved following diuresis.
2. Hypotension attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia, which is being managed with fluid resuscitation and monitoring of blood pressure.
3. Pulmonary edema attributed to cardiogenic causes, which will be assessed for valvular disease.
4. Sepsis syndrome attributed to urinary source, which is being managed with antimicrobials and central line placement.
5. Pyelonephritis, right, which is being managed with antibiotics and monitoring for evidence of ARDS.
6. Fluid management, including volume resuscitation and net negative fluid balance.
7. Nutrition support, including encouragement of oral intake.
8. Hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia, which are being managed with supplementation.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and pulmonary edema may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis syndrome may lead to organ dysfunction, including renal, hepatic, or cardiovascular failure.
3. Pyelonephritis-related complications: The patient's pyelonephritis may lead to complications such as sepsis, ARDS, or chronic kidney disease.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or other complications if not managed properly.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid resuscitation may lead to fluid overload, which can exacerbate respiratory distress and other complications."

   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to acute pulmonary edema in context
   of volume resussitation, marked postive fluid balance.  Doubt pulmonary
   edema, pneumonia.  Supported by radiograph.  Improved following net
   diuresis since onset.  Follow up CXR, as pt at risk for ARDS.
   HYPOTENSION  -- improved with fluid resussitation.  Attributed to
   sepsis and hypovolemia.  No evidence or concern for other etiologies
   such as GI bleed, cardiac decompensation or pulmonary embolism.
   Monitor BP, Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  [**Month (only) 11**] require central line for CVP,
   SvO2 monitoring if remains hypotensive
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- attributed to cardiogenic, less likely ARDS.
   Pulmonary edema in setting of volume repletion.  Will assess cardiac
   function to assess for valvular disease.
   SEPSIS SYNDROME -- attributed to urinary source.  Continue current
   level of support.  [**Month (only) 11**] require central line.  Monitor for evidence of
   ARDS.  Continue antimicrobials.
   PYELONEPHRITIS, RIGHT -- supported by abd CT.  No contrast seen beyond
   right renal pelvis, suggesting possible obstruction such as stone -->
   would check renal US.  No immediate plans for Urology.  Urine culture
   with GNR
 await identification and antibiotic sensitivities.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to acute pulmonary edema in context
   of volume resussitation, marked postive fluid balance.  Doubt pulmonary
   edema, pneumonia.  Supported by radiograph.  Improved following net
   diuresis since onset.  Follow up CXR, as pt at risk for ARDS.
   HYPOTENSION  -- improved with fluid resussitation.  Attributed to
   sepsis and hypovolemia.  No evidence or concern for other etiologies
   such as GI bleed, cardiac decompensation or pulmonary embolism.
   Monitor BP, Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  [**Month (only) 11**] require central line for CVP,
   SvO2 monitoring if remains hypotensive
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- attributed to cardiogenic, less likely ARDS.
   Pulmonary edema in setting of volume repletion.  Will assess cardiac
   function to assess for valvular disease.
   SEPSIS SYNDROME -- attributed to urinary source.  Continue current
   level of support.  [**Month (only) 11**] require central line.  Monitor for evidence of
   ARDS.  Continue antimicrobials.
   PYELONEPHRITIS, RIGHT -- supported by abd CT.  No contrast seen beyond
   right renal pelvis, suggesting possible obstruction such as stone -->
   would check renal US.  No immediate plans for Urology.  Urine culture
   with GNR
 await identification and antibiotic sensitivities.
   FLUIDS
 volume resussitated.  Allow net negative.  Monitor UO, I/O.
   Monitor electrolytes during active diuresis.
   NUTRITONAL SUPPORT

   HYPOCALCEMIA -- Repleted. Monitor.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient experienced an episode of respiratory distress, which was managed with mask ventilation, Lasix, and good clinical improvement. The patient's right flank pain improved, and they were found to have a urinary source of sepsis. The patient has been receiving antimicrobials and is being supported with mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress and pulmonary edema put them at risk for developing ARDS.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's hypotension and pulmonary edema may be attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia, but further assessment is needed to rule out cardiac decompensation or valvular disease.
3. Sepsis-Induced Multi-Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (SIRS): The patient's sepsis syndrome may lead to SIRS, which can result in multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Pyelonephritis: The patient's urinary source of sepsis and right flank pain suggest the possibility of pyelonephritis, which may require further investigation and treatment.
5. Hypocalcemia, Hypophosphatemia, and Hypomagnesemia: The patient's electrolyte imbalances require close monitoring and repletion to prevent complications.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid resussitation and positive fluid balance put them at risk for fluid overload, which can lead to cardiac complications.
7. Catheter-Related Complications: The patient's central line and urinary catheter increase the risk of catheter-related complications, such as sepsis, bleeding, and mechanical complications.
8. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's inability to take oral nutrition and potential for prolonged ICU stay put them at risk for nutritional deficiencies, including malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antimicrobial therapy and monitor for evidence of ARDS.
2. Assess cardiac function to rule out cardiac decompensation or valvular disease.
3. Monitor electrolytes and replete as necessary to prevent complications.
4. Monitor fluid balance and adjust fluid management to prevent fluid overload.
5. Consider renal US to investigate right flank pain and potential obstruction.
6. Encourage oral nutrition and monitor for nutritional deficiencies.
7. Monitor for signs of catheter-related complications and take prompt action to prevent or treat them."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 21-year-old female admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis and pyelonephritis. She has a history of frequent urinary tract infections. She is currently receiving treatment with antibiotics, fluids, and oxygen therapy. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 99-100°F, heart rate of 57-104 bpm, and blood pressure of 101/62-107/89 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen therapy with a saturation of 95%. Her physical examination reveals bilateral pleural effusions and ascites, as well as a soft and tender abdomen.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum is pink-tinged, which may indicate the presence of blood, and her chest X-ray shows bilateral pleural effusions. This increases the risk of pneumonia.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen requirements are high, and her respiratory rate is 15-29 breaths per minute. This may indicate respiratory muscle fatigue or failure.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's heart rate is elevated, and her blood pressure is labile. This may indicate cardiac instability or failure.
4. Renal Complications: The patient's pyelonephritis may lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Septic Shock: The patient's temperature is elevated, and her blood pressure is low. This may indicate the development of septic shock.
6. Vascular Complications: The patient's electrolyte imbalance and hypotension may increase the risk of vascular complications such as DVT or pulmonary embolism.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's abdominal tenderness and guarding may indicate the presence of intra-abdominal pathology such as abscesses or perforation.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's elevated temperature and blood pressure may increase the risk of neurological complications such as seizures or stroke.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and antipyretics to treat the patient's sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs closely and adjust oxygen therapy as needed.
3. Perform a thorough physical examination to assess for any new symptoms or signs of complications.
4. Consider ordering additional imaging studies such as a CT scan or ultrasound to evaluate the patient's abdominal and renal anatomy.
5. Consult with a nephrologist or urologist to optimize the patient's treatment and management.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust fluids and medications as needed to prevent further complications."

 PULMONARY EDEMA
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PYELONEPHRITIS
   21 year old female with a history of frequent urinary tract infections
   here with pyelopephritis and severe sepsis.
   Respiratory Distress
   Patient had episode of tachypneic and hypoxia last night from flash
   pulmonary edema.  Responded to Lasix 40 mg IV x 1.  Good urine output.
   Differential for causes of the respiratory distress include volume
   overload, cardiogenic pulmonary edemak, pneumonia, congenital heart
   defects, cardiomyopathy.  Pulmonary edema from volume overload is
   possible in light of low albumin, possibly because of sepsis.
   Cardiogenic causes should be explored as flash pulmonary edema in a
   relatively healthy 21 year old is very uncommon.  In light of her
   pyelonephritis, she has a source for possible bacteremia which may seed
   the lungs causing a new pneumonia.  Other considerations are congenital
   defects of the heart, genetic conditions such as HOCM, or
   cardiomyopathies.  Patient
s symptoms responded to diuresis and BIPAP
   which speak more towards pulmonary edema rather than PEs or other
   noncardiogenic causes.
   - add on albumin to today
s labs
   - TTE scheduled for today to evaluate cardiac structure and function
   Severe Sepsis/Pyelonephritits:  Patient with fevers and hypotension in
   the setting of complicated urinary tract infection, but afebrile and
   normal leukocytes today  She received 8 liters of normal saline in the
   emergency and antibiotic coverage with ciprofloxacin and flagyl.
   Currently her systolic blood pressures are in the 90s.  Lactate is
   within normal limits.  Currently no foley to measure urine output.
   Physical exam is notable for crackles at the lung bases.
   - likely adequately fluid resusciated at this time, if persistent
   hypotension or evidence of hypoperfusion will place central line to
   allow for levophed and measurement of CVP and ScvO2
   - target UOP > 30 cc/hr, SBP > 90
   - continue zosyn for antibiotic coverage for complicated pyelonephritis
   - follow urine and blood cultures
   - if concerns of right renal abscess developing, consider repeat CT
   scan if patient worsens clinically
   - UTI prevention counseling
   Metabolic Acidosis:  On presentation serum bicarbonate was 20 with
   anion gap of 12.  Lactate is within normal limits.  Ketones present in
   urine.  Likely related to small degree of starvation ketosis.  Venous
   blood gas on arrival to ICU with pH of 7.38.
   - trend bicarbonate for now
   - check PM electrolytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 PULMONARY EDEMA
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PYELONEPHRITIS
   21 year old female with a history of frequent urinary tract infections
   here with pyelopephritis and severe sepsis.
   Respiratory Distress
   Patient had episode of tachypneic and hypoxia last night from flash
   pulmonary edema.  Responded to Lasix 40 mg IV x 1.  Good urine output.
   Differential for causes of the respiratory distress include volume
   overload, cardiogenic pulmonary edemak, pneumonia, congenital heart
   defects, cardiomyopathy.  Pulmonary edema from volume overload is
   possible in light of low albumin, possibly because of sepsis.
   Cardiogenic causes should be explored as flash pulmonary edema in a
   relatively healthy 21 year old is very uncommon.  In light of her
   pyelonephritis, she has a source for possible bacteremia which may seed
   the lungs causing a new pneumonia.  Other considerations are congenital
   defects of the heart, genetic conditions such as HOCM, or
   cardiomyopathies.  Patient
s symptoms responded to diuresis and BIPAP
   which speak more towards pulmonary edema rather than PEs or other
   noncardiogenic causes.
   - add on albumin to today
s labs
   - TTE scheduled for today to evaluate cardiac structure and function
   Severe Sepsis/Pyelonephritits:  Patient with fevers and hypotension in
   the setting of complicated urinary tract infection, but afebrile and
   normal leukocytes today  She received 8 liters of normal saline in the
   emergency and antibiotic coverage with ciprofloxacin and flagyl.
   Currently her systolic blood pressures are in the 90s.  Lactate is
   within normal limits.  Currently no foley to measure urine output.
   Physical exam is notable for crackles at the lung bases.
   - likely adequately fluid resusciated at this time, if persistent
   hypotension or evidence of hypoperfusion will place central line to
   allow for levophed and measurement of CVP and ScvO2
   - target UOP > 30 cc/hr, SBP > 90
   - continue zosyn for antibiotic coverage for complicated pyelonephritis
   - follow urine and blood cultures
   - if concerns of right renal abscess developing, consider repeat CT
   scan if patient worsens clinically
   - UTI prevention counseling
   Metabolic Acidosis:  On presentation serum bicarbonate was 20 with
   anion gap of 12.  Lactate is within normal limits.  Ketones present in
   urine.  Likely related to small degree of starvation ketosis.  Venous
   blood gas on arrival to ICU with pH of 7.38.
   - trend bicarbonate for now
   - check PM electrolytes

Summary:

The patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) who presented with pyelonephritis and severe sepsis. She had an episode of tachypneic and hypoxia last night due to flash pulmonary edema, which responded to Lasix 40 mg IV and good urine output. The patient's symptoms responded to diuresis and BIPAP, suggesting pulmonary edema rather than pulmonary embolism or other non-cardiogenic causes. She has a low albumin level, which may be related to sepsis. The patient's sepsis is being managed with antibiotics, fluids, and vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is ongoing, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Monitoring of her respiratory status and oxygenation is crucial.
2. Sepsis-Related Organ Dysfunction: The patient's sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and coagulopathy. Monitoring of her laboratory values and clinical status is essential.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely related to small degree of starvation ketosis, but it is essential to monitor her electrolyte levels and acid-base status.
4. Right Renal Abscess: There is a risk of right renal abscess developing, which would require repeat CT scan if the patient worsens clinically.
5. UTI Prevention: The patient is at risk of developing UTI again, and UTI prevention counseling is essential.
6. Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may be related to cardiogenic causes, which would require further evaluation with a TTE and other diagnostic tests.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's pyelonephritis may seed the lungs, causing a new pneumonia, which would require antibiotic coverage and monitoring.
8. Congenital Heart Defects or Cardiomyopathy: The patient's flash pulmonary edema may be related to congenital heart defects or cardiomyopathy, which would require further evaluation with a TTE and other diagnostic tests.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status, oxygenation, and cardiovascular function.
2. Monitor the patient's laboratory values, including electrolyte levels, acid-base status, and blood cultures.
3. Consider repeat CT scan if the patient worsens clinically.
4. Provide UTI prevention counseling.
5. Consider further evaluation with a TTE and other diagnostic tests to rule out cardiogenic causes of pulmonary edema.
6. Continue antibiotic coverage for complicated pyelonephritis.
7. Monitor the patient's urine output and adjust fluid management accordingly.
8. Consider placing a central line to allow for levophed and measurement of CVP and ScvO2 if the patient's hypotension persists."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to acute pulmonary edema in context
   of volume resussitation, marked postive fluid balance.  Doubt
   non-cardiogneic pulmonary edema, pneumonia.  Supported by radiograph.
   Continues to improve, now spontaneously diuresing.  Follow up CXR.
   HYPOTENSION  -- Resolved.  Attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia.  No
   evidence or concern for other etiologies such as GI bleed, cardiac
   decompensation or pulmonary embolism.  Monitor BP, Maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  [**Month (only) 11**] require central line for CVP, SvO2 monitoring if remains
   hypotensive
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- attributed to cardiogenic, less likely ARDS.
   Pulmonary edema in setting of volume repletion.  Will assess cardiac
   function to assess for valvular disease.
   SEPSIS SYNDROME -- attributed to urinary source.  Resolved.  Continue
   antimicrobials.
   PYELONEPHRITIS, RIGHT -- supported by abd CT.  No contrast seen beyond
   right renal pelvis, suggesting possible obstruction such as stone -->
   would check renal US.  No immediate plans for Urology.  Urine culture
   with GNR
 await identification and antibiotic sensitivities.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a septic individual who has been treated with antibiotics and is currently receiving fluids and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, and blood pressure of 103/63 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 90% and ABG results of 7.25/25 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress. The patient's cardiovascular examination is normal, with a normal pulse and blood pressure. The patient's respiratory examination is also normal, with clear breath sounds and no wheezing. The patient's abdominal examination is normal, with soft and non-tender abdomen and bowel sounds present.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 139 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are normal, with a sodium level of 137 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L, and chloride level of 103 mEq/L.

The patient's medical conditions include sepsis, acute pulmonary edema, hypotension, pulmonary edema, pyelonephritis, and hypocalcemia. The patient is currently receiving treatment for these conditions, including antibiotics, fluids, and other medications.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may continue to worsen if the underlying infection is not effectively treated, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Acute pulmonary edema: The patient's acute pulmonary edema may continue to worsen if the underlying cause is not addressed, leading to respiratory failure and death.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may continue to worsen if the underlying cause is not addressed, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may continue to worsen if the underlying cause is not addressed, leading to respiratory failure and death.
5. Pyelonephritis: The patient's pyelonephritis may continue to worsen if the underlying cause is not addressed, leading to kidney damage and failure.
6. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia may continue to worsen if the underlying cause is not addressed, leading to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and other complications.

In conclusion, the patient is a septic individual with multiple medical conditions that require close monitoring and treatment. The patient's condition may continue to worsen if the underlying causes are not effectively addressed, leading to potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to acute pulmonary edema in context
   of volume resussitation, marked postive fluid balance.  Doubt
   non-cardiogneic pulmonary edema, pneumonia.  Supported by radiograph.
   Continues to improve, now spontaneously diuresing.  Follow up CXR.
   HYPOTENSION  -- Resolved.  Attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia.  No
   evidence or concern for other etiologies such as GI bleed, cardiac
   decompensation or pulmonary embolism.  Monitor BP, Maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  [**Month (only) 11**] require central line for CVP, SvO2 monitoring if remains
   hypotensive
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- attributed to cardiogenic, less likely ARDS.
   Pulmonary edema in setting of volume repletion.  Will assess cardiac
   function to assess for valvular disease.
   SEPSIS SYNDROME -- attributed to urinary source.  Resolved.  Continue
   antimicrobials.
   PYELONEPHRITIS, RIGHT -- supported by abd CT.  No contrast seen beyond
   right renal pelvis, suggesting possible obstruction such as stone -->
   would check renal US.  No immediate plans for Urology.  Urine culture
   with GNR
 await identification and antibiotic sensitivities.
   FLUIDS
 volume resussitated.  Allow net negative.  Monitor UO, I/O.
   Monitor electrolytes during active diuresis.
   NUTRITONAL SUPPORT
 encourage PO
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- Repleted. Monitor.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA
 Repleted. Monitor.
   HYPOMAGNESEMIA
 Continue to replete.  Monitor.

* Heart rate: 100 bpm (56-104 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 103/63 mmHg (72-108/89 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 18 inspirations per minute (15-29 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 90%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient is receiving nasal cannula oxygen delivery and has an arterial blood gas (ABG) reading of pH 7.25.

The patient's physical examination reveals the following:

* General appearance: Well-nourished, no acute distress, no signs of overweight or obesity
* Eyes and conjunctiva: PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), no conjunctival pallor or scleral edema
* Head, ears, nose, and throat: Normocephalic, no poor dentition, no endotracheal tube, no NG or OG tube
* Lymphatic: Cervical lymph nodes are within normal limits
* Cardiovascular: Normal pulse, no murmurs, no rubs
* Respiratory: Clear breath sounds, no wheezes or crackles
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
* Extremities: Right lower extremity edema: trace, left lower extremity edema: trace
* Skin: Warm, no rash or jaundice
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person, place, and time, and has normal tone

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 12.5, 13.4, and 7.2
* Hemoglobin: 12.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 139, 246, and 256
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.8 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.1 g/dL
* Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 129, 98, 106, 127, and 99

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Sepsis syndrome attributed to urinary source, which has resolved
* Pyelonephritis, right, supported by abdominal CT
* Pulmonary edema attributed to cardiogenic, less likely ARDS
* Hypotension attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia
* Hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia, which have been repleted
* Right lower extremity edema: trace

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antimicrobial therapy for pyelonephritis
* Fluid management to allow net negative fluid balance
* Monitoring of electrolytes during active diuresis
* Encouragement of oral nutrition
* Glycemic control
* Line management (18-gauge and 20-gauge lines)
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Development of ARDS
* Cardiac arrhythmias or failure
* Renal failure or acute kidney injury
* Respiratory failure or ventilator dependence
* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Electrolyte imbalances
* Hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or hypomagnesemia
* Right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism"
