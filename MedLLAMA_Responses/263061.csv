   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of thyroid cancer, COPD, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She was found to be lethargic by nursing home staff and was brought to the emergency department (ED) where she was found to be awake but confused. She had a Foley catheter placed that drained purulent material.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15,000
* Hypokalemia with a potassium level of 6.3
* Elevated creatinine level of 3.9
* Elevated troponin level of 0.9
* Elevated lactate level of 1.7
* Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 41
* Elevated serum glucose level of 114

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Tachycardia with a heart rate of 140 beats per minute
* Hypotension with a blood pressure of 158/98 mmHg
* Respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation of 94% on room air
* Peripheral vascular examination was not performed due to patient's condition
* Skin examination was not performed due to patient's condition
* Neurologic examination was not performed due to patient's condition

The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, altered mental status, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She has been treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and fluids.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Progressive septic shock leading to organ dysfunction or failure
* Worsening of chronic kidney disease (CKD) leading to acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Development of pneumonia or other secondary infections
* Progression of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) leading to respiratory failure
* Development of electrolyte imbalances or acid-base disorders due to chronic kidney disease (CKD)
* Development of bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy
* Development of cardiac complications due to septic shock or underlying cardiac disease

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with dementia, COPD, thyroid cancer, [**Hospital1 **] resident, presenting with
   lethargy and found to have septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and
   ARF.  Was stable and off pressors overnight.  This morning became
   hypotensive to SBP in 70s and went into Afib after levophed restarted
   and half of 1L fluid bolus received.  Currently back on pressors, but
   now phenylephrine.
   .
   # Septic shock/UTI.  Presumed urinary source with clearly positive UA
   in [**Hospital1 **] patient. Cardiac enzymes negative.  No evidence of pneumonia.
   No recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest C.diff.
   Blood cultures and urine cultures pending.
   - obtain collateral info from [**Hospital1 **] and PCP and family.
   - consider alternative sources if no improvement evaluation - bloods
   pending, CXR without clear pneumonia; abdomen seems tender though
   denies pain; could consider imaging if not improving.
   - Maintain CVPs 8-12.
   - Continue phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with Goal MAPs > 65.
   - Repeat lactate in PM.
   - Monitor central venous sats with sepsis cath or labs, consider
   inotropes if < 70.
   - Pressors: Norepi, titrate to MAP >60-65.
   - Antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with double GNR coverage
   - cefepime and cipro plus vanc for enterococcus; consider VRE coverage
   if no improvement.
   - Consider cortisol check or [**Last Name (un) **] stim.
   .
   # ARF on CKD.  Has noted CKD per [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not clear.
   Was taking K supplements at [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely this represents some degree
   of acute insufficiency.  Simple prerenal from volume depletion/poor
   flow vs. ATN from ischemia most likely.  No reason for postobstructive
   process.
   - Consider renal US if no improvment on PM labs.
   - baseline creatinine.
   - Check urine lytes.
   - Repeat lytes this PM.
   - Management of hyperkalemia as below.
   - Avoid hypotension; bolus prn to maintain CVPs.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.  Combination of ARF, K supplementation at [**Hospital1 **] in this
   setting, and [**Last Name (un) **] use.  No DKA or hyperosmolality present.
   - Monitor ECGs; Ca gluc prn K related changes.
   - Insulin and D50 for temporizing; expect total body K to improve with
   improvement in urine output.
   - Repeat lytes now.
   - Consider renal involvement if next K check not improved.
   .
   # Lethargy.  Likely due to systemic illness.  Nothing focal on exam to
   suggest focal CNS process.  Also on a number of sedating meds which may
   be affected by renal failure.
   - Consider head CT.
   - Management of septic shock as above.
   - Hold depakote, risperdone (partially renally cleared), wellbutrin,
   trazodone for now.  Check valproate level.
   .
   # ECG changes.  ST depressions in ECG in ED but this tracing most
   likely affected by poor lead positioning leading to early R wave
   transition.  Now with ST depressions more likely related to
   hypertrophy/IVCD.
   - Cycle enzymes.
   - Supportive care.
   - Consider ASA/statin if more significant elevation.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Likely related to renal failure, lactate only
   minimally elevated.
   - Continue to trend.
   - VBG for pH.
   .
   FEN: bolus prn, replete electrolytes, NPO for now.
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, H2B.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 70F with h/o thyroid cancer, COPD, [**Hospital 2443**] nursing home
   resident, found by [**Hospital1 **] staff to be lethargic on morning of [**2113-3-27**]. O2
   sat was 84% on RA. Brought by EMS to [**Hospital1 5**] ED and found to be awake but
   confused but arousable and denied [**Doctor First Name **] pain.  She was hypotensive at
   65/34, and had a Foley placed that drained purulent material.
   Labs were notable for a leukocytosis to 15K, K of 6.3, creatinine of
   3.9, lactate of 1.7, troponin of 0.9.
   UA was positive for WBCs and bacteria.
   ECG showed ST depressions in anterior leads.
   Patient had a LIJ placed in ED and received vanc, levo, and
   ceftriaxone, and 3L NS.
   24 Hour Events:
 NASAL SWAB - At [**2113-3-27**] 09:20 PM mrsa swab
   [**3-27**] to [**3-28**]
   - Arrived in [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] and norepinephrine weaned from 0.3 to almost off.
   - Added ciprofloxacin for extra GNR coverage.
   - Repeat K and Cr were improved.
   - Repeat EKG improved from ED.
   - Spoke with son [**Name (NI) 768**] [**Name (NI) 6192**] (HCP): full ICU consent and full code.
   Mother has debilitating psychiatric disease and is not in contact with
   family.  She spent several years in [**Hospital3 3298**] ""sitting in the
   dark, smoking many packs of cigarettes a day"" before moving to nursing
   home two years ago.
   - Pt became progressively more aware and responsive overnight,
   especially with mention of talking to her son (and HCP) [**Name (NI) 768**] (aka
   ""[**Doctor First Name **]"").
   - At approximately 7am pt became tachycardic to 140s with BP 158/98
   while receiving a fluid bolus.

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with dementia, COPD, thyroid cancer, [**Hospital1 **] resident, presenting with
   lethargy and found to have septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and
   ARF.  Was stable and off pressors overnight.  This morning became
   hypotensive to SBP in 70s and went into Afib after levophed restarted
   and half of 1L fluid bolus received.  Currently back on pressors, but
   now phenylephrine.
   .
   # Septic shock/UTI.  Presumed urinary source with clearly positive UA
   in [**Hospital1 **] patient. Cardiac enzymes negative.  No evidence of pneumonia.
   No recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest C.diff.
   Blood cultures and urine cultures pending.
   - obtain collateral info from [**Hospital1 **] and PCP and family.
   - consider alternative sources if no improvement evaluation - bloods
   pending, CXR without clear pneumonia; abdomen seems tender though
   denies pain; could consider imaging if not improving.
   - Maintain CVPs 8-12.
   - Continue phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with Goal MAPs > 65.
   - Repeat lactate in PM.
   - Monitor central venous sats with sepsis cath or labs, consider
   inotropes if < 70.
   - Pressors: Norepi, titrate to MAP >60-65.
   - Antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with double GNR coverage
   - cefepime and cipro plus vanc for enterococcus; consider VRE coverage
   if no improvement.
   - Consider cortisol check or [**Last Name (un) **] stim.
   .
   # ARF on CKD.  Has noted CKD per [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not clear.
   Was taking K supplements at [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely this represents some degree
   of acute insufficiency.  Simple prerenal from volume depletion/poor
   flow vs. ATN from ischemia most likely.  No reason for postobstructive
   process.
   - Consider renal US if no improvment on PM labs.
   - baseline creatinine.
   - Check urine lytes.
   - Repeat lytes this PM.
   - Management of hyperkalemia as below.
   - Avoid hypotension; bolus prn to maintain CVPs.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.  Combination of ARF, K supplementation at [**Hospital1 **] in this
   setting, and [**Last Name (un) **] use.  No DKA or hyperosmolality present.
   - Monitor ECGs; Ca gluc prn K related changes.
   - Insulin and D50 for temporizing; expect total body K to improve with
   improvement in urine output.
   - Repeat lytes now.
   - Consider renal involvement if next K check not improved.
   .
   # Lethargy.  Likely due to systemic illness.  Nothing focal on exam to
   suggest focal CNS process.  Also on a number of sedating meds which may
   be affected by renal failure.
   - Consider head CT.
   - Management of septic shock as above.
   - Hold depakote, risperdone (partially renally cleared), wellbutrin,
   trazodone for now.  Check valproate level.
   .
   # ECG changes.  ST depressions in ECG in ED but this tracing most
   likely affected by poor lead positioning leading to early R wave
   transition.  Now with ST depressions more likely related to
   hypertrophy/IVCD.
   - Cycle enzymes.
   - Supportive care.
   - Consider ASA/statin if more significant elevation.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Likely related to renal failure, lactate only
   minimally elevated.
   - Continue to trend.
   - VBG for pH.
   .
   FEN: bolus prn, replete electrolytes, NPO for now.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of thyroid cancer, COPD, and dementia, who was found to be lethargic in her nursing home and was brought to the emergency department (ED). She was diagnosed with septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and acute kidney injury (AKI). She was treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and fluid boluses, and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.

The patient's condition has been stable overnight, but this morning she became hypotensive and went into atrial fibrillation (Afib) after levophed was restarted and half of 1L fluid bolus was received. She is currently back on pressors, but now on phenylephrine.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Leukocytosis (15,000 cells/μL)
* Elevated creatinine (3.9 mg/dL)
* Elevated lactate (1.7 mmol/L)
* Elevated troponin (0.9 ng/mL)
* Positive urine analysis (UA) for WBCs and bacteria
* Negative cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, troponin-T)

The patient's imaging studies show:

* A right internal jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid-right atrium
* No gross evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure (CHF)
* Atherosclerotic calcification along the aortic knob
* Bibasilar atelectasis
* Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant

The patient's medical history includes:

* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a baseline creatinine level not clear
* Thyroid cancer
* COPD
* Dementia

The patient's current medications include:

* Alprazolam
* Acetaminophen
* Unknown allergies
* Last dose of antibiotics: ciprofloxacin

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.1°C (98.8°F)
* Heart rate: 96 bpm
* Blood pressure: 95/49 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths/min
* Oxygen saturation: 94%

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Lethargic and unresponsive
* No focal neurological deficits
* No signs of pneumonia or CHF

The patient's laboratory results and imaging studies suggest that she has septic shock of urinary origin, AKI, and possible urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's medical history and current medications suggest that she may have CKD, thyroid cancer, COPD, and dementia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Further deterioration of kidney function
* Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Development of septic shock or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)
* Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Development of hyperkalemia or other electrolyte imbalances
* Development of respiratory failure or need for mechanical ventilation
* Development of cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure
* Development of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
* Development of sepsis-related encephalopathy or other neurological complications

Based on the patient's condition, the following treatment plan is recommended:

* Continue antibiotics and vasopressors as needed
* Monitor for signs of sepsis and MODS
* Monitor for signs of AKI and CKD
* Monitor for signs of hyperkalemia and electrolyte imbalances
* Monitor for signs of respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation
* Monitor for signs of cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure
* Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
* Monitor for signs of sepsis-related encephalopathy or other neurological complications
* Consider imaging studies, such as a head CT, to rule out other causes of lethargy
* Consider invasive procedures, such as a urinary catheter or central venous catheter, to improve monitoring and treatment of the patient's condition."

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with dementia, COPD, thyroid cancer, [**Hospital1 **] resident, presenting with
   lethargy and found to have septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and
   ARF.  Was stable and off pressors overnight.  This morning became
   hypotensive to SBP in 70s and went into afib after levophed restarted
   and half of 1L fluid bolus received.  Currently back on pressors, but
   now phenylephrine, and going in and out of afib.
   # UTI -  Presumed responsible for presentation with altered mental
   status, hypotension. Has tenderness to deep abdominal palpation and had
   positive UA and is a [**Hospital1 **] patient. Other items on differential are less
   likely: cardiac enzymes negative, no physical or imaging evidence of
   pneumonia, no recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest
   C.diff.
   - place a-line today for better pressure monitoring.
   - monitor CVP with RIJ and keep between [**9-14**] with fluids.
   - with CVP in range, use phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with goal MAPs >
   65.
   - repeat lactate today.
   - antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with ceftriaxone and
   cipro for GNR and vanc for enterococcus;
   - consider alternative sources if no improvement evaluation - abdomen
   seems tender though denies pain; could consider imaging if not
   improving.
   # ARF on CKD
 BUN and Cr falling with BUN=67->53->41
   Cr=3.9->3.0->2.2.  Has noted CKD per [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not
   clear.  Likely prerenal from volume depletion/poor flow and some
   component of ATN from ischemia.  Likely not postrenal because urinating
   well.
   - contact [**Name (NI) **] for baseline BUN and Cr.
   - check urine lytes to determine prerenal vs renal cause of ARF.
   - obtain pm lytes today to trend BUN and CR.
   # AFib
 Patient became hypotensive to SBP of 70s and was going in and
   out of afib on morning of [**3-28**].  Possibly caused by atrial distention
   from fluid resuscitation.
   - check with [**Hospital1 **] for history of afib
   - maintain MAPs with fluid and phenylephrine, then consider rate
   control with metoprolol if tachycardia persists.
   .
   # Lethargy and altered mental status.  Likely due to systemic illness.
   Nothing focal on exam to suggest focal CNS process.  Also on a number

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with dementia, COPD, thyroid cancer, [**Hospital1 **] resident, presenting with
   lethargy and found to have septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and
   ARF.  Was stable and off pressors overnight.  This morning became
   hypotensive to SBP in 70s and went into afib after levophed restarted
   and half of 1L fluid bolus received.  Currently back on pressors, but
   now phenylephrine, and going in and out of afib.
   # UTI -  Presumed responsible for presentation with altered mental
   status, hypotension. Has tenderness to deep abdominal palpation and had
   positive UA and is a [**Hospital1 **] patient. Other items on differential are less
   likely: cardiac enzymes negative, no physical or imaging evidence of
   pneumonia, no recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest
   C.diff.
   - place a-line today for better pressure monitoring.
   - monitor CVP with RIJ and keep between [**9-14**] with fluids.
   - with CVP in range, use phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with goal MAPs >
   65.
   - repeat lactate today.
   - antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with ceftriaxone and
   cipro for GNR and vanc for enterococcus;
   - consider alternative sources if no improvement evaluation - abdomen
   seems tender though denies pain; could consider imaging if not
   improving.
   # ARF on CKD
 BUN and Cr falling with BUN=67->53->41
   Cr=3.9->3.0->2.2.  Has noted CKD per [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not
   clear.  Likely prerenal from volume depletion/poor flow and some
   component of ATN from ischemia.  Likely not postrenal because urinating
   well.
   - contact [**Name (NI) **] for baseline BUN and Cr.
   - check urine lytes to determine prerenal vs renal cause of ARF.
   - obtain pm lytes today to trend BUN and CR.
   # AFib
 Patient became hypotensive to SBP of 70s and was going in and
   out of afib on morning of [**3-28**].  Possibly caused by atrial distention
   from fluid resuscitation.
   - check with [**Hospital1 **] for history of afib
   - maintain MAPs with fluid and phenylephrine, then consider rate
   control with metoprolol if tachycardia persists.
   .
   # Lethargy and altered mental status.  Likely due to systemic illness.
   Nothing focal on exam to suggest focal CNS process.  Also on a number
   of sedating meds which may be affected by renal failure.
   - contact [**Name (NI) **] for idea of baseline mental status.
   - management of septic shock as above.
   - hold depakote, risperdone (partially renally cleared), wellbutrin,
   trazodone for now.  Check valproate level.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now, repleting electrolytes.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of thyroid cancer, COPD, and dementia, who was found to be lethargic and hypotensive on admission to the ICU. She was diagnosed with septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient's condition has been stabilized overnight, but she has become hypotensive again and is experiencing atrial fibrillation.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **UTI:** The patient's UTI is likely the primary cause of her altered mental status, hypotension, and septic shock. If left untreated, the infection could lead to further complications such as kidney damage, sepsis, and even death.
2. **ARF:** The patient's AKI is likely due to prerenal causes such as volume depletion and poor perfusion, as well as potential renal damage from the UTI. If not managed promptly, ARF can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disorders, and even death.
3. **Atrial Fibrillation:** The patient's atrial fibrillation may be a complication of her septic shock and hypotension. If not managed promptly, atrial fibrillation can lead to further complications such as heart failure, stroke, and even death.
4. **Catheter-Related Complications:** The patient's right internal jugular venous catheter may be at risk for complications such as catheter-related bloodstream infections, catheter-associated thrombosis, and catheter-related embolism.
5. **Renal Failure:** The patient's AKI may progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not managed promptly. CKD can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disorders, and even death.
6. **Sepsis:** The patient's septic shock is at risk for progression to sepsis, which can lead to further complications such as organ failure, respiratory failure, and even death.
7. **CNS Complications:** The patient's altered mental status may be a sign of CNS complications such as cerebral edema, cerebral vasospasm, or even cerebral infarction.
8. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient's septic shock and AKI may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as ileus, gastrointestinal bleeding, and even gastrointestinal perforation.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to manage the patient's UTI with antibiotics and monitor her response closely.
2. Continue to manage the patient's AKI with fluid resuscitation and electrolyte management, and consider renal replacement therapy if necessary.
3. Manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with rate control medications and consider cardioversion if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's catheter-related complications closely and consider removing the catheter if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider dialysis if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's septic shock closely and consider transferring her to a higher level of care if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's CNS and gastrointestinal complications closely and consider consulting neurology and gastroenterology services if necessary."

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with dementia, COPD, thyroid cancer, [**Hospital1 **] resident, presenting with
   lethargy and found to have septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and
   ARF.  Was stable and off pressors overnight.  This morning became
   hypotensive to SBP in 70s and went into afib after levophed restarted
   and half of 1L fluid bolus received.  Currently back on pressors, but
   now phenylephrine, and going in and out of afib.
   # Septic shock/UTI.  Presumed urinary source with clearly positive UA
   in [**Hospital1 **] patient. Cardiac enzymes negative.  No evidence of pneumonia.
   No recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest C.diff.
   Blood cultures and urine cultures pending.
   - obtain collateral info from [**Hospital1 **] and PCP and family.
   - consider alternative sources if no improvement evaluation - bloods
   pending, CXR without clear pneumonia; abdomen seems tender though
   denies pain; could consider imaging if not improving.
   - Maintain CVPs 8-12.
   - Continue phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with Goal MAPs > 65.
   - Repeat lactate in today.
   - Monitor central venous sats with sepsis cath or labs, consider
   inotropes if < 70.
   - Antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with double GNR coverage
   - cefepime and cipro plus vanc for enterococcus;
   # ARF on CKD.  Has noted CKD per [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not clear.
   Was taking K supplements at [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely this represents some degree
   of acute insufficiency.  Simple prerenal from volume depletion/poor
   flow vs. ATN from ischemia most likely.  No reason for postobstructive
   process.
   - Consider renal US if no improvment on PM labs.
   - baseline creatinine.
   - Check urine lytes.
   - Repeat lytes this PM.
   - Management of hyperkalemia as below.
   - Avoid hypotension; bolus prn to maintain CVPs.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.  Combination of ARF, K supplementation at [**Hospital1 **] in this
   setting, and [**Last Name (un) **] use.  No DKA or hyperosmolality present.
   - Monitor ECGs; Ca gluc prn K related changes.
   - Insulin and D50 for temporizing; expect total body K to improve with
   improvement in urine output.
   - Repeat lytes now.
   - Consider renal involvement if next K check not improved.
   .
   # Lethargy.  Likely due to systemic illness.  Nothing focal on exam to
   suggest focal CNS process.  Also on a number of sedating meds which may
   be affected by renal failure.
   - Consider head CT.
   - Management of septic shock as above.
   - Hold depakote, risperdone (partially renally cleared), wellbutrin,
   trazodone for now.  Check valproate level.
   .
   # ECG changes.  ST depressions in EKG in ED but this tracing most
   likely affected by poor lead positioning leading to early R wave
   transition.  Now with ST depressions more likely related to
   hypertrophy/IVCD.
   - Cycle enzymes.
   - Supportive care.
   - Consider ASA/statin if more significant elevation.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Likely related to renal failure, lactate only
   minimally elevated.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Aline today for pH.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now, repleting electrolytes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with dementia, COPD, thyroid cancer, [**Hospital1 **] resident, presenting with
   lethargy and found to have septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and
   ARF.  Was stable and off pressors overnight.  This morning became
   hypotensive to SBP in 70s and went into afib after levophed restarted
   and half of 1L fluid bolus received.  Currently back on pressors, but
   now phenylephrine, and going in and out of afib.
   # Septic shock/UTI.  Presumed urinary source with clearly positive UA
   in [**Hospital1 **] patient. Cardiac enzymes negative.  No evidence of pneumonia.
   No recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest C.diff.
   Blood cultures and urine cultures pending.
   - obtain collateral info from [**Hospital1 **] and PCP and family.
   - consider alternative sources if no improvement evaluation - bloods
   pending, CXR without clear pneumonia; abdomen seems tender though
   denies pain; could consider imaging if not improving.
   - Maintain CVPs 8-12.
   - Continue phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with Goal MAPs > 65.
   - Repeat lactate in today.
   - Monitor central venous sats with sepsis cath or labs, consider
   inotropes if < 70.
   - Antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with double GNR coverage
   - cefepime and cipro plus vanc for enterococcus;
   # ARF on CKD.  Has noted CKD per [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not clear.
   Was taking K supplements at [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely this represents some degree
   of acute insufficiency.  Simple prerenal from volume depletion/poor
   flow vs. ATN from ischemia most likely.  No reason for postobstructive
   process.
   - Consider renal US if no improvment on PM labs.
   - baseline creatinine.
   - Check urine lytes.
   - Repeat lytes this PM.
   - Management of hyperkalemia as below.
   - Avoid hypotension; bolus prn to maintain CVPs.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.  Combination of ARF, K supplementation at [**Hospital1 **] in this
   setting, and [**Last Name (un) **] use.  No DKA or hyperosmolality present.
   - Monitor ECGs; Ca gluc prn K related changes.
   - Insulin and D50 for temporizing; expect total body K to improve with
   improvement in urine output.
   - Repeat lytes now.
   - Consider renal involvement if next K check not improved.
   .
   # Lethargy.  Likely due to systemic illness.  Nothing focal on exam to
   suggest focal CNS process.  Also on a number of sedating meds which may
   be affected by renal failure.
   - Consider head CT.
   - Management of septic shock as above.
   - Hold depakote, risperdone (partially renally cleared), wellbutrin,
   trazodone for now.  Check valproate level.
   .
   # ECG changes.  ST depressions in EKG in ED but this tracing most
   likely affected by poor lead positioning leading to early R wave
   transition.  Now with ST depressions more likely related to
   hypertrophy/IVCD.
   - Cycle enzymes.
   - Supportive care.
   - Consider ASA/statin if more significant elevation.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Likely related to renal failure, lactate only
   minimally elevated.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Aline today for pH.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now, repleting electrolytes.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

* The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of thyroid cancer, COPD, and dementia, who was found to be lethargic in her nursing home and was brought to the emergency department.
* She was diagnosed with septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and acute kidney injury (AKI).
* The patient has a Foley catheter in place, which drained purulent material, and a urinary tract infection (UTI) is suspected.
* She has been receiving antibiotics, including cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin, to cover urinary organisms.
* The patient's blood cultures and urine cultures are pending.
* She has been experiencing hyperkalemia, which is being managed with calcium gluconate and insulin.
* The patient's ECG shows ST depressions, which may be related to hypertrophy or IVCD.
* She has a metabolic acidosis, which is likely related to renal failure.
* The patient is receiving supportive care, including fluids, antibiotics, and electrolyte management.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death
* Acute kidney injury (AKI), which can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) or kidney failure
* Hyperkalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest
* Metabolic acidosis, which can lead to respiratory and cardiac complications
* UTI, which can lead to kidney damage and sepsis
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and cardiac arrest, due to electrolyte imbalances and sepsis

The patient's care plan includes:

* Monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values
* Management of septic shock with fluids, antibiotics, and pressors
* Management of AKI with fluid management and electrolyte correction
* Management of hyperkalemia with calcium gluconate and insulin
* Monitoring of ECG changes and cardiac function
* Consideration of head CT to rule out focal CNS process
* Hold of sedating medications, including depakote, risperidone, wellbutrin, and trazodone, until further evaluation

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve her clinical condition."

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with dementia, COPD, thyroid cancer, [**Hospital1 **] resident, presenting with
   lethargy and found to have septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and
   ARF.  Was stable and off pressors overnight.  This morning became
   hypotensive to SBP in 70s and went into afib after levophed restarted
   and half of 1L fluid bolus received.  Currently back on pressors, but
   now phenylephrine, and going in and out of afib.
   # UTI -  Presumed responsible for presentation with altered mental
   status, hypotension. Has tenderness to deep abdominal palpation and had
   positive UA and is a [**Hospital1 **] patient. Other items on differential are less
   likely: cardiac enzymes negative, no physical or imaging evidence of
   pneumonia, no recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest
   C.diff.
   - place a-line today for better pressure monitoring.
   - monitor CVP with RIJ and keep between [**9-14**] with fluids.
   - with CVP in range, use phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with goal MAPs >
   65.
   - repeat lactate today.
   - antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with ceftriaxone and
   cipro for GNR and vanc for enterococcus;
   - consider alternative sources if no improvement evaluation - abdomen
   seems tender though denies pain; could consider imaging if not
   improving.
   # ARF on CKD
 BUN and Cr falling with BUN=67->53->41
   Cr=3.9->3.0->2.2.  Has noted CKD per [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not
   clear.  Likely prerenal from volume depletion/poor flow and some
   component of ATN from ischemia.  Likely not postrenal because urinating
   well.
   - contact [**Name (NI) **] for baseline BUN and Cr.
   - check urine lytes to determine prerenal vs renal cause of ARF.
   - obtain pm lytes today to trend BUN and CR.
   # AFib
 Patient became hypotensive to SBP of 70s and was going in and
   out of afib on morning of [**3-28**].  Possibly caused by atrial distention
   from fluid resuscitation.
   - check with [**Hospital1 **] for history of afib
   - maintain MAPs with fluid and phenylephrine, then consider rate
   control with metoprolol if tachycardia persists.
   .
   # Lethargy and altered mental status.  Likely due to systemic illness.
   Nothing focal on exam to suggest focal CNS process.  Also on a number
   of sedating meds which may be affected by renal failure.
   - contact [**Name (NI) **] for idea of baseline mental status.
   - management of septic shock as above.
   - hold depakote, risperdone (partially renally cleared), wellbutrin,
   trazodone for now.  Check valproate level.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with dementia, COPD, thyroid cancer, [**Hospital1 **] resident, presenting with
   lethargy and found to have septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and
   ARF.  Was stable and off pressors overnight.  This morning became
   hypotensive to SBP in 70s and went into afib after levophed restarted
   and half of 1L fluid bolus received.  Currently back on pressors, but
   now phenylephrine, and going in and out of afib.
   # UTI -  Presumed responsible for presentation with altered mental
   status, hypotension. Has tenderness to deep abdominal palpation and had
   positive UA and is a [**Hospital1 **] patient. Other items on differential are less
   likely: cardiac enzymes negative, no physical or imaging evidence of
   pneumonia, no recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest
   C.diff.
   - place a-line today for better pressure monitoring.
   - monitor CVP with RIJ and keep between [**9-14**] with fluids.
   - with CVP in range, use phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with goal MAPs >
   65.
   - repeat lactate today.
   - antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with ceftriaxone and
   cipro for GNR and vanc for enterococcus;
   - consider alternative sources if no improvement evaluation - abdomen
   seems tender though denies pain; could consider imaging if not
   improving.
   # ARF on CKD
 BUN and Cr falling with BUN=67->53->41
   Cr=3.9->3.0->2.2.  Has noted CKD per [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not
   clear.  Likely prerenal from volume depletion/poor flow and some
   component of ATN from ischemia.  Likely not postrenal because urinating
   well.
   - contact [**Name (NI) **] for baseline BUN and Cr.
   - check urine lytes to determine prerenal vs renal cause of ARF.
   - obtain pm lytes today to trend BUN and CR.
   # AFib
 Patient became hypotensive to SBP of 70s and was going in and
   out of afib on morning of [**3-28**].  Possibly caused by atrial distention
   from fluid resuscitation.
   - check with [**Hospital1 **] for history of afib
   - maintain MAPs with fluid and phenylephrine, then consider rate
   control with metoprolol if tachycardia persists.
   .
   # Lethargy and altered mental status.  Likely due to systemic illness.
   Nothing focal on exam to suggest focal CNS process.  Also on a number
   of sedating meds which may be affected by renal failure.
   - contact [**Name (NI) **] for idea of baseline mental status.
   - management of septic shock as above.
   - hold depakote, risperdone (partially renally cleared), wellbutrin,
   trazodone for now.  Check valproate level.

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of thyroid cancer, COPD, and dementia, who was admitted to the ICU in septic shock likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI). She was found to be lethargic and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 65/34 mmHg. She was treated with antibiotics, fluids, and vasopressors, and her condition stabilized overnight. However, she became hypotensive again in the morning and went into atrial fibrillation (AFib).

The patient has a number of comorbidities, including chronic kidney disease (CKD) and atrial fibrillation, which may be contributing to her condition. She is also receiving a number of medications, including sedatives and antipsychotics, which may be affecting her mental status.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is likely due to a UTI, but it is possible that she may develop sepsis from other sources, such as pneumonia or intra-abdominal infection.
2. ARF: The patient's CKD and hypovolemic shock may be contributing to her acute kidney injury (AKI).
3. AFib: The patient's atrial fibrillation may be contributing to her hypotension and tachycardia.
4. UTI: The patient's UTI may not be fully treated, and she may develop complications such as pyelonephritis or septicemia.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD and sepsis may increase her risk of respiratory failure.
7. Cardiac arrest: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypotension may increase her risk of cardiac arrest.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics and fluids to treat septic shock and UTI.
2. Monitor CVP and use phenylephrine to maintain MAPs > 65.
3. Repeat lactate and electrolyte levels to monitor for signs of sepsis and AKI.
4. Consider alternative sources of infection if UTI does not improve.
5. Monitor for signs of AFib and consider rate control with metoprolol if tachycardia persists.
6. Hold sedatives and antipsychotics until further evaluation and treatment of UTI and sepsis.
7. Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and respiratory failure.
8. Consider consultation with cardiology and infectious disease specialists to further evaluate and manage the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK, SEPTIC:  Now back on pressors.  Likely urinary tract source.
   Preliminary culture growing alpha hemolytic lactobacillus (latter
   likely contaminant).   Continue current broad spectrum antibiotics. WBC
   decreasing, lactate trending down.  Still hemodynamically unstable
   albeit afib likely contributing.  Enzymes trending down, no evident
   acute cardiac component.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  Likely contributing to earlier drop in blood
   pressure.  Now in sinus rhythm, autoconverted following fluid bolus.
   Check echo.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  More awake and alert this am.
 ANEMIA:  Hct drop likely dilutional given aggressive volume
   resusitation overnight.  Need to follow serial CBCs.  Guaiac stools.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE ON CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC
   KIDNEY DISEASE):  Likely component of prerenal vs. ATN in setting of
   sepsis and hypotension.  She does have persistent eos in UA, may have
   component of interstitial nephritis.  Will review med list and stop any
   that may be potentially contributing.  Cr trending down, now 2.2.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK, SEPTIC:  Now back on pressors.  Likely urinary tract source.
   Preliminary culture growing alpha hemolytic lactobacillus (latter
   likely contaminant).   Continue current broad spectrum antibiotics. WBC
   decreasing, lactate trending down.  Still hemodynamically unstable
   albeit afib likely contributing.  Enzymes trending down, no evident
   acute cardiac component.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  Likely contributing to earlier drop in blood
   pressure.  Now in sinus rhythm, autoconverted following fluid bolus.
   Check echo.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  More awake and alert this am.
 ANEMIA:  Hct drop likely dilutional given aggressive volume
   resusitation overnight.  Need to follow serial CBCs.  Guaiac stools.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE ON CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC
   KIDNEY DISEASE):  Likely component of prerenal vs. ATN in setting of
   sepsis and hypotension.  She does have persistent eos in UA, may have
   component of interstitial nephritis.  Will review med list and stop any
   that may be potentially contributing.  Cr trending down, now 2.2.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a critically ill individual with urosepsis, currently in the ICU. The patient has a history of dementia and is unable to provide a history. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.1°C (98.8°F)
* Heart rate: 138 bpm
* Blood pressure: 73/49 mmHg (71/22-160/98 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 19 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 98%
* CVP: 12 mmHg

The patient has a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, which may be contributing to the drop in blood pressure. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm after a fluid bolus. The patient's mental status is altered, but not delirium. The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.7 g/dL, and the patient has a history of chronic kidney disease.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 10.0 K/uL
* Hct: 29.7%
* Plt: 294 K/uL
* Cr: 3.0 mg/dL (trending down)
* TropT: 0.06 ng/mL (trending down)
* Glucose: 114 mg/dL (93 mg/dL)

The patient has a culture growing alpha hemolytic lactobacillus, which is likely a contaminant. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and is being monitored for sepsis. The patient's creatinine level is trending down, and the patient's electrolytes are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
2. Cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest.
3. Neurological complications, such as increased intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, and seizures.
4. Renal failure, which can worsen the patient's underlying chronic kidney disease.
5. Electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
6. Infection-related complications, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and catheter-related bloodstream infections.
7. Nutritional deficiencies, such as protein-energy malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these complications."

   found in [**Hospital1 **] lethargic and hypoxic.  Brought to [**Hospital1 5**] and found to have
   leukocytosis and positive UA, so started on norepinephrine and
   antibiotics and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].  Now with improving mental status,
   off pressors with stable pressure, with strep viridans growing from
   urine culture.  Leukocytosis resolving to 8.3 today. Cr resolving to
   1.5 today. HCT continuing to fall to 25.3 today.

   - Arterial line placed at 1630, BP 140s so pressors d/c'd but then
   pressure dropped to 80s. CVP 2. gave IVF 1L
   - S&s oredered
   - Gave vit k 5mg x 3 days
   - BP still low when sleeping 80s, but came up when woken up. CVP 6
   after 1L so gave another slowly
   - Curbside consult with ID: case would be a good ID consult for this
   morning.  Several possible sources of strep viridans that they could
   look into.

   Imaging: Echo from [**8-25**]
   Conclusions
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Septic shock
 UTI presumed responsible for presentation with altered
   mental status, hypotension, leukocytosis.  Urine growing strep
   viridans. Pt now with stable pressures per arterial line and off
   pressors. Echo showed no strep viridans vegs.
   - follow blood cultures
   - ID consult today because strep viridans is an unusual UTI bug.
   - discontinue ciprofloxacin and vanc.  Continue ceftriaxone.
   - monitor CVP with RIJ and keep between [**9-14**] with fluids.
   - with CVP in range, use phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with goal MAPs >
   65.
   - discontinue a line today
   # ARF on CKD
 BUN and Cr falling with BUN=23 Cr=1.5  Has noted CKD per
   [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not clear.  Etiology of ARF likely prerenal
   from volume depletion/poor flow and some component of ATN from
   ischemia.  Likely not postrenal because urinating well.
   - only need daily lytes to trend BUN and CR, since we are not using
   diuresis.
   # AFib
 On [**3-28**] patient became hypotensive to SBP of 70s and was going
   in and out of afib on morning of [**3-28**].  Possibly caused by atrial
   distention from fluid resuscitation.  Pt has been in sinus since.  No
   history of Afib from nursing home notes.
   - maintain MAPs with fluid and phenylephrine, then consider rate
   control with metoprolol if tachycardia persists.
   - restart home nefedipine given good blood pressure.
   # Lethargy and altered mental status.  Patient A&Ox3 today with mental
   status remarkably improved from presentation. Likely due to systemic
   illness.  Nothing focal on exam to suggest focal CNS process.  Pt was
   also on a number of sedating meds which may be affected by renal
   failure.
   - management of septic shock as above.
   - can restart depakote, risperdone, wellbutrin, trazodone.
   # Anemia
 pt having HCT drop since admission.  Today 25.3 from 29.5
   yesterday.  No signs or suspicion of bleeding.  Guiac negative
   yesterday.
   - continue to trend with afternoon HCT
   # COPD
 pt has history of COPD and is wheezing on exam
   - restart home tiotropium (spiriva) and ipratropium/albuterol
   (combivent)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 70F with dementia, bipolar, depression, COPD, CAD
   found in [**Hospital1 **] lethargic and hypoxic.  Brought to [**Hospital1 5**] and found to have
   leukocytosis and positive UA, so started on norepinephrine and
   antibiotics and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].  Now with improving mental status,
   off pressors with stable pressure, with strep viridans growing from
   urine culture.  Leukocytosis resolving to 8.3 today. Cr resolving to
   1.5 today. HCT continuing to fall to 25.3 today.

 ARTERIAL LINE - START [**2113-3-28**] 04:14 PM
   [**3-28**]
   - Arterial line placed at 1630, BP 140s so pressors d/c'd but then
   pressure dropped to 80s. CVP 2. gave IVF 1L
   - S&s oredered
   - Gave vit k 5mg x 3 days
   - BP still low when sleeping 80s, but came up when woken up. CVP 6
   after 1L so gave another slowly
   - Curbside consult with ID: case would be a good ID consult for this
   morning.  Several possible sources of strep viridans that they could
   look into.

   Conclusions
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Septic shock
 UTI presumed responsible for presentation with altered
   mental status, hypotension, leukocytosis.  Urine growing strep
   viridans. Pt now with stable pressures per arterial line and off
   pressors. Echo showed no strep viridans vegs.
   - follow blood cultures
   - ID consult today because strep viridans is an unusual UTI bug.
   - discontinue ciprofloxacin and vanc.  Continue ceftriaxone.
   - monitor CVP with RIJ and keep between [**9-14**] with fluids.
   - with CVP in range, use phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with goal MAPs >
   65.
   - discontinue a line today
   # ARF on CKD
 BUN and Cr falling with BUN=23 Cr=1.5  Has noted CKD per
   [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not clear.  Etiology of ARF likely prerenal
   from volume depletion/poor flow and some component of ATN from
   ischemia.  Likely not postrenal because urinating well.
   - only need daily lytes to trend BUN and CR, since we are not using
   diuresis.
   # AFib
 On [**3-28**] patient became hypotensive to SBP of 70s and was going
   in and out of afib on morning of [**3-28**].  Possibly caused by atrial
   distention from fluid resuscitation.  Pt has been in sinus since.  No
   history of Afib from nursing home notes.
   - maintain MAPs with fluid and phenylephrine, then consider rate
   control with metoprolol if tachycardia persists.
   - restart home nefedipine given good blood pressure.
   # Lethargy and altered mental status.  Patient A&Ox3 today with mental
   status remarkably improved from presentation. Likely due to systemic
   illness.  Nothing focal on exam to suggest focal CNS process.  Pt was
   also on a number of sedating meds which may be affected by renal
   failure.
   - management of septic shock as above.
   - can restart depakote, risperdone, wellbutrin, trazodone.
   # Anemia
 pt having HCT drop since admission.  Today 25.3 from 29.5
   yesterday.  No signs or suspicion of bleeding.  Guiac negative
   yesterday.
   - continue to trend with afternoon HCT
   # COPD
 pt has history of COPD and is wheezing on exam
   - restart home tiotropium (spiriva) and ipratropium/albuterol
   (combivent)

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of dementia, bipolar disorder, depression, COPD, and CAD, who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock and altered mental status.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T: 36.9°C, HR: 103 bpm, BP: 85/63 mmHg, RR: 18 breaths/min, SpO2: 96%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Arterial line in place, CVP: 7 mmHg, MAP: 65 mmHg
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula with O2 delivery
* Laboratory results:
	+ Blood cultures: Pending
	+ Urine culture: Growing Streptococcus viridans
	+ Blood chemistry: Elevated BUN and Cr, normal electrolytes
	+ Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L
* Imaging: Transthoracic echo: Mildly dilated left atrium, normal left ventricular function, mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
* Microbiology: MRSA screen pending, Blood culture pending

The patient's diagnosis is septic shock due to presumed urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Streptococcus viridans. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics and is off pressors. The patient's mental status has improved remarkably since presentation, and the patient is now awake and alert.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Renal failure: The patient's BUN and Cr levels are elevated, and the patient has a history of CKD. The patient's electrolytes are normal, but the patient's HCT is dropping, which may indicate bleeding or other underlying conditions.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of AFib, and the patient's heart rate is currently 103 bpm. The patient's MAP is 65 mmHg, which may be indicative of hypotension.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and is wheezing on exam. The patient's oxygen saturation is 96%, but the patient may require further respiratory support.
4. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's lactic acid level is elevated, which may indicate sepsis-related organ dysfunction.
5. Bleeding: The patient's HCT is dropping, which may indicate bleeding or other underlying conditions.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing antibiotics and monitoring blood cultures
* ID consult today to discuss unusual UTI bug
* Discontinuing ciprofloxacin and vanc, continuing ceftriaxone
* Monitoring CVP with RIJ and keeping between 9-14 mmHg with fluids
* Using phenylephrine with goal MAPs > 65
* Discontinuing arterial line today
* Restarting home medications, including nefedipine and beta-blockers
* Monitoring anemia and electrolytes
* Continuing COPD management with inhalers and oxygen therapy as needed."

   Conclusions
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 70F with dementia, bipolar, depression, COPD, CAD
   found in [**Hospital1 **] lethargic and hypoxic.  Brought to [**Hospital1 5**] and found to have
   leukocytosis and positive UA, so started on norepinephrine and
   antibiotics and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].  Now with improving mental status,
   off pressors with stable pressure, with strep viridans growing from
   urine culture.  Leukocytosis resolving to 8.3 today. Cr resolving to
   1.5 today. HCT continuing to fall to 25.3 today.
   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2113-3-28**] 10:42 AM

 ARTERIAL LINE - START [**2113-3-28**] 04:14 PM
   [**3-28**]
   - Arterial line placed at 1630, BP 140s so pressors d/c'd but then
   pressure dropped to 80s. CVP 2. gave IVF 1L
   - S&s oredered
   - Gave vit k 5mg x 3 days
   - BP still low when sleeping 80s, but came up when woken up. CVP 6
   after 1L so gave another slowly
   - Curbside consult with ID: case would be a good ID consult for this
   morning.  Several possible sources of strep viridans that they could
   look into.

   Conclusions
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a complex medical history, including dementia, bipolar disorder, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was found lethargic and hypoxic at [**Hospital1**] and was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] where he was started on norepinephrine and antibiotics. He has since shown improvement in his mental status and has been weaned off pressors.

The patient's current vital signs include:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.5°F)
* Heart rate: 103 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 85/63 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Arterial blood gases: pH 7.41, pCO2 31 mmHg, pO2 74 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.3 K/uL (normal range: 4.5-11.0 K/uL)
* Hematocrit: 25.3% (normal range: 37-52%)
* Platelet count: 272 K/uL (normal range: 150-450 K/uL)
* Creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Troponin-T: 0.05 ng/mL (normal range: <0.1 ng/mL)
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L (normal range: 0.5-2.0 mmol/L)

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE): The left atrium is mildly dilated, and the left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and regional/global systolic function are normal. There is no ventricular septal defect, and the aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened but there is no aortic stenosis or regurgitation.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Impaired skin integrity
* Tachycardia
* Septic shock
* Altered mental status
* Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
* Chronic renal failure

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* ICU care
* Nutrition support
* Glycemic control
* Lines: multi-lumen, 18-gauge, and arterial line
* Prophylaxis: DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* Monitoring: frequent vital sign checks, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock
* Acute kidney injury
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Bleeding complications
* Infection-related complications

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to prevent and manage potential complications."

   found in [**Hospital1 **] lethargic and hypoxic.  Brought to [**Hospital1 5**] and found to have
   leukocytosis and positive UA, so started on norepinephrine and
   antibiotics and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].  Now with improving mental status,
   off pressors with stable pressure, with strep viridans growing from
   urine culture.  Leukocytosis resolving to 8.3 today. Cr resolving to
   1.5 today. HCT continuing to fall to 25.3 today.

   - Arterial line placed at 1630, BP 140s so pressors d/c'd but then
   pressure dropped to 80s. CVP 2. gave IVF 1L
   - S&s oredered
   - Gave vit k 5mg x 3 days
   - BP still low when sleeping 80s, but came up when woken up. CVP 6
   after 1L so gave another slowly
   - Curbside consult with ID: case would be a good ID consult for this
   morning.  Several possible sources of strep viridans that they could
   look into.

   Conclusions
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 70F with dementia, bipolar, depression, COPD, CAD
   found in [**Hospital1 **] lethargic and hypoxic.  Brought to [**Hospital1 5**] and found to have
   leukocytosis and positive UA, so started on norepinephrine and
   antibiotics and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].  Now with improving mental status,
   off pressors with stable pressure, with strep viridans growing from
   urine culture.  Leukocytosis resolving to 8.3 today. Cr resolving to
   1.5 today. HCT continuing to fall to 25.3 today.
   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2113-3-28**] 10:42 AM
 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2113-3-28**] 02:45 PM
 ARTERIAL LINE - START [**2113-3-28**] 04:14 PM
   [**3-28**]
   - Arterial line placed at 1630, BP 140s so pressors d/c'd but then
   pressure dropped to 80s. CVP 2. gave IVF 1L
   - S&s oredered
   - Gave vit k 5mg x 3 days
   - BP still low when sleeping 80s, but came up when woken up. CVP 6
   after 1L so gave another slowly
   - Curbside consult with ID: case would be a good ID consult for this
   morning.  Several possible sources of strep viridans that they could
   look into.

   Conclusions
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a complex medical history, including dementia, bipolar disorder, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the hospital in a lethargic state with hypoxia and was found to have leukocytosis and a positive urine culture. He was started on norepinephrine and antibiotics and transferred to the ICU.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.9°C, heart rate 103 bpm, blood pressure 85/63 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 96%.
* Laboratory results: White blood cell count 8.3 K/uL, hemoglobin 8.4 g/dL, creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 23 mg/dL, sodium 144 mmol/L, potassium 3.1 mmol/L, chloride 117 mmol/L, bicarbonate 19 mmol/L, anion gap 11.
* Imaging studies: Transthoracic echo revealed mild dilation of the left atrium, normal left ventricular wall thickness, and trivial mitral regurgitation.
* Microbiology: Urine culture grew Streptococcus viridans.

Potential medical complications that may arise based on the patient's current status include:

* Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis, positive urine culture, and hypotension suggest the possibility of sepsis.
* Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease and elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels put him at risk for acute kidney injury.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD and hypoxia may lead to respiratory failure.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's CAD and hypotension may lead to cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
* Neurological complications: The patient's dementia and altered mental status may put him at risk for neurological complications such as seizures or stroke.

The patient's plan of care should focus on managing his sepsis, renal failure, respiratory failure, cardiac complications, and neurological complications. This may involve adjusting his antibiotics, fluid management, and oxygen therapy, as well as closely monitoring his vital signs and laboratory results."

   found in [**Hospital1 **] lethargic and hypoxic.  Brought to [**Hospital1 5**] and found to have
   leukocytosis and positive UA, so started on norepinephrine and
   antibiotics and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].  Now with improving mental status,
   off pressors with stable pressure, with strep viridans growing from
   urine culture.  Leukocytosis resolving to 8.3 today. Cr resolving to
   1.5 today. HCT continuing to fall to 25.3 today.

   - Arterial line placed at 1630, BP 140s so pressors d/c'd but then
   pressure dropped to 80s. CVP 2. gave IVF 1L
   - S&s oredered
   - Gave vit k 5mg x 3 days
   - BP still low when sleeping 80s, but came up when woken up. CVP 6
   after 1L so gave another slowly
   - Curbside consult with ID: case would be a good ID consult for this
   morning.  Several possible sources of strep viridans that they could
   look into.

   Imaging: Echo from [**8-25**]
   Conclusions
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Septic shock
 UTI presumed responsible for presentation with altered
   mental status, hypotension, leukocytosis.  Urine growing strep
   viridans. Other items on differential are less likely: cardiac enzymes
   and echo negative, no physical or imaging evidence of pneumonia, no
   recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest C.diff.
   Pt now with stable pressures per arterial line and off pressors.
   - monitor CVP with RIJ and keep between [**9-14**] with fluids.
   - with CVP in range, use phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with goal MAPs >
   65.
   - repeat lactate today.
   - antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with ceftriaxone and
   cipro for GNR and vanc for enterococcus;
   # ARF on CKD
 BUN and Cr falling with BUN=23 Cr=1.5  Has noted CKD per
   [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not clear.  Etiology of ARF likely prerenal
   from volume depletion/poor flow and some component of ATN from
   ischemia.  Likely not postrenal because urinating well.
   - obtain pm lytes today to trend BUN and CR.
   # AFib
 On [**3-28**] patient became hypotensive to SBP of 70s and was going
   in and out of afib on morning of [**3-28**].  Possibly caused by atrial
   distention from fluid resuscitation.  Pt has been in sinus since.  No
   history of Afib from nursing home notes.
   - maintain MAPs with fluid and phenylephrine, then consider rate
   control with metoprolol if tachycardia persists.
   # Lethargy and altered mental status.  Patient A&Ox3 today with mental
   status remarkably improved from presentation. Likely due to systemic
   illness.  Nothing focal on exam to suggest focal CNS process.  Pt was
   also on a number of sedating meds which may be affected by renal
   failure.
   - management of septic shock as above.
   - continue to hold depakote, risperdone (partially renally cleared),
   wellbutrin, trazodone for now.  Check valproate level.
   # Anemia
 pt having HCT drop since admission.  Today 25.3 from 29.5
   yesterday.  No signs or suspicion of bleeding.  Guiac negative
   yesterday.
   - continue to trend.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 70F with dementia, bipolar, depression, COPD, CAD
   found in [**Hospital1 **] lethargic and hypoxic.  Brought to [**Hospital1 5**] and found to have
   leukocytosis and positive UA, so started on norepinephrine and
   antibiotics and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].  Now with improving mental status,
   off pressors with stable pressure, with strep viridans growing from
   urine culture.  Leukocytosis resolving to 8.3 today. Cr resolving to
   1.5 today. HCT continuing to fall to 25.3 today.

 ARTERIAL LINE - START [**2113-3-28**] 04:14 PM
   [**3-28**]
   - Arterial line placed at 1630, BP 140s so pressors d/c'd but then
   pressure dropped to 80s. CVP 2. gave IVF 1L
   - S&s oredered
   - Gave vit k 5mg x 3 days
   - BP still low when sleeping 80s, but came up when woken up. CVP 6
   after 1L so gave another slowly
   - Curbside consult with ID: case would be a good ID consult for this
   morning.  Several possible sources of strep viridans that they could
   look into.

   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Septic shock
 UTI presumed responsible for presentation with altered
   mental status, hypotension, leukocytosis.  Urine growing strep
   viridans. Other items on differential are less likely: cardiac enzymes
   and echo negative, no physical or imaging evidence of pneumonia, no
   recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest C.diff.
   Pt now with stable pressures per arterial line and off pressors.
   - monitor CVP with RIJ and keep between [**9-14**] with fluids.
   - with CVP in range, use phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with goal MAPs >
   65.
   - repeat lactate today.
   - antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with ceftriaxone and
   cipro for GNR and vanc for enterococcus;
   # ARF on CKD
 BUN and Cr falling with BUN=23 Cr=1.5  Has noted CKD per
   [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not clear.  Etiology of ARF likely prerenal
   from volume depletion/poor flow and some component of ATN from
   ischemia.  Likely not postrenal because urinating well.
   - obtain pm lytes today to trend BUN and CR.
   # AFib
 On [**3-28**] patient became hypotensive to SBP of 70s and was going
   in and out of afib on morning of [**3-28**].  Possibly caused by atrial
   distention from fluid resuscitation.  Pt has been in sinus since.  No
   history of Afib from nursing home notes.
   - maintain MAPs with fluid and phenylephrine, then consider rate
   control with metoprolol if tachycardia persists.
   # Lethargy and altered mental status.  Patient A&Ox3 today with mental
   status remarkably improved from presentation. Likely due to systemic
   illness.  Nothing focal on exam to suggest focal CNS process.  Pt was
   also on a number of sedating meds which may be affected by renal
   failure.
   - management of septic shock as above.
   - continue to hold depakote, risperdone (partially renally cleared),
   wellbutrin, trazodone for now.  Check valproate level.
   # Anemia
 pt having HCT drop since admission.  Today 25.3 from 29.5
   yesterday.  No signs or suspicion of bleeding.  Guiac negative
   yesterday.
   - continue to trend.

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with dementia, bipolar disorder, depression, COPD, and CAD who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock and altered mental status. He was found to have leukocytosis, positive urine culture for streptococcus viridans, and was treated with norepinephrine and antibiotics. His mental status has improved, and he is now off pressors with stable blood pressure. He has ARF, anemia, and AFib. His electrolyte levels are abnormal, and he has a history of CKD. He is being treated with ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin for his septic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock may worsen if his blood pressure drops further or if he develops further organ dysfunction.
2. ARF: The patient's ARF may progress if he does not receive adequate fluid resuscitation or if his kidney function does not improve.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if he continues to lose blood or if his bone marrow function does not improve.
4. AFib: The patient's AFib may worsen if his heart rate does not stabilize or if he develops further cardiac dysfunction.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's CAD and AFib put him at risk for cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's COPD and ARF put him at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's septic shock and ARF put him at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding or perforation.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and AFib put him at risk for neurological complications such as seizures or stroke.
9. Infection: The patient's septic shock and ARF put him at risk for further infections, including urinary tract infections, pneumonia, or bloodstream infections.
10. Renal complications: The patient's ARF and CKD put him at risk for further renal complications such as chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and electrolyte levels closely.
2. Continue to treat the patient's septic shock with antibiotics and fluids.
3. Monitor the patient's kidney function closely and consider dialysis if necessary.
4. Continue to treat the patient's anemia with blood transfusions if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's heart rate and rhythm closely and consider cardioversion if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider mechanical ventilation if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely and consider prophylactic antibiotics if necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and consider prophylactic anticonvulsants if necessary.
9. Consider further imaging studies such as echocardiogram or CT scan to evaluate the patient's cardiac and renal function.
10. Consider further laboratory studies such as troponin or BNP to evaluate the patient's cardiac function."

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK, SEPTIC VS. HYPOVOLEMIA:   Off pressors since yesterday
   afternoon, hypotensive episode last night with low CVP, responsive to
   IVF challenge.  Urine growing stres viridans.  Blood cultures no growth
   to date.  WBC normal.  TTE did not show vegetations.  ID service to
   consult given this is an unusual bacteria in this setting.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Improved with treatment of
   infection.
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE):  Secondary to sepsis, hypotension, probable component of
   ATN.  Cr continues to trend down..  Good urine output.
 ANEMIA:  Hct down to 25, likely dilutional. She has been guaiac

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hypotension and urosepsis. The patient's condition is complicated by septic shock, altered mental status, chronic renal failure, and anemia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (PLT)
* Elevated creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, indicating chronic kidney disease
* Anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 8.4 g/dL
* Elevated troponin-T levels, indicating possible cardiac injury
* Normal cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, and Troponin-T)
* Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) with elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (98.9°F)
* Heart rate: 101 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 107/82 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Central venous pressure (CVP): 11 mmHg

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Normal skin and neurologic examination
* Abnormal cardiovascular examination with hypotension and tachycardia
* Abnormal respiratory examination with tachypnea
* Abnormal abdominal examination with tenderness and guarding

The patient's medical history is significant for chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She has a history of sepsis and has been treated with antibiotics.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction (e.g., acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and cardiac dysfunction)
* Chronic kidney disease progression
* Anemia and its associated complications (e.g., fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased exercise tolerance)
* Cardiac dysfunction and its associated complications (e.g., heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest)
* Neurological complications (e.g., septic encephalopathy, seizures, and coma)
* Gastrointestinal complications (e.g., necrotizing enterocolitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and perforation)

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring her vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings closely. The patient should be treated with antibiotics and supportive care, including fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, and mechanical ventilation if necessary."
