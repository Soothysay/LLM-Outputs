You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an unresponsive individual with a complex medical history, currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and respiratory support. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 100/54 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indicating potential infection or tissue damage. The patient's renal function is compromised, with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 18 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC and LDH levels may indicate the presence of an infection, which could lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine and BUN levels suggest potential kidney damage, which could lead to AKI, a condition characterized by impaired kidney function.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's need for mechanical ventilation and elevated respiratory rate (RR) may indicate respiratory failure, which could lead to further complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and melena may indicate ongoing bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and further complications.
5. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature of 36.4°C may indicate hypothermia, which could lead to further complications, such as cardiovascular instability and respiratory failure.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin-T level may indicate cardiac injury or infarction, which could lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's unresponsive state may indicate neurological damage or injury, which could lead to further complications, such as seizures or increased intracranial pressure."

 HYPOTHERMIA
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology although leading diagnosis is
   likely post-ictal with slow metabolism or 2mg ativan this morning.
   Other etiologies could be worsening hepatic encephalopathy, although
   had 7 BMs yesterday and was taking her lactulose.  Missed her PM dose
   because of excessive BMs and then did not take anything by mouth this
   morning.  Could be secondary to infection.  Could be status
   epilecticus.  Could be from hyponatremia, but did not have a swift fall
   in Na today.
   - continue to monitor closely for respiratory depression
   - avoid flumazenil because it lowers seizure threshold
   - d/c cipro bc it also lower seizure threshold
   - follow up neuro recs
   - follow up final read CT head
   - consider MRI if stable for transport
   - if more awake, trial of lactulose, if still somnulent would consider
   intubation and NGT for lactulose trial
   - infectious workup with blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis later
   .
   # Respiratory Status: is protecting airway right now but is tenuous
   with poor gag reflex and depressed respiratory rate to 8.  She is
   satting well on 3L NC right now.
   - monitor for now, if mental status worsening, consider intubation
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue gabapentin, but hold for mental status
   - seizure precautions
   - EEG
   - MRI when stable
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected
   - started vanco [**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   .
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant
   - lactulose when PO access
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabalized.
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider ceftriaxone for ppx
   - consider diagnostic paracentesisi.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a complex medical history, including Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and a recent history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and seizures.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypothermia, and respiratory compromise. The patient's mental status is unclear, with a possible etiology including post-ictal state, worsening hepatic encephalopathy, infection, or status epilepticus.

The patient's respiratory status is also compromised, with a depressed respiratory rate and poor gag reflex. She is currently being monitored closely, and intubation may be considered if her mental status worsens.

The patient has a history of seizures, which may be secondary to liver failure or an underlying organic seizure disorder. She is being treated with gabapentin and is on seizure precautions.

The patient's hypothermia is possibly infected, and she has been started on vancomycin empirically. She also has new hyponatremia, which may be secondary to diuretic use and possible syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).

The patient's liver function is also compromised, with an elevated INR and worsening bilirubinemia. She has been evaluated for liver transplant and is being treated with lactulose to manage her encephalopathy.

The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely secondary to liver disease, and she is being monitored closely for bleeding. She has also been treated for suspected sepsis-induced thrombocytopenia.

The patient's anemia is slowly trending down, and she will continue to be monitored and transfused if her hemoglobin level falls below 25.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's history of SBP and current altered mental status make her at risk for developing sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's depressed respiratory rate and poor gag reflex make her at risk for respiratory failure.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver function is compromised, and she is at risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures, and her current condition may exacerbate this risk.
5. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and anemia make her at risk for bleeding.
6. Infection: The patient's current condition and medical history make her at risk for developing infections.
7. Liver failure: The patient's liver function is compromised, and she may be at risk for developing liver failure.
8. Hyponatremia: The patient's current hyponatremia may worsen if not managed properly.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient closely and adjusting her treatment plan as necessary to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 .H/O GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
 HYPOTHERMIA
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports.
   - IVF boluses prn, continue levophed for pressure support.  Add
   vasopressin as needed.
   - check CVP, check ScV02
   .
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology although leading diagnosis is
   likely post-ictal with slow metabolism or 2mg ativan this morning.
   Other etiologies could be worsening hepatic encephalopathy, although
   had 7 BMs yesterday and was taking her lactulose.  Missed her PM dose
   because of excessive BMs and then did not take anything by mouth this
   morning.  Could be secondary to infection.  Could be status
   epilecticus.  Could be from hyponatremia, but did not have a swift fall
   in Na today.
   - continue to monitor closely for respiratory depression
   - d/c cipro bc it also lower seizure threshold
   - follow up neuro recs
   - follow up final read CT head
   - consider MRI if stable for transport
   - if more awake, trial of lactulose, if still somnulent would consider
   intubation and NGT for lactulose trial
   - infectious workup with blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis later
   - Avoid ativan as it will be cleared/metabolized slowly
   .
   # Respiratory Status: is protecting airway right now but is tenuous
   with poor gag reflex and depressed respiratory rate to 8.  She is
   satting well on 3L NC right now.
   - monitor for now, if mental status worsening, intubated
   - consider bronchoscopy today
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue gabapentin, but hold for mental status
   - seizure precautions
   - EEG
   - MRI when stable
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected
   - started vanco [**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   .
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant
   - lactulose when PO access
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabalized.
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider ceftriaxone for ppx
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds.
   .
   # ARF: resolved, was thought most likely secondary to hepatorenal
   syndrome initially.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down, unclear why; will continue to monitor
   and transfuse for hct <25.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.
   .
   # FEN: albumin for SBP / replete lytes prn / NPO for now, consider
   nutrition consult for TF
   # PPX: PPI (now changed to IV), pneumoboots given thrombocytopenia,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports.
   - IVF boluses prn, continue levophed for pressure support.  Add
   vasopressin as needed.
   - check CVP, check ScV02
   .
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology although leading diagnosis is
   likely post-ictal with slow metabolism or 2mg ativan this morning.
   Other etiologies could be worsening hepatic encephalopathy, although
   had 7 BMs yesterday and was taking her lactulose.  Missed her PM dose
   because of excessive BMs and then did not take anything by mouth this
   morning.  Could be secondary to infection.  Could be status
   epilecticus.  Could be from hyponatremia, but did not have a swift fall
   in Na today. Head CT with no evidence for acute process. Possibly
   secondary to bacteremia as below.
   - continue to monitor closely for respiratory depression
   - d/c cipro bc it also lower seizure threshold
   - follow up neuro recs
   - consider MRI if stable for transport
   - if more awake, trial of lactulose, if still somnulent would consider
   intubation and NGT for lactulose trial
   - infectious workup with blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis later
   - Avoid ativan as it will be cleared/metabolized slowly
   .
   # Respiratory Status: Intubated with concern over airway protection.
   - Currently undergoing spontaneous breathing trial
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**].

   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue gabapentin, but hold for mental status
   - seizure precautions
   - EEG
   - MRI when stable
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected
   - started vanco [**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current MELD =
   31.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide
   .
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD = 31 today.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant
   - lactulose when PO access
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabalized.
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports.
   - IVF boluses prn, continue levophed for pressure support.  Add
   vasopressin as needed.
   - check CVP, check ScV02
   .
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology although leading diagnosis is
   likely post-ictal with slow metabolism or 2mg ativan this morning.
   Other etiologies could be worsening hepatic encephalopathy, although
   had 7 BMs yesterday and was taking her lactulose.  Missed her PM dose
   because of excessive BMs and then did not take anything by mouth this
   morning.  Could be secondary to infection.  Could be status
   epilecticus.  Could be from hyponatremia, but did not have a swift fall
   in Na today. Head CT with no evidence for acute process. Possibly
   secondary to bacteremia as below.
   - continue to monitor closely for respiratory depression
   - d/c cipro bc it also lower seizure threshold
   - follow up neuro recs
   - consider MRI if stable for transport
   - if more awake, trial of lactulose, if still somnulent would consider
   intubation and NGT for lactulose trial
   - infectious workup with blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis later
   - Avoid ativan as it will be cleared/metabolized slowly
   .
   # Respiratory Status: Intubated with concern over airway protection.
   - Currently undergoing spontaneous breathing trial
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**].
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue gabapentin, but hold for mental status
   - seizure precautions
   - EEG
   - MRI when stable
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected
   - started vanco [**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current MELD =
   31.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide
   .
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD = 31 today.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant
   - lactulose when PO access
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabalized.
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider ceftriaxone for ppx
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds.
   .
   # ARF: resolved, was thought most likely secondary to hepatorenal
   syndrome initially.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down, unclear why; will continue to monitor
   and transfuse for hct <25.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.
   .
   # FEN: albumin for SBP / replete lytes prn / NPO for now, consider

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, Hepato-Renal Syndrome, HIV, and recent Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP) and seizures. She is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with altered mental status, respiratory compromise, and shock.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.6°C, HR 89 bpm, BP 100/56 mmHg, RR 13 insp/min, SpO2 96%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: intravascularly dry, with a CVP of unknown value
* Fluid balance: 3,576 mL total input, 2,972 mL IVF, 953 mL PO, 410 mL urine output
* Respiratory support: intubated, with a spontaneous breathing trial underway
* Laboratory results:
	+ Renal function: creatinine 1.4 mg/dL, INR 2.6
	+ Liver function: bilirubinemia 17 mg/dL, INR 1.8
	+ Electrolytes: Na 135 mg/dL, K 4.3 mEq/L, Cl 101 mEq/L
	+ Blood cultures: positive for GPC in clusters
	+ Urinalysis: pending
* Medications:
	+ Vasopressin 2.4 units/hour
	+ Levophed for pressure support
	+ Vancomycin for empiric treatment of infection
	+ Meropenem for treatment of ESBL UTI
	+ Gabapentin for seizure prophylaxis
	+ Lactulose for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy
* Assessment and plan:
	+ Shock: intravascularly dry, with a CVP of unknown value; IVF boluses and vasopressin as needed
	+ Altered mental status: unclear etiology, with possible causes including post-ictal state, worsening hepatic encephalopathy, infection, or status epilepticus; continue to monitor closely and consider MRI if stable for transport
	+ Respiratory status: intubated with concern over airway protection; continue spontaneous breathing trial
	+ Infection: positive blood culture, with empiric treatment with vancomycin; consider diagnostic paracentesis and follow-up speciation/sensitivities
	+ Seizures: unclear etiology, with possible causes including liver failure, underlying organic seizure disorder, or medication side effects; continue gabapentin and consider EEG and MRI when stable
	+ Hyponatremia: possible cause secondary to diuretic use and possible SIADH; continue to hold diuretics and consider fluid restriction and albumin administration
	+ Hepatitis C cirrhosis: underlying condition with worsening liver function and MELD score of 31; continue to trend LFTs and coags, and consider liver transplant evaluation

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of shock and organ dysfunction
* Development of septic shock and multi-organ failure
* Progression of hepatic encephalopathy and worsening of mental status
* Respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation
* Infection and sepsis, including possible bacteremia and pneumonia
* Seizure recurrence and status epilepticus
* Hyponatremia and sodium imbalance
* Cholestatic liver disease and worsening bilirubinemia
* Gastrointestinal bleeding and ascites
* Anemia and thrombocytopenia, with possible bleeding complications
* Need for further diagnostic studies, including MRI and EEG, to determine underlying causes of altered mental status and seizures."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports.
   - IVF boluses prn, continue levophed for pressure support.  Add
   vasopressin as needed.
   - check CVP, check ScV02
   .
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology although leading diagnosis is
   likely post-ictal with slow metabolism or 2mg ativan this morning.
   Other etiologies could be worsening hepatic encephalopathy, although
   had 7 BMs yesterday and was taking her lactulose.  Missed her PM dose
   because of excessive BMs and then did not take anything by mouth this
   morning.  Could be secondary to infection.  Could be status
   epilecticus.  Could be from hyponatremia, but did not have a swift fall
   in Na today. Head CT with no evidence for acute process.
   - continue to monitor closely for respiratory depression
   - d/c cipro bc it also lower seizure threshold
   - follow up neuro recs
   - consider MRI if stable for transport
   - if more awake, trial of lactulose, if still somnulent would consider
   intubation and NGT for lactulose trial
   - infectious workup with blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis later
   - Avoid ativan as it will be cleared/metabolized slowly
   .
   # Respiratory Status: Intubated with concern over airway protection.
   - Currently undergoing spontaneous breathing trial
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue gabapentin, but hold for mental status
   - seizure precautions
   - EEG
   - MRI when stable
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected
   - started vanco [**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current MELD =
   31.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide
   .
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD = 31 today.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant
   - lactulose when PO access
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabalized.
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider ceftriaxone for ppx
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds.
   .
   # ARF: resolved, was thought most likely secondary to hepatorenal
   syndrome initially.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a complex medical history, including hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and a recent history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and seizures. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Altered mental status: unclear etiology, possibly post-ictal, worsening hepatic encephalopathy, or secondary to infection.
* Shock: intravascularly dry, with a CVP of 10 cmH2O and a ScVO2 of 60%.
* Respiratory status: intubated, with concern over airway protection, and undergoing spontaneous breathing trial.
* Seizures: unclear etiology, possibly secondary to liver failure or an underlying organic seizure disorder.
* Hyponatremia: new onset, thought to be secondary to diuretic use and possible SIADH, with a FeNa of <1%.
* Hepatitis C cirrhosis: worsening bilirubinemia, with an INR of 1.8 and a MELD score of 31.
* Cholestasis: possibly due to worsening liver failure or keppra side effect.
* Ascites/LE Edema: stable, with a tense belly and mild peripheral edema.
* HIV: stable, with a last CD4 count in the 600s.
* ARF: resolved, previously thought to be secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: due to worsening lung disease or pneumonia.
* Seizure disorder: possibly secondary to liver failure or an underlying organic seizure disorder.
* Hepatic encephalopathy: worsening cognitive function and altered mental status.
* Infection: secondary to SBP, pneumonia, or other sources.
* Hyponatremia: worsening electrolyte imbalance and possible cerebral edema.
* Cholestasis: worsening liver function and possible bilirubinemia.
* Ascites/LE Edema: worsening fluid overload and possible respiratory compromise.
* HIV-related complications: worsening immune function and possible opportunistic infections.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* IVF boluses as needed to support blood pressure.
* Levophed for pressure support.
* Vasopressin as needed.
* CVP monitoring.
* ScVO2 monitoring.
* Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy.
* Antibiotics for SBP and possible infection.
* Anticonvulsants for seizure prophylaxis.
* Respiratory support with mechanical ventilation.
* Nutrition support with IV fluids and possible enteral nutrition.
* Glycemic control with insulin as needed.
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports. Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - IVF as needed, though would monitor volume status closely to avoid
   fluid overload (more congestion on CXR today)
   - check CVP, check ScV02
   - Currently on vasopressin
 will hold for now and monitor BPs
   .
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology although leading diagnosis is
   likely post-ictal with slow metabolism or 2mg ativan this morning.
   Other etiologies could be worsening hepatic encephalopathy, although
   had 7 BMs yesterday and was taking her lactulose.  Missed her PM dose
   because of excessive BMs and then did not take anything by mouth this
   morning.  Could be secondary to infection.  Could be status
   epilecticus.  Could be from hyponatremia. Head CT with no evidence for
   acute process. Possibly secondary to bacteremia as below. Also concern
   for cerebral edema.
   - continue to monitor closely for respiratory depression
   - follow up neuro recs
   - F/U infectious workup with blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if enough ascites to tap
   - Avoid ativan and other sedatives
   .
   # Respiratory Status: Intubated with concern over airway protection.
   - Currently undergoing spontaneous breathing trial (seems going well)
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging, collapse
   - Abx with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**].
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   - If S. aureus, will need PICC changed out; if S. epi could be
   contaminant
 consider treating through if only
 bottle positive
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - f/u neuro recs: off meds at this time
   - seizure precautions
   - EEG
   - MRI when stable
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current MELD =
   31.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   .
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD = 31 today.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabalized.
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds.
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down, unclear why; will continue to monitor
   and transfuse for hct <25.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.
   .
   # FEN: albumin for SBP / replete lytes prn / plan to start TF today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I have summarized the key information and potential medical complications that may arise:

**Patient Information:**

* Age: 45 years old
* Sex: Female
* Medical History: Hepatitis C cirrhosis, Hepato-Renal Syndrome, HIV, recent Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP), and new seizures
* Current Condition: Altered mental status, intubated, and on vasopressin

**Assessment and Plan:**

* Shock: Intravascularly dry, possibly secondary to sepsis
* Altered mental status: Unclear etiology, possible causes include post-ictal, worsening hepatic encephalopathy, infection, status epilepticus, or hyponatremia
* Respiratory Status: Intubated, concern over airway protection
* ARF: Creatinine 1.4, likely due to poor renal perfusion, HRS, or prerenal
* Seizures: Unclear etiology, possible causes include liver failure, underlying organic seizure disorder, or medication side effects
* Hypothermia: Possibly infected, currently maintaining body temperature
* Hyponatremia: New hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to diuretic use and possible SIADH
* Hep C Cirrhosis: Underlying condition with worsening bilirubinemia and INR 1.8
* Cholestasis: Possibly due to worsening liver failure or keppra side effect
* Hx SBP: Has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of altered mental status, should worry about new infection
* Hx of ESBL UTI: Stable, s/p treatment with meropenem
* Ascites/LE Edema: Stable, but has tense belly and mild peripheral edema
* HIV: Stable, last CD4 in 600s
* Asthma/COPD: Stable on 3L nasal canula, but respiratory status compromised due to mental status
* Anemia: Slowly trending down, unclear why; will continue to monitor and transfuse for hct <25
* Thrombocytopenia: Stable, likely secondary to liver disease; will continue to trend and tx for <10 or if actively bleeding

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of SBP and new seizures, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and worsening bilirubinemia suggest a possible worsening of hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to intubation and altered mental status, which may lead to respiratory failure.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level of 1.4 and low urine output suggest a risk of developing renal failure.
5. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and history of SBP make it likely that they may develop a new infection.
6. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and anemia make them at risk for bleeding complications.
7. Cerebral Edema: The patient's hyponatremia and altered mental status suggest a possible risk of developing cerebral edema.
8. Liver Failure: The patient's worsening bilirubinemia and INR 1.8 suggest a possible risk of developing liver failure.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Adjust the patient's fluid status and electrolyte levels as needed to prevent complications.
3. Continue to treat the patient's infections with antibiotics and antifungals as prescribed.
4. Consider diagnostic paracentesis to evaluate the patient's ascites and potential infections.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and respiratory status closely.
6. Consider transferring the patient to a liver transplant center if their condition worsens.
7. Continue to educate the patient and their family about their condition and treatment plan."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is a 65-inch tall adult with a weight not specified, admitted to the ICU with oliguric urine output ranging from 10-45 mL/hour. They are receiving hypertonic saline 3% at 40 mL/hour to correct hyponatremia and potential cerebral edema. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa, aldactone, penicillins, and Bactrim. They are currently receiving vasopressin 2.4 units/hour and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 89 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 100/56 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy via an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation. Laboratory results show normal to mildly elevated levels of blood tests, with a white blood cell count of 6.6-11.3 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 8.8-9.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 98-106 x 10^9/L.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are being monitored, and hypertonic saline is being administered to correct the hyponatremia. However, if the sodium levels continue to decrease, it may lead to further complications such as cerebral edema, seizures, and respiratory arrest.
2. Oliguric kidney injury: The patient's urine output is oliguric, which may indicate acute kidney injury. This could lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and the need for dialysis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which may be necessary due to their respiratory failure. However, this could lead to complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, lung injury, and respiratory muscle weakness.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but their heart rate is slightly elevated. This could indicate cardiovascular instability, which may lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and hypotension.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of allergies to certain antibiotics and is receiving vasopressin, which may increase their risk of infection. This could lead to complications such as sepsis, septic shock, and organ failure.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports. Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - IVF as needed, though would monitor volume status closely to avoid
   fluid overload (more congestion on CXR today)
   - check CVP, check ScV02
   - Currently on vasopressin
 will hold for now and monitor BPs
   .
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology although leading diagnosis is
   likely post-ictal with slow metabolism or 2mg ativan this morning.
   Other etiologies could be worsening hepatic encephalopathy, although
   had 7 BMs yesterday and was taking her lactulose.  Missed her PM dose
   because of excessive BMs and then did not take anything by mouth this
   morning.  Could be secondary to infection.  Could be status
   epilecticus.  Could be from hyponatremia. Head CT with no evidence for
   acute process. Possibly secondary to bacteremia as below. Also concern
   for cerebral edema.
   - continue to monitor closely for respiratory depression
   - follow up neuro recs
   - F/U infectious workup with blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if enough ascites to tap
   - Avoid ativan and other sedatives
   .
   # Respiratory Status: Intubated with concern over airway protection.
   - Currently undergoing spontaneous breathing trial (seems going well)
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging, collapse
   - Abx with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**].
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   - If S. aureus, will need PICC changed out; if S. epi could be
   contaminant
 consider treating through if only
 bottle positive
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - f/u neuro recs: off meds at this time
   - seizure precautions
   - EEG
   - MRI when stable
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current MELD =
   31.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   .
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD = 31 today.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabalized.
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds.
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down, unclear why; will continue to monitor
   and transfuse for hct <25.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.
   .
   # FEN: albumin for SBP / replete lytes prn / plan to start TF today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports. Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - IVF as needed, though would monitor volume status closely to avoid
   fluid overload (more congestion on CXR today)
   - check CVP, check ScV02
   - Currently on vasopressin
 will hold for now and monitor BPs
   .
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology although leading diagnosis is
   likely post-ictal with slow metabolism or 2mg ativan this morning.
   Other etiologies could be worsening hepatic encephalopathy, although
   had 7 BMs yesterday and was taking her lactulose.  Missed her PM dose
   because of excessive BMs and then did not take anything by mouth this
   morning.  Could be secondary to infection.  Could be status
   epilecticus.  Could be from hyponatremia. Head CT with no evidence for
   acute process. Possibly secondary to bacteremia as below. Also concern
   for cerebral edema.
   - continue to monitor closely for respiratory depression
   - follow up neuro recs
   - F/U infectious workup with blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if enough ascites to tap
   - Avoid ativan and other sedatives
   .
   # Respiratory Status: Intubated with concern over airway protection.
   - Currently undergoing spontaneous breathing trial (seems going well)
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging, collapse
   - Abx with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**].
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   - If S. aureus, will need PICC changed out; if S. epi could be
   contaminant
 consider treating through if only
 bottle positive
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - f/u neuro recs: off meds at this time
   - seizure precautions
   - EEG
   - MRI when stable
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current MELD =
   31.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   .
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD = 31 today.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabalized.
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds.
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down, unclear why; will continue to monitor
   and transfuse for hct <25.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.
   .
   # FEN: albumin for SBP / replete lytes prn / plan to start TF today

The patient's neurological status is altered, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12. The patient has a history of seizures and is currently receiving treatment with vancomycin and meropenem.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Shock: The patient's blood pressure is low, and her cardiac index is decreased. The patient may be experiencing septic shock due to her underlying liver and kidney dysfunction.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's neurological status is altered, and her GCS score is 12. The patient may be experiencing encephalopathy due to her underlying liver disease or sepsis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to her compromised respiratory status.
4. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and is currently receiving treatment with vancomycin and meropenem.
5. Hepato-renal syndrome: The patient has a history of hepato-renal syndrome, which is a condition characterized by liver and kidney dysfunction.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient has a sodium level of 135 mg/dL, which is low. The patient may be experiencing hyponatremia due to her underlying liver disease or diuretic use.
7. Ascites: The patient has ascites, which is a condition characterized by fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity.
8. Liver failure: The patient has liver failure, which is a condition characterized by liver dysfunction.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Development of hepatorenal syndrome: The patient has a history of hepato-renal syndrome, and her creatinine level is increasing. The patient may develop hepatorenal syndrome if her liver function does not improve.
2. Development of septic shock: The patient has a history of sepsis and is currently receiving treatment with vancomycin and meropenem. The patient may develop septic shock if her sepsis is not adequately treated.
3. Development of respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to her compromised respiratory status. The patient may develop respiratory failure if her respiratory status does not improve.
4. Development of encephalopathy: The patient's neurological status is altered, and her GCS score is 12. The patient may develop encephalopathy if her liver function does not improve.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. IV fluids: The patient is receiving IV fluids to treat her shock and dehydration.
2. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving antibiotics to treat her sepsis and bacterial peritonitis.
3. Vasopressors: The patient is receiving vasopressors to treat her shock and low blood pressure.
4. Mechanical ventilation: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation to treat her respiratory failure.
5. Liver transplant evaluation: The patient is being evaluated for liver transplant due to her liver failure.
6. Renal replacement therapy: The patient may require renal replacement therapy if her kidney function does not improve.
7. Electrolyte replacement: The patient may require electrolyte replacement therapy if her electrolyte levels are abnormal.

The patient's prognosis is guarded due to her complex medical history and ongoing medical complications. The patient's treatment plan will need to be closely monitored and adjusted as necessary to prevent further complications and improve her chances of survival."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch-tall individual with a weight of  unknown, admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleed, hypothermia, and electrolyte and fluid disorder.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.5°C (99.5°F)
* Heart rate: 111 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 94/56 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 24 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* SpO2: 93%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.4 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 7.8 g/dL
* Platelet count: 98 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 16 mEq/L

   24 Hour Events:
   - Vasopressin stopped over concern for contribution to hyponatremia.
   Levophed continued to maintain pressures at 0.06 mcg/kg/mg.
   - Blood cx positive from [**2200-4-27**] speciated to coagulase negative staph.
   As this was 1/4 bottles, thought to be possibly a contaminant.
   Continuing to treat through existing PICC line (though would pull line
   if 2nd bottle positive).
   - Renal recs: ARF likely [**2-25**] prerenal vs. HRS. Given weak response to
   hypertonic saline, consider D/C or change vasopressin. No indication
   for RTT at this time. If metabolic acidosis worsens, may need HD.
   - Liver recs: Continue hypertonic saline, current mgmt (including
   current Abx, hypertonic saline). Pt does not require antifungal
   treatment
   - Neuro recs: 24-hour EEG, repeat head CT
   - Somewhat poor UOP overnight (20-60 cc/hr)
   - Repeat head CT: (prelim read) no cerebral edema (should patient
   develop cerebral edema, pharmacy provided protocol for treatment which
   is in patient's chart)
   - Started on TF

   Studies:
   CT HEAD ([**4-29**] (wet-read):  No evidence intracranial hemorrhage
   EEG ([**4-27**]) This is an abnormal portable EEG due to slowing,
   disorganization, and attenuation of the background consistent with a
   moderate to severe encephalopathy. Medications, toxic/metabolic
   disturbances, or infection are common causes. No focal areas of
   slowing, epileptiform discharges, or electrographic seizures were seen
   during this recording.
   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports. Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - IVF as needed, though would monitor volume status closely to avoid
   fluid overload
   -  CVP 8-12
   - check ScV02
   - continue levophed to MAP >60
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging, collapse
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.
   - 24 hour EEG
   - Neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin will need ID
   approval)
   - F/U final read CT head
   - continue to correct hyponatremia
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**].
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   - If S. aureus, will need PICC changed out; if S. epi could be
   contaminant
 consider treating through if only
 bottle positive
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - f/u final read CT head
   - MRI when stable
   - F/U with neuro regarding starting anti-epileptics (concern with
   Keppra due to elevated LFT)
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 24 hours with hypertonic saline.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD score of 33
   this AM.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Studies:
   CT HEAD ([**4-29**] (wet-read):  No evidence intracranial hemorrhage
   EEG ([**4-27**]) This is an abnormal portable EEG due to slowing,

   disturbances, or infection are common causes. No focal areas of
   slowing, epileptiform discharges, or electrographic seizures were seen
   during this recording.
   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports. Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - IVF as needed, though would monitor volume status closely to avoid
   fluid overload
   -  CVP 8-12
   - check ScV02
   - continue levophed to MAP >60
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging, collapse
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.
   - 24 hour EEG
   - Neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis)

   approval)
   - F/U final read CT head
   - continue to correct hyponatremia
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**].
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   - If S. aureus, will need PICC changed out; if S. epi could be
   contaminant
 consider treating through if only
 bottle positive
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - f/u final read CT head
   - MRI when stable
   - F/U with neuro regarding starting anti-epileptics (concern with
   Keppra due to elevated LFT)
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 24 hours with hypertonic saline.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD score of 33
   this AM.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a complex medical history, including Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and a recent episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and seizures. The patient is currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and multi-organ dysfunction.

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture with coagulase-negative staph, which may be a contaminant or a true infection. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, but the etiology of the infection is unclear.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of liver failure and is at risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy, which may be contributing to her altered mental status.
3. Renal failure: The patient has a creatinine level of 1.4, which is likely due to poor renal perfusion and may be secondary to hepato-renal syndrome.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has a sodium level of 136, which is being treated with hypertonic saline.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation due to her altered mental status and respiratory failure.
6. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures and may be experiencing them currently, although the etiology is unclear.
7. Cholestasis: The patient has a rising bilirubin level, which may be due to worsening liver failure or a side effect of the medication keppra.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Shock: The patient appears to have intravascular dryness on examination and laboratory reports, which may be secondary to sepsis or other factors.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to her altered mental status and respiratory failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient has a creatinine level of 1.4, which is likely due to poor renal perfusion and may be secondary to hepato-renal syndrome.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has a sodium level of 136, which is being treated with hypertonic saline.
5. Cholestasis: The patient has a rising bilirubin level, which may be due to worsening liver failure or a side effect of the medication keppra.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a platelet count of 98, which is likely secondary to liver disease.
7. Anemia: The patient has a hemoglobin level of 7.8, which is slowly trending down and may be due to chronic disease or bleeding.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 9.4, Hct 25.6, Platelet count 98
* Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): 22.6
* Creatinine: 1.4
* Sodium: 136
* Potassium: 4.2
* Chloride: 110
* CO2: 20
* Glucose: 115
* Liver function tests (LFTs): ALT 35, AST 76, Alk Phos 224, T Bili 16.2
* Coagulation studies: PT 29.7, PTT 61.1, INR 3.0

The patient's imaging studies are as follows:

* Computed Tomography (CT) head: No evidence of acute process or cerebral edema.
* Electroencephalogram (EEG): Abnormal, consistent with moderate to severe encephalopathy.
* Chest X-ray (CXR): Possible right lower lobe opacity.

The patient's medications include:

* Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem)
* Sedatives (ativan)
* Anti-seizure medication (keppra)
* Lactulose
* Proton pump inhibitors (PPI)
* Pneumoboots
* Bowel regimen
* Albumin
* Octreotide
* Midodrine

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis and organ dysfunction
* Correcting hyponatremia with hypertonic saline
* Continuing lactulose and other medications as needed
* Considering diagnostic paracentesis and MRI when stable
* F/u with neuro regarding starting anti-epileptics
* Continuing to trend LFTs and coags
* Holding diuretics and considering albumin and octreotide
* F/u with liver team regarding transplant evaluation
* Continuing to monitor and treat for anemia and thrombocytopenia."

   Studies:
   CT HEAD ([**4-29**] (wet-read):  No evidence intracranial hemorrhage
   EEG ([**4-27**]) This is an abnormal portable EEG due to slowing,
   disorganization, and attenuation of the background consistent with a
   moderate to severe encephalopathy. Medications, toxic/metabolic
   disturbances, or infection are common causes. No focal areas of
   slowing, epileptiform discharges, or electrographic seizures were seen
   during this recording.
   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports. Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - IVF as needed, though would monitor volume status closely to avoid
   fluid overload
   -  CVP 8-12
   - check ScV02 (91% yesterday)
   - continue levophed to MAP >60 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging, collapse
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Volume-cycled assist control, low tidal volume
 if PaO2 worsens,
   increase PEEP
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity. Continues minimally
   responsive to pain.
   - 24 hour EEG
   - Neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin will need ID
   approval)
   - F/U final read CT head
   - continue to correct hyponatremia
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out).
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - f/u final read CT head
   - MRI when stable
   - F/U with neuro regarding starting anti-epileptics (concern with
   Keppra due to elevated LFT)
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 24 hours with hypertonic saline.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD score of 33
   this AM.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds.
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   - 1 unit pRBCs today
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down, unclear why; will continue to monitor
   and transfuse for hct <25.
   - recheck HCT this AM
   -  check stool for microscopic blood
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Vasopressin stopped over concern for contribution to hyponatremia.
   Levophed continued to maintain pressures at 0.06 mcg/kg/mg.
   - Blood cx positive from [**2200-4-27**] speciated to coagulase negative staph.
   As this was 1/4 bottles, thought to be possibly a contaminant.
   Continuing to treat through existing PICC line (though would pull line
   if 2nd bottle positive).
   - Renal recs: ARF likely [**2-25**] prerenal vs. HRS. Given weak response to
   hypertonic saline, consider D/C or change vasopressin. No indication
   for RTT at this time. If metabolic acidosis worsens, may need HD.
   - Liver recs: Continue hypertonic saline, current mgmt (including
   current Abx, hypertonic saline). Pt does not require antifungal
   treatment
   - Neuro recs: 24-hour EEG, repeat head CT
   - Somewhat poor UOP overnight (20-60 cc/hr)
   - Repeat head CT: (prelim read) no cerebral edema (should patient
   develop cerebral edema, pharmacy provided protocol for treatment which
   is in patient's chart)
   - Started on TF
   - Needs to have family meeting scheduled to discuss goals of care
   - Na trended up appropriately with hypertonic saline to 136
   - Gave bolus of NS for hypotension/tachycardia 500 cc

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, HIV, and recent SBP who is being treated in the ICU for altered mental status, shock, and respiratory failure. She has developed hyponatremia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, and is being treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and diuretics. Her liver function tests are elevated, and she has a MELD score of 33.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status, fever, and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could be caused by a variety of pathogens, including coagulase-negative staphylococcus.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's history of cirrhosis, shock, and low urine output suggest the possibility of hepatorenal syndrome, which could be exacerbated by the patient's hyponatremia and diuretic use.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to her altered mental status and respiratory failure, which could lead to further complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Seizure disorder: The patient's history of seizures and the presence of an abnormal EEG suggest the possibility of a seizure disorder, which could be caused by a variety of factors, including liver failure, infection, or medication.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia could lead to further complications, such as seizures, coma, or even death if not treated promptly and effectively.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia could lead to further complications, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, or decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia could lead to bleeding complications, such as petechiae, ecchymoses, or even life-threatening bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to detect any changes or complications early.
2. Continue to treat the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and vasopressors, and consider adding antifungal therapy if the patient's condition does not improve.
3. Consider initiating hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy if the patient's creatinine level continues to rise.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider intubation if the patient's respiratory failure worsens.
5. Consider starting anticonvulsant therapy if the patient's seizure disorder is not controlled with medication.
6. Continue to correct the patient's hyponatremia with hypertonic saline and consider adding diuretics if the patient's urine output does not improve.
7. Continue to transfuse blood products, such as platelets and red blood cells, as needed to support the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia.
8. Consider referring the patient to a liver transplant center if the patient's liver function does not improve with treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports. Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - IVF as needed, though would monitor volume status closely to avoid
   fluid overload
   -  CVP 8-12
   - check ScV02 (91% on [**4-29**])
   - continue levophed to MAP >60 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging, collapse
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity. Continues minimally
   responsive to pain.
   - 24 hour EEG in progress
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out).
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AEL at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 139 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD score of 33
   this AM.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AEL
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, Hepato-Renal Syndrome, HIV, and recent Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP). She was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with altered mental status, hypotension, and respiratory distress. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, but she has a low urine output, and her electrolyte levels are abnormal. She has a positive blood culture and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. She is also receiving vasopressors to maintain her blood pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status, hypotension, and positive blood culture suggest sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
2. Hepato-Renal Syndrome (HRS): The patient's history of HRS and current low urine output and abnormal electrolyte levels suggest that she may be at risk for further deterioration of her renal function.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and need for mechanical ventilation suggest that she may be at risk for respiratory failure.
4. Seizures: The patient's history of seizures and abnormal EEG findings suggest that she may be at risk for further seizures.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia and abnormal electrolyte levels suggest that she may be at risk for further electrolyte imbalance.
6. Infection: The patient's positive blood culture and abnormal white blood cell count suggest that she may have an underlying infection.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia and abnormal platelet count suggest that she may be at risk for bleeding.
8. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and abnormal liver function tests suggest that she may be at risk for hepatic encephalopathy.
9. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and abnormal coagulation studies suggest that she may be at risk for further bleeding.
10. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism suggest that she may be at risk for further pulmonary embolism.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her sepsis, HRS, and respiratory failure. She should be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and vasopressors to maintain her blood pressure. Her electrolyte levels should be closely monitored and corrected as necessary. She should also be treated with anticonvulsants to prevent further seizures. Her thrombocytopenia should be managed with platelet transfusions and her coagulation studies should be closely monitored. Her gastrointestinal bleeding should be managed with endoscopy and coagulation studies should be performed regularly. Her pulmonary embolism should be managed with anticoagulation therapy and her deep vein thrombosis should be managed with compression stockings and anticoagulation therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP this AM.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - check ScV02 (91% on [**4-29**])
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   this morning.
   - 24 hour EEG in progress: prelim read
 epileptiform activity; neuro
   considering starting AED (?zonegran)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out).
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AEL at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 139 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AEL
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and recent SBP and seizures. She is being treated in the MICU for altered mental status, respiratory failure, and multiple organ dysfunction.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated and mechanically ventilated with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 40%, and PEEP 10 cmH2O. She has a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 530 mL.
* Cardiovascular: She has a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 122 mmHg and a heart rate of 92 beats per minute. She is receiving norepinephrine infusion at 0.03 mcg/kg/min.
* Neurological: She has altered mental status, possibly secondary to seizure activity, hepatic encephalopathy, or infection. She is intubated and sedated.
* Renal: She has acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL and a urine output of 717 mL over the past 24 hours.
* Hepatic: She has liver failure with a bilirubin level of 65 mg/dL and an INR of 1.8.
* Hematological: She has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 66,000/mm3 and anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL.
* Infection: She has a positive blood culture with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, which may be a contaminant. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Sepsis: Given her altered mental status, respiratory failure, and multiple organ dysfunction, sepsis is a possible complication.
* Hepatic encephalopathy: Her altered mental status and elevated bilirubin level suggest the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy.
* Infection: Her positive blood culture and respiratory failure suggest the possibility of infection.
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Her respiratory failure and bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph suggest the possibility of ARDS.
* Hepatorenal syndrome: Her acute kidney injury and liver failure suggest the possibility of hepatorenal syndrome.
* Seizures: Her altered mental status and seizure activity suggest the possibility of seizures.

The plan is to:

* Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for now.
* Monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload.
* Continue levophed to maintain MAP >75 PRN.
* Consider starting AED for seizure activity.
* Monitor sodium level carefully and continue to hold diuretics.
* Trend electrolytes and continue to monitor liver function tests.
* Consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites.
* Continue to hold diuretics for now.
* Monitor CD4 count and continue home meds.
* Continue to trend HCT and transfuse for HCT <25.
* Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.
* Continue to trend platelet count and transfuse for <10 or if actively bleeding.
* Continue albumin for SBP and replete lytes PRN.
* Continue PPI IV and pneumoboots given thrombocytopenia.
* Continue bowel regimen.
* Continue to monitor patient's condition and adjust plan as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports. Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - IVF as needed, though would monitor volume status closely to avoid
   fluid overload
   -  CVP 8-12
   - check ScV02 (91% on [**4-29**])
   - continue levophed to MAP >60 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging, collapse
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity. Continues minimally
   responsive to pain.
   - 24 hour EEG in progress
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out).
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AEL at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 139 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.

   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the

   this AM.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AEL
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports. Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - IVF as needed, though would monitor volume status closely to avoid
   fluid overload
   -  CVP 8-12
   - check ScV02 (91% on [**4-29**])
   - continue levophed to MAP >60 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging, collapse
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity. Continues minimally
   responsive to pain.
   - 24 hour EEG in progress
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out).
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AEL at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 139 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD score of 33
   this AM.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AEL
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and recent sepsis. She is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU due to altered mental status and concern for airway protection. She has a history of seizures, and her recent EEG suggests encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being the most common causes. She has also had recent episodes of hypotension, which is being managed with norepinephrine infusions.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Creatinine 1.4 mg/dL, with a low urine output
* Hyponatremia, which has resolved with hypertonic saline
* Elevated INR and bilirubinemia, suggesting worsening liver failure
* Thrombocytopenia, likely secondary to liver disease
* Anemia, which is slowly trending down
* Elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Intubated and sedated
* Warm, jaundiced skin
* Right lower extremity edema (1+), left lower extremity edema (1+)
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* Normal cardiovascular examination

The patient's medical history includes:

* Hepatitis C cirrhosis
* Hepato-renal syndrome
* HIV
* Recent sepsis
* Recent SBP and new seizures
* History of ESBL UTI
* History of asthma/COPD

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Hepatic encephalopathy
* Infection (sepsis, UTI, pneumonia)
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac complications (hypotension, arrhythmias)
* Renal failure
* Gastrointestinal complications (ascites, bleeding)
* Neurological complications (seizures, encephalopathy)
* Thrombocytopenia
* Anemia
* Hyponatremia

Based on the patient's condition and medical history, I recommend the following:

* Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and airway protection
* Maintain the patient's hydration and electrolyte balance
* Continue to manage the patient's hypotension with norepinephrine infusions
* Monitor the patient's liver function and consider treatment for hepatic encephalopathy
* Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and consider treatment for acute kidney injury
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider treatment for respiratory failure
* Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and consider treatment for cardiac complications
* Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and consider treatment for gastrointestinal complications
* Monitor the patient's neurological status and consider treatment for neurological complications
* Monitor the patient's thrombocytopenia and consider treatment for bleeding
* Monitor the patient's anemia and consider treatment for anemia
* Monitor the patient's hyponatremia and consider treatment for hyponatremia"

   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP this AM.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - check ScV02 (91% on [**4-29**])
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics but change vancomycin to 750mg
   Q24 and dose by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   this morning.
   - 24 hour EEG in progress: prelim read
 epileptiform activity; neuro
   considering starting AED (?zonegran)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out).
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on trough
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AEL at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 139 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AEL
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP this AM.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - check ScV02 (91% on [**4-29**])
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics but change vancomycin to 750mg
   Q24 and dose by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   this morning.
   - 24 hour EEG in progress: prelim read
 epileptiform activity; neuro
   considering starting AED (?zonegran)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic

   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on trough
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AEL at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 139 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AEL
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, and HIV. She was transferred to the MICU with altered mental status, hypotension, and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for inability to protect airway. The patient has a picture consistent with ARDS and may meet criteria for ARDS. Bronchoscopy revealed mucous plugging and collapse.
* Neurological: Altered mental status with unclear etiology, differential including seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia, and medication-induced. EEG showed epileptiform activity, and the patient is being considered for AED therapy.
* Renal: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0) likely due to poor renal perfusion, HRS, or prerenal. The patient has a low urine output, and the possibility of HRS is being considered.
* Infection: Positive blood culture for coag-negative staph, possibly a contaminant. The patient is being treated empirically with vancomycin and meropenem.
* Fluid and electrolyte status: Hyponatremia has resolved, but the patient is still at risk for fluid overload. The patient has a low urine sodium, and the possibility of HRS is being considered.
* Liver function: INR 1.8, bilirubinemia, and cholestasis. The patient has a history of liver failure and is being evaluated for transplant.
* Seizure disorder: The patient has a seizure disorder, and the differential includes swelling from liver failure, underlying organic seizure disorder, or medication-induced.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated, and the possibility of ARDS is being considered. The patient may require prolonged mechanical ventilation.
* Neurological deterioration: The patient's altered mental status may worsen, and the possibility of further seizures or brain edema is being considered.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.4, and the possibility of HRS is being considered. The patient may require dialysis.
* Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture, and the possibility of sepsis is being considered. The patient may require further antibiotics and treatment.
* Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient is at risk for fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance, particularly hyponatremia.
* Liver failure: The patient has a history of liver failure and is being evaluated for transplant. The patient may require further liver support and treatment.
* Seizure disorder: The patient has a seizure disorder, and the differential includes swelling from liver failure, underlying organic seizure disorder, or medication-induced. The patient may require further treatment and monitoring.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and close monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent potential complications and improve her outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, Hepato-Renal Syndrome, HIV, and recent Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP). She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and hypotension. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, as well as vasopressor support. She has a history of seizures, and a 24-hour EEG is in progress to determine the etiology of her altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status, hypotension, and positive blood cultures suggest sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and treatment.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's history of liver disease and altered mental status suggest the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy, which can be caused by liver failure, infection, or other factors.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure, as indicated by her need for mechanical ventilation, is a potential complication that requires close monitoring and treatment.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's history of Hepato-Renal Syndrome and current creatinine level of 1.4 suggest the possibility of renal failure, which can be caused by liver disease, sepsis, or other factors.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia, which was corrected with hypertonic saline, is a potential complication that requires close monitoring and treatment.
6. Seizures: The patient's history of seizures and the ongoing 24-hour EEG suggest the possibility of seizure activity, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including liver disease, infection, or medication side effects.
7. Infection: The patient's positive blood cultures and respiratory failure suggest the possibility of infection, which requires prompt recognition and treatment.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of SBP and current ascites suggest the possibility of gastrointestinal complications, including bleeding or perforation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including her blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
2. Continue to administer antibiotics and antifungals as needed to treat potential infections.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
5. Consider the use of AEDs to treat seizure activity, and monitor the patient's seizure activity closely.
6. Consider the use of diuretics to manage ascites and peripheral edema.
7. Monitor the patient's liver function and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
8. Consider the use of antiviral therapy to treat Hepatitis C."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP this AM.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics but change vancomycin to 750mg
   Q24 and dose by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   this morning.
   - 24 hour EEG completed: prelim read
 epileptiform activity though no
   definite seizure activity (No AED at this time)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.7 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   - Discuss with family goals of care, CVVH (may not improve status
   overall)
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   - Check bladder pressure
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AED
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, Hepato-Renal Syndrome, and HIV. She is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with altered mental status, intubated, and receiving mechanical ventilation. She has a history of recent SBP, seizures, and ESBL UTI. Her current lab results show worsening metabolic acidosis, increasing creatinine, and hyponatremia. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, levophed, and lactulose.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Shock: The patient appears to be in shock, with a low MAP and a high CVP. This may be due to sepsis, poor renal perfusion, or other factors.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, but she may require further respiratory support or consideration for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to a variety of factors, including seizure activity, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia, or medication-induced encephalopathy.
4. Sepsis: The patient has a history of recent SBP and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. She may be at risk for developing sepsis or septic shock.
5. Hepato-Renal Syndrome: The patient has a history of Hepato-Renal Syndrome, which may be worsening due to poor renal perfusion or other factors.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may be due to diuretic use, SIADH, or other factors. She may require further management to correct her sodium levels.
7. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures and may require further evaluation and management to control her seizure activity.
8. Cholestatic Jaundice: The patient has a history of cholestatic jaundice, which may be due to worsening liver failure or keppra side effects.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may be due to liver disease or other factors. She may require further evaluation and management to control her platelet count.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and clinical status closely.
2. Consider further evaluation and management for shock, respiratory failure, and altered mental status.
3. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis and consider further evaluation and management for septic shock.
4. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and consider further evaluation and management for Hepato-Renal Syndrome.
5. Continue to manage the patient's hyponatremia and consider further evaluation and management for SIADH.
6. Consider further evaluation and management for seizures, including EEG and MRI.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and consider further evaluation and management for thrombocytopenia.
8. Consider further evaluation and management for cholestatic jaundice, including liver function tests and imaging studies.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and consider further evaluation and management for acute kidney injury.

Note: The above summary and recommendations are based on the provided medical record and may not reflect the actual clinical situation or the patient's current condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP this AM.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics but change vancomycin to 750mg
   Q24 and dose by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   this morning.
   - 24 hour EEG completed: prelim read
 epileptiform activity though no
   definite seizure activity (No AED at this time)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on trough
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AEL at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 139 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AEL
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, and HIV. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and septic shock. She is currently intubated and receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her laboratory results show worsening metabolic acidosis, increasing creatinine, and hyponatremia. She has a history of seizures, and a 24-hour EEG showed epileptiform activity, but no definite seizure activity. Her physical examination shows bilateral UE/LE pitting edema, warm skin, and jaundice.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock and worsening metabolic acidosis suggest a high risk of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and fluid status is essential to prevent fluid overload.
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient's creatinine levels and urine output suggest a high risk of HRS. Close monitoring of urine output and creatinine levels is necessary to prevent further kidney damage.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is a concern, particularly in the setting of rising INR and creatinine levels. Close monitoring of sodium levels and fluid status is essential to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.
4. Seizures: The patient's history of seizures and epileptiform activity on EEG suggest a high risk of seizure recurrence. Close monitoring of seizure activity and consideration of anti-seizure medications are necessary.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure and intubation suggest a high risk of respiratory complications, particularly in the setting of sepsis and liver failure.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR and platelet count suggest a high risk of coagulopathy. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and consideration of anticoagulant therapy are necessary.
7. Infection: The patient's history of SBP and recent antibiotic administration suggest a high risk of infection. Close monitoring of laboratory results and consideration of diagnostic paracentesis are necessary to identify and treat any potential infections.
8. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function tests and bilirubin levels suggest a high risk of liver failure. Close monitoring of liver function and consideration of liver transplantation are necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential infections.
2. Monitor vital signs, laboratory results, and fluid status closely to prevent fluid overload and sepsis.
3. Continue anti-seizure medications as necessary to prevent seizure recurrence.
4. Monitor urine output and creatinine levels closely to prevent further kidney damage.
5. Continue to monitor sodium levels and fluid status to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.
6. Consider diagnostic paracentesis to identify and treat potential infections.
7. Monitor coagulation parameters and consider anticoagulant therapy as necessary.
8. Consider liver transplantation if the patient's liver function continues to decline."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP this AM.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics but change vancomycin to 750mg
   Q24 and dose by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   this morning.
   - 24 hour EEG completed: prelim read
 epileptiform activity though no
   definite seizure activity (No AED at this time)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.7 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AED
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, Hepato-Renal Syndrome, and HIV. She was admitted to the MICU with altered mental status, seizures, and respiratory failure. She has a history of recent SBP and new seizures. Her current conditions include:

* Shock: Intravascularly dry, possibly secondary to sepsis or poor renal perfusion.
* Respiratory failure: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for airway protection, possibly meeting criteria for ARDS.
* Altered mental status: Unclear etiology, possibly due to seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia, or medication-induced.
* ARF: Creatinine 1.7, likely due to poor renal perfusion, HRS, or prerenal.
* Seizures: Unclear etiology, possibly secondary to liver failure, underlying organic seizure disorder, or medication-induced.
* Hyponatremia: Resolved, but concern for possible hepatorenal syndrome.
* Hypothermia: Possibly infected, empirically treated with vancomycin.
* Hepatitis C cirrhosis: Underlying liver disease, worsening bilirubinemia, and cholestasis.
* Cholestasis: Possibly due to worsening liver failure or keppra side effect.
* Hx SBP: Started on cipro prophylaxis, but should consider diagnostic paracentesis.
* Hx of ESBL UTI: Stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
* Ascites/LE Edema: Stable, but with tense belly and mild peripheral edema.
* HIV: Stable, last CD4 in 600s.
* Anemia: Trending down, with guaiac + stool, and transfused for Hct <25.
* Thrombocytopenia: Stable, likely secondary to liver disease, with trend and tx for <10 or actively bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Due to shock, respiratory failure, and altered mental status.
2. ARDS: Possibly due to respiratory failure and sepsis.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome: Due to worsening bilirubinemia and creatinine.
4. Infection: Due to hyponatremia, hypothermia, and cholestasis.
5. Liver failure: Due to worsening bilirubinemia and cholestasis.
6. Seizure disorder: Due to unclear etiology and possible underlying organic seizure disorder.
7. Hyponatremia: Due to diuretic use, SIADH, or possible hepatorenal syndrome.
8. Thrombocytopenia: Due to liver disease and possible bleeding.
9. Anemia: Due to chronic blood loss, bone marrow suppression, or hemolysis.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis and ARDS.
2. Monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload.
3. Continue levophed to maintain MAP >75 PRN.
4. Follow urine output closely and bolus if <30 cc/hr.
5. Dose vancomycin based on level.
6. Continue lactulose for encephalopathy.
7. Monitor sodium level carefully and hold diuretics.
8. Trend electrolytes and consider albumin, octreotide, and midodrine.
9. Continue to monitor and transfuse for Hct <25.
10. Consider diagnostic paracentesis for SBP and ESBL UTI.
11. Continue to trend LFTs and coags.
12. F/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely candidate given comorbidities.
13. Continue to hold diuretics for hyponatremia and monitor sodium level carefully.
14. F/u hepatology recs.
15. Avoid sedatives and medications that lower the seizure threshold."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple organ dysfunction. They are receiving vasopressor support with norepinephrine and have a low urine output of approximately 25 cc/hr. The patient has a history of allergic reactions to sulfa, penicillins, and Bactrim, and is currently receiving vancomycin and meropenem antibiotics. They have a central venous catheter and an arterial line in place.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 118/65 mmHg. They are receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode and have a SpO2 of 96%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient's urine sediment is consistent with ATN, which can lead to chronic kidney disease and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
2. Hepatic Failure: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may indicate liver damage or failure. This can lead to coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and increased risk of infections.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a low tidal volume and high peak inspiratory pressure. They are at risk for respiratory failure and the need for intubation.
4. Sepsis: The patient's low urine output and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, but they are still receiving vasopressor support. They are at risk for hypotension and cardiac arrest if the vasopressors are discontinued.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's potassium and phosphorus levels are elevated, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and decreased platelet count suggest the possibility of coagulopathy, which can increase the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple organ dysfunction and death. Close monitoring and management of their condition are necessary to prevent complications and improve their outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   - 24 hour EEG completed: prelim read
 epileptiform activity though no
   definite seizure activity (No AED at this time)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinin trending up to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely
   due to poor renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na
   concern for development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - re-check urine lytes and sediment, re-check Creatinine later in day
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   - Discuss with family goals of care, CVVH (may not improve status
   overall)
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   - Check bladder pressure
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AED
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   - 24 hour EEG completed: prelim read
 epileptiform activity though no
   definite seizure activity (No AED at this time)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinin trending up to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely
   due to poor renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na
   concern for development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - re-check urine lytes and sediment, re-check Creatinine later in day
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   - Discuss with family goals of care, CVVH (may not improve status
   overall)
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   - Check bladder pressure
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AED
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, Hepato-Renal Syndrome, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with altered mental status, sepsis, and respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for inability to protect airway. The patient has a picture consistent with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging and collapse.
* Cardiovascular: The patient appears intravascularly dry on exam and laboratory reports, with a CVP of 8-12 mmHg. She is being treated with norepinephrine to maintain a MAP >75 mmHg.
* Neurological: The patient has altered mental status, with a unclear etiology. The differential diagnosis includes seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia, and medication-induced encephalopathy. The patient has had a 24-hour EEG, which showed epileptiform activity, but no definite seizure activity.
* Renal: The patient has acute kidney injury, with a creatinine trending up to 2.4 mg/dL. The likely cause is poor renal perfusion, Hepato-Renal Syndrome, or pre-renal azotemia.
* Hepatic: The patient has liver failure, with an INR of 1.8 and worsening bilirubinemia. She has intermittent encephalopathy and is being evaluated for liver transplantation.
* Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, which may be a contaminant. She is being treated empirically with vancomycin and meropenem.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to her underlying liver and kidney disease, as well as her positive blood culture.
* ARDS: The patient has a picture consistent with ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
* Hepato-Renal Syndrome: The patient has a high risk of developing Hepato-Renal Syndrome, which can lead to renal failure and death.
* Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture and is being treated empirically with antibiotics. However, she is at high risk of developing further infections due to her underlying disease and immunosuppression.
* Seizures: The patient has had a seizure and has a high risk of developing further seizures due to her underlying liver and kidney disease, as well as her medication regimen.
* Hyponatremia: The patient has had hyponatremia, which can lead to seizures, coma, and death if not treated promptly.
* Hypothermia: The patient has a high risk of developing hypothermia due to her underlying disease and the cold environment of the ICU.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan should be implemented:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust her ventilator settings as needed.
* Continue to treat the patient's sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics and consider adding additional antibiotics as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her fluid management accordingly.
* Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and adjust her medication regimen accordingly.
* Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status closely and adjust her medication regimen accordingly.
* Consider performing a diagnostic paracentesis to evaluate the patient's ascites and potential infections.
* Consider performing a MRI to evaluate the patient's seizures and potential underlying organic seizure disorder.
* Consider performing a liver biopsy to evaluate the patient's liver disease and potential for liver transplantation.
* Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medication regimen accordingly.
* Continue to monitor the patient's temperature and adjust her fluid management accordingly.
* Consider adding additional medications to the patient's regimen to help manage her symptoms and prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, HIV, and recent Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP). She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and septic shock. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, creatinine, and bilirubin levels, indicating liver and renal dysfunction. She has a history of seizures and is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to detect any deterioration in her condition.
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient's elevated creatinine and bilirubin levels, along with her history of liver cirrhosis, suggest the possibility of HRS. Close monitoring of her renal function and urine output is necessary to detect any deterioration in her condition.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to her altered mental status, septic shock, and liver and renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary to detect any deterioration in her condition.
4. Seizures: The patient's history of seizures and her current altered mental status suggest the possibility of ongoing seizure activity. Close monitoring of her neurological status and seizure activity is necessary to detect any deterioration in her condition.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is likely due to her diuretic use and possible SIADH. Close monitoring of her sodium levels and fluid balance is necessary to detect any deterioration in her condition.
6. Hypothermia: The patient's hypothermia is likely due to her septic shock and liver dysfunction. Close monitoring of her body temperature and cardiovascular status is necessary to detect any deterioration in her condition.
7. Cholestatic Liver Disease: The patient's elevated bilirubin levels and cholestatic liver disease suggest the possibility of ongoing liver damage. Close monitoring of her liver function and bilirubin levels is necessary to detect any deterioration in her condition.
8. HIV-Related Complications: The patient's HIV infection may contribute to her ongoing complications, such as sepsis, respiratory failure, and liver and renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of her HIV-related symptoms and laboratory results is necessary to detect any deterioration in her condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat sepsis and potential bacterial infections.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory status closely to detect any deterioration in her condition.
3. Consider the use of vasopressors to maintain blood pressure and perfusion in the presence of septic shock.
4. Monitor the patient's neurological status and seizure activity closely to detect any deterioration in her condition.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels to detect any deterioration in her condition.
6. Consider the use of albumin and other therapies to treat HRS and liver dysfunction.
7. Monitor the patient's HIV-related symptoms and laboratory results closely to detect any deterioration in her condition.
8. Consider the use of antiretroviral therapy to treat HIV-related complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   - 24 hour EEG completed: prelim read
 epileptiform activity though no
   definite seizure activity (No AED at this time)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinin trending up to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely
   due to poor renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na
   concern for development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - re-check urine lytes and sediment, re-check Creatinine later in day
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   - Discuss with family goals of care, CVVH (may not improve status
   overall)
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   - Check bladder pressure
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AED
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2200-5-2**]:
   - Continues on levophed, which was increased from 0.05 to 0.07mcg in
   order to maintain MAP >75 O/N. UOP remains stably low at ~25 cc/hr.
   - Renal: No need for RRT, okay to give HCO3 PRN. Urine sediment
   consistent with ATN or HRS.
   - Neuro: 48-hr EEG monitoring w/o sz. Would not recommend AED at this
   time.
   - Liver: Send another C. diff. Recommend central access to monitor
   intravascular status. Not transplant candidate.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a complex medical history, including Hepatitis C cirrhosis, HIV, and recent episodes of sepsis, seizures, and liver failure. She is currently admitted to the MICU with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 118/65 mmHg. Her respiratory status is compromised due to her altered mental status, with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), as well as elevated bilirubin levels. Her renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL and a urine output of 25 cc/hr. Her electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.

The patient's medical history is significant for recent episodes of sepsis, seizures, and liver failure, as well as a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and HIV. She has also had a recent episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and has been treated with antibiotics.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, meropenem, and lactulose, as well as other medications for her underlying conditions. She is also receiving supportive care, including mechanical ventilation and fluid resuscitation.

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's history of sepsis and recent episodes of SBP increase her risk of developing sepsis again.
2. Liver failure: The patient's liver function is impaired, and she may develop further liver failure if not managed properly.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she may develop further kidney damage if not managed properly.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and she may develop further respiratory failure if not managed properly.
5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and recent episodes of sepsis increase her risk of developing further infections.
6. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and liver disease increase her risk of bleeding if not managed properly.
7. Hypothermia: The patient's history of hypothermia and recent episodes of sepsis increase her risk of developing further hypothermia.

In conclusion, this patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications. She requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve her outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   - 24 hour EEG completed: prelim read
 epileptiform activity though no
   definite seizure activity (No AED at this time)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinin trending up to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely
   due to poor renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na
   concern for development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - re-check urine lytes and sediment, re-check Creatinine later in day
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   - Discuss with family goals of care, CVVH (may not improve status
   overall)
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   - Check bladder pressure
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AED
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, and HIV. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, seizures, and respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her laboratory results show evidence of liver and kidney dysfunction, as well as hyponatremia. She has a positive blood culture for coag-negative staphylococcus, which may be a contaminant. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and has been given vancomycin and meropenem.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show evidence of infection, and she is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, the possibility of sepsis cannot be ruled out, and the patient should be closely monitored for signs of sepsis, such as fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea.
2. Hepato-renal syndrome: The patient's liver and kidney function are compromised, and she is at risk for developing hepato-renal syndrome. She should be closely monitored for signs of worsening liver and kidney function, such as increased bilirubin levels, decreased urine output, and decreased blood pressure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. However, she may require additional respiratory support, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), to manage her respiratory failure.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is a concern, and she should be closely monitored for signs of worsening hyponatremia, such as increased urine output, decreased blood pressure, and decreased level of consciousness.
5. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture for coag-negative staphylococcus, which may be a contaminant. However, the possibility of infection cannot be ruled out, and the patient should be closely monitored for signs of infection, such as fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea.
6. Liver failure: The patient's liver function is compromised, and she is at risk for developing liver failure. She should be closely monitored for signs of worsening liver function, such as increased bilirubin levels, decreased albumin levels, and decreased coagulation factors.
7. Kidney failure: The patient's kidney function is compromised, and she is at risk for developing kidney failure. She should be closely monitored for signs of worsening kidney function, such as increased creatinine levels, decreased urine output, and decreased blood pressure.
8. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures, and she should be closely monitored for signs of seizure activity, such as twitching, jerking, or loss of consciousness.
9. Hypermagnesemia: The patient's magnesium levels are elevated, and she should be closely monitored for signs of hypermagnesemia, such as muscle weakness, fatigue, and decreased level of consciousness.
10. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are low, and she should be closely monitored for signs of hypoglycemia, such as tremors, shakiness, and confusion.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status.
2. Consider the possibility of sepsis and infection, and monitor for signs of worsening infection.
3. Continue to treat the patient's liver and kidney dysfunction with supportive care and medication.
4. Consider the possibility of liver failure and kidney failure, and monitor for signs of worsening organ dysfunction.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's seizure activity and consider the possibility of hypermagnesemia.
6. Consider the possibility of hypoglycemia and monitor for signs of low blood sugar.
7. Continue to provide supportive care, including mechanical ventilation, and consider the possibility of additional respiratory support.
8. Consider the possibility of ascites and monitor for signs of fluid accumulation.
9. Consider the possibility of bleeding and monitor for signs of bleeding, such as decreased blood pressure and decreased urine output.
10. Continue to communicate with the patient's family and healthcare providers to ensure that the patient's needs are being met and that the patient is receiving the best possible care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome with
   worsening renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP.   Increased pressor requirement overnight
   to maintain MAP > 75
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12 (though no current mechanism to monitor)
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   - 24 hour EEG completed: generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted.
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; likely
   contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine trending to 1.8 (from baseline 1.0), improved from
   [**5-3**]. Most likely due to poor renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given
   very low urine Na concern for development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   - Discuss with family goals of care, CVVH likely not a viable option
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG showing generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp, but
   low.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   - Bear hugger if temps stay low
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   - Check bladder pressure (trending down)
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AED
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.
   .
   # FEN: albumin for SBP / replete lytes prn / continue TF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a complex medical history, including Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and recent SBP and seizures. She is currently in the ICU with altered mental status, intubated, and on pressor support.

The patient's lab results show worsening renal function, with a creatinine trending to 1.8, and a FeNa of 0.3, which suggests a high likelihood of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Her urine output is low, and she is at risk of developing HRS. Her electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hyponatremia and hypokalemia.

The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to her altered mental status, and she is on mechanical ventilation with a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Her chest X-ray shows a possible right lower lobe opacity, which may be indicative of pneumonia.

The patient's neurological status is also concerning, with altered mental status, seizures, and encephalopathy. Her EEG shows generalized epileptiform discharges consistent with non-convulsive status, and she may be at risk of further seizures.

The patient's cardiovascular status is also compromised, with a high central venous pressure (CVP) and a low blood pressure. She is on pressor support with levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of >75.

The patient's abdominal examination shows ascites and mild peripheral edema, which may be indicative of liver failure.

The patient's skin examination shows jaundice and pitting edema, which may be indicative of liver failure and hypoalbuminemia.

The patient's medical history is complex, with a history of SBP, ESBL UTI, and HIV. She has also had recent antibiotic use, including vancomycin and meropenem.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, meropenem, and pantoprazole, and she is also receiving lactulose and albumin.

The patient's plan of care includes continued pressor support with levophed, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and close monitoring of her urine output and electrolyte levels. She will also be followed closely for signs of further liver failure and sepsis.

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

* Further deterioration of her renal function and development of HRS
* Development of sepsis or septic shock
* Further neurological deterioration and development of seizures or encephalopathy
* Development of respiratory failure and need for further mechanical ventilation
* Development of cardiovascular instability and need for further pressor support
* Development of liver failure and need for further liver support measures
* Development of electrolyte imbalances and need for further electrolyte replacement
* Development of skin and soft tissue infections

Overall, this patient requires close monitoring and management of her complex medical condition, and further evaluation and treatment of her underlying causes."

   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP.   Increased pressor requirement overnight
   to maintain MAP > 75 but this AM narrow complex tachycardia with rate
   to 140s possibly due to increased levophed.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.

As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome with
   worsening renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP.   Increased pressor requirement overnight
   to maintain MAP > 75 but this AM narrow complex tachycardia with rate
   to 140s possibly due to increased levophed.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12 (though no current mechanism to monitor)
   - levophed to MAP >65 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   - 24 hour EEG completed: generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted.
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; likely
   contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine trending to 1.8 (from baseline 1.0), improved from
   [**5-3**]. Most likely due to poor renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given
   very low urine Na concern for development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   - Discuss with family goals of care, CVVH likely not a viable option
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG showing generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp, but
   low.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   - Bear hugger if temps stay low
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.  Per hepatology
   likely not candidate for transplant at this time.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   - Check bladder pressure (trending down)
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AED
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, HIV, and recent SBP who is being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status. She has worsening renal function, likely due to hepatorenal syndrome, and is requiring increasing doses of levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 75. She is intubated due to altered mental status and concern for airway protection. Her lab results show a creatinine trending to 1.8, low urine output, and a FeNa of 0.3. She has a positive BCx and GPC in clusters, likely a contaminant. She is being treated with vancomycin and meropenem empirically.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): The patient's worsening renal function and low urine output suggest HRS, which is a life-threatening complication of liver disease.
2. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status, fever, and positive BCx and GPC in clusters suggest sepsis.
3. ARDS: The patient's intubation and respiratory status compromised due to mental status suggest ARDS.
4. Seizures: The patient's seizure disorder and EEG showing generalized epileptiform discharges suggest a risk of further seizures.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia and low urine output suggest a risk of further electrolyte imbalances.
6. Hypothermia: The patient's low body temperature and possible infected status suggest a risk of further hypothermia.
7. Cholestatsis: The patient's worsening bilirubinemia and possible cholestatsis suggest a risk of further liver failure.
8. Hx SBP: The patient's hx of SBP and altered mental status suggest a risk of new infection.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's renal function and urine output closely to prevent further worsening of HRS.
2. Continue treatment with vancomycin and meropenem empirically to cover possible sepsis.
3. Consider further diagnostic testing, such as a CT head, to rule out other causes of altered mental status.
4. Monitor the patient's seizure disorder and consider further treatment options, such as anticonvulsants.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and correct any imbalances promptly.
6. Monitor the patient's body temperature and consider further treatment options, such as bear hugger, if hypothermia persists.
7. Continue to trend the patient's LFTs and coags to monitor for further liver failure.
8. Consider further treatment options, such as albumin and octreotide, to treat possible HRS."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

Patient's Condition:

* Septic shock due to c-diff infection, requiring increasing doses of norepinephrine
* Hypotension, with a blood pressure of 115/65 mmHg
* Tachycardia, with a heart rate of 137 bpm
* Hypothermia, with a temperature of 36.9°C
* Respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O
* Acute on chronic renal failure, with a creatinine trending upwards and minimal urine output
* Hyponatremia, with a sodium level of 124 mmol/L
* Altered mental status, likely due to medications and sepsis
* Liver failure, with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels

Potential Medical Complications:

* Further deterioration of septic shock, leading to multi-organ failure
* Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy and platelet dysfunction
* Worsening of renal function, potentially requiring dialysis
* Development of liver failure, potentially requiring liver transplantation
* Increased risk of secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs)
* Potential for cardiac arrhythmias and ischemia due to hypotension and sepsis
* Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to coagulopathy and platelet dysfunction

Assessment and Plan:

* The patient's septic shock is being managed with antibiotics, vasopressors, and supportive care
* The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with mechanical ventilation and PEEP
* The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is being managed with IVF boluses and close monitoring of creatinine and urine output
* The patient's hyponatremia is being managed with fluid restriction and close monitoring of electrolyte levels
* The patient's altered mental status is being managed with sedation and close monitoring of neurological status
* The patient's liver failure is being managed with supportive care and close monitoring of liver enzymes and bilirubin levels

Goals of Care:

* The patient's prognosis is worsening, and it is essential to discuss goals of care with the patient and family
* The patient's care plan should prioritize symptom management, infection control, and supportive care to improve the patient's quality of life."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch tall, 100 kg male who is intubated and dependent on levophed infusion to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. The patient is icteric with low urine output (10-20 cc/hr) and continues to receive IV fluids.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 97/52 mmHg, and SpO2 of 96%. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute and a peak airway pressure of 16 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, and mild elevation of liver enzymes, including AST and ALT. The patient's kidney function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL.

The patient is at risk for potential medical complications, including:

1. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's dependence on levophed infusion to maintain MAP above 65 mmHg suggests that the patient may be at risk for cardiovascular instability, particularly if the infusion rate is increased or decreased too rapidly.
2. Kidney injury: The patient's low urine output and impaired kidney function suggest that the patient may be at risk for further kidney injury, particularly if the patient continues to receive nephrotoxic medications or has inadequate fluid resuscitation.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's requirement for mechanical ventilation and the presence of diffuse rhonchi on lung examination suggest that the patient may be at risk for respiratory failure, particularly if the patient's underlying lung disease worsens or if the patient develops pneumonia.
4. Sepsis: The patient's icteric appearance and low urine output suggest that the patient may be at risk for sepsis, particularly if the patient has a underlying infection or if the patient's immune system is compromised.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant medications and the presence of diffuse bleeding on skin examination suggest that the patient may be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly if the patient has an underlying bleeding disorder or if the patient's platelet count is low.

Based on these potential complications, it is recommended that the patient continue to receive close monitoring and management in the ICU, with frequent assessment of vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory and cardiovascular status. Additionally, the patient should receive prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia, and the patient's family should be educated on the patient's condition and treatment plan."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch tall male weighing 100 kg, who is intubated and mechanically ventilated with a FiO2 of 40%. He has been in the ICU for an unknown duration and has a history of sepsis, with multiple antibiotics being administered, including vancomycin and meropenem.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 97/52 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 32 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 96%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 15.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 39. His blood urea nitrogen is 23.8 mg/dL, and his creatinine is 1.6 mg/dL. His liver function tests show elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase.

The patient's medical history is significant for a history of sulfa allergy, angioedema, and hives. He has also had a previous episode of acute kidney injury.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and respiratory failure.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation may increase his risk of developing VAP.
3. Catheter-related bloodstream infections: The patient's central venous catheter and arterial line may be at risk for developing bloodstream infections.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's prolonged immobility may increase his risk of developing DVT.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness may lead to stress ulcer, which can cause gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure may progress to ARDS, which can be life-threatening.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia and narrow complex tachycardia may increase his risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Hypoglycemia: The patient's prolonged hyperglycemia may increase his risk of developing hypoglycemia.
9. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to renal failure, which can be life-threatening.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to identify any potential complications and adjust his treatment plan accordingly."

   45 y/o F with hx of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome with
   worsening renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.4 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Previously more
   interactive with higher MAP.   Increased pressor requirement overnight
   to maintain MAP > 75 but this AM narrow complex tachycardia with rate
   to 140s possibly due to increased levophed.
   - Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - Monitor volume status closely to avoid further fluid overload
 avoid
   IVF as minimal UOP
   - CVP 8-12 (though no current mechanism to monitor)
   - continue levophed to MAP >65 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  The differential includes seizure/post-ictal,
   hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia , medication induced
   (started following ativan administration).   CT head with no evidence
   of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent with encephalopathy
   with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common causes.  Cannot
   exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy and uremia.  CXR
   on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.
   - 24 hour EEG completed: generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted.
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; likely
   contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine ranging from 1.8  to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0) and
   continues to have low urine output (10-25cc/hr). The differential
   includes poor renal perfusion, possibly ATN vs. HRS. Given very low
   urine Na concern for development of HRS.  Renal evaluation over the
   weekend noted that renal replacement therapy will not be an option.
   Bladder pressures 24 today.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - monitor bladder pressure
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   consider bolus if < 20 cc/hr
   - F/U renal and liver recs regarding treatment for HRS
   - monitor bladder pressure
   .
   # SVT: Patient had episode of regular narrow complex tachycardia on
   [**2200-5-3**] likely PSVT, broke spontaneously.  Possibly due to increasing
   levophed requirement to maintain MAP >75.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - lower MAP requirement to >65 (from >75)
   - adenosine at bedside
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG showing generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted
   - MRI when stable
   - neurology recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp, but
   low.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   - Bear hugger for low temperature
   .
   # Hepatitis C Cirrhosis:  She continues to be anicteric with a
   worsening INR and liver function tests and a MELD today of 44.
   Per hepatology likely not candidate for transplant at this time.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   -  re-check bedside US today and consider diagnostic and therapeutic
   paracentesis if sufficient ascites
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]

   # Anemia: slowly trending down with  guaiac + stool
   -  continue to monitor HCT (check PM)
   - consider transfusion for active bleed or HCT <24

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2200-5-4**] 11:15 AM
   - regular narrow complex tachycardia rate in 140s, likely PSVT, broke
   spontaneously. Adenosine at bed side. Possibly due to increased
   levophed requirement to maintain MAP >75. MAP goal reduced to >65
   verified w/ renal.
   - Remains dependent on levophed gtt, attempt to reduce dose but MAP <65
   so subsequently levophed gtt increased to 0.15mcg. Continues with low
   urine output (10-20cc/hr).
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**] attempted to discuss goals of care with family, but unable
   to get in touch.
   - No overnight events.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and recent SBP and seizures. She was transferred to the MICU with altered mental status and is currently intubated due to concern for airway protection. The patient has a range of complications, including shock, respiratory failure, altered mental status, seizures, and liver failure. She has a MELD score of 44, indicating a high risk of mortality.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Shock: The patient's shock appears to be intravascularly dry, and her increased pressor requirement may indicate ongoing hypovolemia. Close monitoring of volume status is essential to avoid further fluid overload.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and she requires mechanical ventilation. The differential diagnosis includes ARDS, and bronchoscopy has revealed mucous plugging and collapse.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is a concern, and the differential diagnosis includes seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia, and medication-induced encephalopathy.
4. Seizures: The patient's seizure disorder is unclear, but the differential diagnosis includes underlying organic seizure disorder, liver failure, and medication-induced encephalopathy.
5. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is deteriorating, and her MELD score is 44, indicating a high risk of mortality.
6. Hepato-Renal Syndrome: The patient's low urine output and high creatinine levels suggest the possibility of hepatorenal syndrome.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is a concern, and the differential diagnosis includes diuretic use, SIADH, and possible hepatorenal syndrome.
8. Infection: The patient's history of SBP and recent antibiotics use suggests the possibility of ongoing infection, and the patient's low platelet count may indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely secondary to liver disease, and close monitoring is essential to prevent bleeding.
10. Anemia: The patient's anemia is slowly trending down, and transfusion may be necessary for active bleeding or HCT <24.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's volume status closely to avoid further fluid overload.
2. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis and consider diagnostic paracentesis if tappable pocket.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider bronchoscopy to rule out ARDS.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's altered mental status and consider EEG to rule out seizure disorder.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and consider liver transplantation if necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and consider dialysis if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusion if <10 or actively bleeding.
8. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider fluid restriction if necessary.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's temperature and consider empiric antibiotics if infected.
10. Consider family meeting to discuss patient's condition and prognosis."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome with
   worsening renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.4 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP.   Increased pressor requirement overnight
   to maintain MAP > 75 but this AM narrow complex tachycardia with rate
   to 140s possibly due to increased levophed.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12 (though no current mechanism to monitor)
   - continue levophed to MAP >65 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  The differential includes seizure/post-ictal,
   hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia , medication induced
   (started following ativan administration).   CT head with no evidence
   of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent with encephalopathy
   with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common causes.  Cannot
   exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy and uremia.  CXR
   on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.
   - 24 hour EEG completed: generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted.
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; likely
   contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine ranging from 1.8  to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0) and
   continues to have low urine output (10-25cc/hr). The differential
   includes poor renal perfusion, possibly ATN vs. HRS. Given very low
   urine Na concern for development of HRS.  Renal evaluation over the
   weekend noted that renal replacement therapy will not be an option.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - monitor bladder pressure
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   consider bolus if < 20 cc/hr
   - F/U renal and liver recs regarding treatment for HRS
   - monitor bladder pressure
   .
   # SVT: Patient had episode of regular narrow complex tachycardia on
   [**2200-5-3**] likely PSVT, broke spontaneously.  Possibly due to increasing
   levophed requirement to maintain MAP >75.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - lower MAP requirement to >65 (from >75)
   - adenosine at bedside
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG showing generalized epileptiform discharges c/w

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome with
   worsening renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.4 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP.   Increased pressor requirement overnight
   to maintain MAP > 75 but this AM narrow complex tachycardia with rate
   to 140s possibly due to increased levophed.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12 (though no current mechanism to monitor)
   - continue levophed to MAP >65 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  The differential includes seizure/post-ictal,
   hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia , medication induced
   (started following ativan administration).   CT head with no evidence
   of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent with encephalopathy
   with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common causes.  Cannot
   exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy and uremia.  CXR
   on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.
   - 24 hour EEG completed: generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted.
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; likely
   contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine ranging from 1.8  to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0) and
   continues to have low urine output (10-25cc/hr). The differential
   includes poor renal perfusion, possibly ATN vs. HRS. Given very low
   urine Na concern for development of HRS.  Renal evaluation over the
   weekend noted that renal replacement therapy will not be an option.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - monitor bladder pressure
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   consider bolus if < 20 cc/hr
   - F/U renal and liver recs regarding treatment for HRS
   - monitor bladder pressure
   .
   # SVT: Patient had episode of regular narrow complex tachycardia on
   [**2200-5-3**] likely PSVT, broke spontaneously.  Possibly due to increasing
   levophed requirement to maintain MAP >75.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - lower MAP requirement to >65 (from >75)
   - adenosine at bedside
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG showing generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted
   - MRI when stable
   - neurology recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp, but
   low.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   - Bear hugger for low temperature
   .
   # Hepatitis C Cirrhosis:  She continues to be anicteric with a
   worsening INR and liver function tests and a MELD today of 44.
   Per hepatology likely not candidate for transplant at this time.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   -  re-check bedside US today and consider diagnostic and therapeutic
   paracentesis if sufficient ascites
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.  Multiple UA
   and cultures no growth to date.
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down with  guaiac + stool
   -  continue to monitor HCT
   - consider transfusion for active bleed or HCT <5
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and recent sepsis, who is being treated in the MICU for altered mental status, shock, respiratory failure, and other complications. She has a high risk of developing hepatorenal syndrome, and her creatinine levels are increasing. She has a history of SBP and ESBL UTI, and is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. She has a seizure disorder and is being monitored for further episodes. She has a low platelet count and is at risk for bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, and she has a high risk of developing hepatorenal syndrome, which can lead to further kidney damage and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, and her current condition is worsening, which can lead to further organ dysfunction and mortality.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and has a high risk of developing respiratory failure, which can lead to further complications and mortality.
4. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a seizure disorder, and further episodes can lead to further complications and mortality.
5. Bleeding: The patient has a low platelet count, and is at risk for bleeding, which can lead to further complications and mortality.
6. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing infection, particularly in the setting of her compromised immune system and recent antibiotic use.
7. Shock: The patient has a high risk of developing shock, particularly in the setting of her compromised cardiovascular system and recent fluid overload.
8. ARDS: The patient has a high risk of developing ARDS, particularly in the setting of her recent respiratory failure and sepsis.
9. HRS: The patient has a high risk of developing HRS, particularly in the setting of her compromised liver function and recent fluid overload.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's creatinine levels closely and adjust her fluid management accordingly to prevent further kidney damage.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust her ventilation settings accordingly to prevent further respiratory failure.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's seizure disorder closely and adjust her anticonvulsant therapy accordingly to prevent further episodes.
4. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk closely and adjust her platelet transfusion therapy accordingly to prevent further bleeding.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's infection risk closely and adjust her antibiotic therapy accordingly to prevent further infection.
6. Monitor the patient's shock risk closely and adjust her fluid management accordingly to prevent further shock.
7. Consider performing a diagnostic paracentesis to rule out infection as a cause of the patient's ascites.
8. Consider performing a bronchoscopy to rule out infection as a cause of the patient's respiratory failure.
9. Consider performing an MRI to rule out underlying organic seizure disorder."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with ESLD, HIV, and a history of encephalopathy, septic shock, and renal failure. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times and is currently experiencing respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute renal failure. She has a poor prognosis due to her underlying liver disease and is not a candidate for transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen due to her underlying liver disease and septic shock. There is a high risk of developing respiratory acidosis and hypoxia.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock is likely to progress due to her underlying liver disease and the lack of a definite source of infection. There is a high risk of developing multi-organ dysfunction, including cardiac, renal, and hepatic failure.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely to worsen due to her underlying liver disease and septic shock. There is a high risk of developing oliguria or anuria, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver disease is likely to cause ongoing encephalopathy, which can worsen her cognitive function and increase her risk of developing septic shock.
5. Infection: The patient's septic shock is likely to be caused by a bacterial infection, which can lead to further complications such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient's septic shock can lead to cardiac complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and heart failure.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's liver disease can cause ongoing gastrointestinal complications such as ascites, bleeding, and encephalopathy.
8. Hemorrhagic Complications: The patient's liver disease can cause ongoing hemorrhagic complications such as variceal bleeding and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Based on this summary and potential medical complications, the patient requires close monitoring and aggressive management of her respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal function. She also requires ongoing treatment for her septic shock and underlying liver disease."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Pt received cefepime accidental dose x 1 (another patient's
   medication). Has PCN allergy (hives) but no known anaphylaxis. No
   immediate rxn. No meds given at this time.
   - Discussed poor prognosis with son. Renal also discussed futility of
   RRT. Change in code status to DNR (ok to continue intubation, ok to
   continue pressors). Son contacting family for potential family meeting
   on Tuesday.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC; post-transfusion Hct - 24 (from 22)
   - Coags markedly worse with PM labs; son was called to notify him that
   patient's labs are becoming progressively unstable and that family
   meeting should not be detained until Friday as complications may arise
   before then. He will try to arrange for meeting tomorrow afternoon. Had
   Qs about meaning of ""CMO"" when this issue was raised; still seems very
   hesitant to change plan of care.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome with
   worsening renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Hepatitis C Cirrhosis with hepatic failure:  She continues to be
   grossly icteric with a worsening INR and liver function tests and a
   MELD today of 51. Vitamin K for elevated INR has not been helpful in
   lowering INR.  With new likely GIB noted on suctioning today, will
   likely need FFP/DDAVP depending on goals of  care.
   Per hepatology likely not candidate for transplant at this time.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue lactulose
   - 1PRBC, 1 unit platelets, 2 unit FFP as temporizing measure until
   goals of care re-addressed this afternoon
   - consider FFP/DDAVP for UGIB if goals of care remain the same.  Repeat
   HCT at 0900 this morning.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.4 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Previously more
   interactive with higher MAP.   Increased pressor requirement overnight
   with addition of an additional pressor.
   - Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - Monitor volume status closely to avoid further fluid overload
 avoid
   IVF as minimal UOP
   - continue levophed/vasopressin to MAP >65 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - if MAP continues to decline will add neosynephrine
   - ABG at noon, if pH <7.2 then consider bicarbonate
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   # Goals of Care: patient
s hepatic failure continues to worsen as
   evidenced by worsening t. bili and INR.  Extremely unlikely that
   patient will recover from this illness.
   - Arrange family meeting as expeditiously as possible to address goals
   of care.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  The differential includes seizure/post-ictal,
   hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia , medication induced
   (started following ativan administration).   CT head with no evidence
   of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent with encephalopathy
   with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common causes.  Cannot
   exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy and uremia.  CXR
   on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.
   - 24 hour EEG completed: generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted.
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; likely
   contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine ranging from 1.8  to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0) and
   continues to have low urine output (10-25cc/hr). The differential
   includes poor renal perfusion, possibly ATN vs. HRS. Given very low
   urine Na concern for development of HRS.  Renal evaluation over the
   weekend noted that renal replacement therapy will not be an option.
   Bladder pressures 24 today.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - monitor bladder pressure
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal and liver recs regarding treatment for HRS
   .
   # SVT: Patient had episode of regular narrow complex tachycardia on
   [**2200-5-3**] likely PSVT, broke spontaneously.  Possibly due to increasing
   levophed requirement to maintain MAP >75.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - lower MAP requirement to >65 (from >75)
   - adenosine at bedside
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG showing generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted
   - MRI if stable
   - neurology recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp, but
   low.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   - Bear hugger prn for low temperature
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   -  re-check bedside US today and consider diagnostic and therapeutic
   paracentesis if sufficient ascites
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.  Multiple UA
   and cultures no growth to date.
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down with  guaiac + stool
   -  continue to monitor HCT (check PM)
   - consider transfusion for active bleed or HCT <24
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.
   .
   # FEN: albumin for SBP / replete lytes prn / continue TF
   # PPX: PPI IV, pneumoboots given thrombocytopenia, bowel regimen
   # ACCESS: PICC (will hold off on CVL for today)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Pt received cefepime accidental dose x 1 (another patient's
   medication). Has PCN allergy (hives) but no known anaphylaxis. No
   immediate rxn. No meds given at this time.
   - Discussed poor prognosis with son. Renal also discussed futility of
   RRT. Change in code status to DNR (ok to continue intubation, ok to
   continue pressors). Son contacting family for potential family meeting
   on Tuesday.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC; post-transfusion Hct - 24 (from 22)
   - Coags markedly worse with PM labs; son was called to notify him that
   patient's labs are becoming progressively unstable and that family
   meeting should not be detained until Friday as complications may arise
   before then. He will try to arrange for meeting tomorrow afternoon. Had
   Qs about meaning of ""CMO"" when this issue was raised; still seems very
   hesitant to change plan of care.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, and HIV. She is currently in the ICU with worsening renal function, sepsis, and altered mental status. She has received an accidental dose of cefepime, which she is allergic to, and has a PCN allergy with no known anaphylaxis. She has also had seizures, possibly secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, and has a history of SBP and ESBL UTI. Her liver function tests and coagulation studies are worsening, and her INR is 51. She is intubated and on pressors, and her family has been notified of her poor prognosis and the possibility of futility of RRT.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function tests and INR are worsening, indicating further deterioration of her liver function. This may lead to increased risk of bleeding, encephalopathy, and death.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely secondary to her underlying liver disease and may worsen her renal function and increase her risk of bleeding.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine is rising, and she has low urine output, indicating worsening renal function. This may lead to further deterioration of her renal function and increased risk of bleeding.
4. Bleeding: The patient's liver disease and coagulopathy may increase her risk of bleeding, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.
5. Infection: The patient's history of SBP and ESBL UTI, along with her altered mental status and sepsis, increase her risk of developing further infections.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's intubation and pressors may not be sufficient to maintain her respiratory function, and she may require further interventions to maintain her oxygenation.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's pressors may not be sufficient to maintain her blood pressure, and she may require further interventions to maintain her cardiovascular stability.
8. Neurological instability: The patient's altered mental status and seizures may worsen her neurological function, and she may require further interventions to manage her seizures and maintain her neurological stability.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function tests and INR to assess the progression of her liver disease.
2. Continue to manage the patient's sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics and pressors.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and consider further interventions to improve her renal function, such as RRT.
4. Continue to manage the patient's bleeding risk with platelet transfusions and anticoagulation therapy.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory function and consider further interventions to improve her oxygenation, such as non-invasive ventilation.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular stability and consider further interventions to improve her blood pressure, such as vasopressors.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological function and consider further interventions to manage her seizures, such as anticonvulsants.
8. Consider a family meeting to discuss the patient's poor prognosis and the possibility of futility of RRT."

   - Pt received cefepime accidental dose x 1 (another patient's
   medication). Has PCN allergy (hives) but no known anaphylaxis. No
   immediate rxn. No meds given at this time.
   - Discussed poor prognosis with son. Renal also discussed futility of
   RRT. Change in code status to DNR (ok to continue intubation, ok to
   continue pressors). Son contacting family for potential family meeting
   on Tuesday.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC; post-transfusion Hct - 24 (from 22)
   - Coags markedly worse with PM labs; son was called to notify him that
   patient's labs are becoming progressively unstable and that family
   meeting should not be detained until Friday as complications may arise
   before then. He will try to arrange for meeting tomorrow afternoon. Had
   Qs about meaning of ""CMO"" when this issue was raised; still seems very

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome with
   worsening renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Hepatitis C Cirrhosis with hepatic failure:  She continues to be
   grossly icteric with a worsening INR and liver function tests and a
   MELD today of 51. Vitamin K for elevated INR has not been helpful in
   lowering INR.  With new likely GIB noted on suctioning today, will
   likely need FFP/DDAVP depending on goals of  care.
   Per hepatology likely not candidate for transplant at this time.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue lactulose
   - consider FFP/DDAVP for UGIB if goals of care remain the same.  Repeat
   HCT at 0900 this morning.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.4 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Previously more
   interactive with higher MAP.   Increased pressor requirement overnight
   with addition of an additional pressor.
   - Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - Monitor volume status closely to avoid further fluid overload
 avoid
   IVF as minimal UOP
   - continue levophed/vasopressin to MAP >65 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   # Goals of Care: patient
s hepatic failure continues to worsen as
   evidenced by worsening t. bili and INR.  Extremely unlikely that
   patient will recover from this illness.
   - Arrange family meeting as expeditiously as possible to address goals
   of care.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  The differential includes seizure/post-ictal,
   hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia , medication induced
   (started following ativan administration).   CT head with no evidence
   of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent with encephalopathy
   with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common causes.  Cannot
   exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy and uremia.  CXR
   on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.
   - 24 hour EEG completed: generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted.

   continues to have low urine output (10-25cc/hr). The differential
   includes poor renal perfusion, possibly ATN vs. HRS. Given very low
   urine Na concern for development of HRS.  Renal evaluation over the

   # SVT: Patient had episode of regular narrow complex tachycardia on
   [**2200-5-3**] likely PSVT, broke spontaneously.  Possibly due to increasing
   levophed requirement to maintain MAP >75.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - lower MAP requirement to >65 (from >75)
   - adenosine at bedside
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG showing generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted
   - MRI if stable
   - neurology recommending no AED at this time

   low.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   - Bear hugger prn for low temperature
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Pt received cefepime accidental dose x 1 (another patient's
   medication). Has PCN allergy (hives) but no known anaphylaxis. No
   immediate rxn. No meds given at this time.
   - Discussed poor prognosis with son. Renal also discussed futility of
   RRT. Change in code status to DNR (ok to continue intubation, ok to
   continue pressors). Son contacting family for potential family meeting
   on Tuesday.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC; post-transfusion Hct - 24 (from 22)
   - Coags markedly worse with PM labs; son was called to notify him that
   patient's labs are becoming progressively unstable and that family
   meeting should not be detained until Friday as complications may arise
   before then. He will try to arrange for meeting tomorrow afternoon. Had
   Qs about meaning of ""CMO"" when this issue was raised; still seems very
   hesitant to change plan of care.
   - Few hundred cc's of guaiac-positive maroon fluid removed from stomach
   through NGT at ~5:30 am during routine flush; Hct ordered for 9:00 AM

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome with
   worsening renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Hepatitis C Cirrhosis with hepatic failure:  She continues to be
   grossly icteric with a worsening INR and liver function tests and a
   MELD today of 51. Vitamin K for elevated INR has not been helpful in
   lowering INR.  With new likely GIB noted on suctioning today, will
   likely need FFP/DDAVP depending on goals of  care.
   Per hepatology likely not candidate for transplant at this time.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue lactulose
   - consider FFP/DDAVP for UGIB if goals of care remain the same.  Repeat
   HCT at 0900 this morning.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.4 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Previously more
   interactive with higher MAP.   Increased pressor requirement overnight
   with addition of an additional pressor.
   - Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - Monitor volume status closely to avoid further fluid overload
 avoid
   IVF as minimal UOP
   - continue levophed/vasopressin to MAP >65 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   # Goals of Care: patient
s hepatic failure continues to worsen as
   evidenced by worsening t. bili and INR.  Extremely unlikely that
   patient will recover from this illness.
   - Arrange family meeting as expeditiously as possible to address goals
   of care.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  The differential includes seizure/post-ictal,
   hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia , medication induced
   (started following ativan administration).   CT head with no evidence
   of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent with encephalopathy
   with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common causes.  Cannot
   exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy and uremia.  CXR
   on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.
   - 24 hour EEG completed: generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted.
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; likely
   contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine ranging from 1.8  to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0) and
   continues to have low urine output (10-25cc/hr). The differential
   includes poor renal perfusion, possibly ATN vs. HRS. Given very low
   urine Na concern for development of HRS.  Renal evaluation over the
   weekend noted that renal replacement therapy will not be an option.
   Bladder pressures 24 today.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - monitor bladder pressure
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal and liver recs regarding treatment for HRS
   .
   # SVT: Patient had episode of regular narrow complex tachycardia on
   [**2200-5-3**] likely PSVT, broke spontaneously.  Possibly due to increasing
   levophed requirement to maintain MAP >75.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - lower MAP requirement to >65 (from >75)
   - adenosine at bedside
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG showing generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted
   - MRI if stable
   - neurology recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp, but
   low.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   - Bear hugger prn for low temperature
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   -  re-check bedside US today and consider diagnostic and therapeutic
   paracentesis if sufficient ascites
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.  Multiple UA
   and cultures no growth to date.
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down with  guaiac + stool
   -  continue to monitor HCT (check PM)
   - consider transfusion for active bleed or HCT <24
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.
   .
   # FEN: albumin for SBP / replete lytes prn / continue TF

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and recent SBP and seizures. She is being treated in the MICU with altered mental status, and her condition is rapidly deteriorating.

The patient has a number of significant medical issues, including:

1. Hepatic failure: Her liver function tests are worsening, and her MELD score is 51, indicating a high risk of mortality.
2. Shock: The patient appears to be in intravascular shock, with a low blood pressure and high vasopressor requirements.
3. Respiratory failure: She is intubated due to altered mental status and concern for airway protection, and may have ARDS.
4. Renal failure: The patient has acute kidney injury, with a creatinine of 1.8-2.4 and low urine output.
5. Seizures: She has had multiple seizures, and her EEG shows generalized epileptiform discharges consistent with non-convulsive status.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient has had hyponatremia, which has been corrected with hypertonic saline.
7. Thrombocytopenia: She has a low platelet count, likely secondary to liver disease.
8. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, likely secondary to chronic disease.
9. HIV: She is HIV-positive, with a CD4 count in the 600s.

The patient's medical team is considering the following potential medical complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of SBP and may be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture and may be at risk for sepsis.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient has a high risk of developing hepatorenal syndrome, given her worsening liver function and renal failure.
4. ARF: The patient may be at risk for acute renal failure, given her low urine output and worsening renal function.
5. Seizure disorder: The patient may have a seizure disorder, given her multiple seizures and EEG findings.

The patient's family has been notified of her poor prognosis, and a family meeting has been arranged to discuss her goals of care. The patient's code status is DNR, and she is being treated with pressors to maintain her blood pressure.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis.
2. Monitoring her liver function and renal function closely.
3. Managing her shock with vasopressors and fluid resuscitation.
4. Continuing to treat her seizures with anticonvulsants.
5. Monitoring her electrolyte levels closely.
6. Considering the use of albumin and octreotide to treat her hyponatremia and liver failure.
7. Continuing to monitor her platelet count and transfusing platelets if necessary.
8. Considering the use of DDAVP to treat her thrombocytopenia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with ESLD, HIV, and worsening septic shock. She is currently on increasing doses of pressors and has been diagnosed with multi-organ system failure, including renal failure, liver failure, and respiratory failure. She has also developed gastrointestinal bleeding and has been experiencing altered mental status. The patient's family has been informed of her condition and has agreed to limit care, pending further discussions with other family members.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Progressive multi-organ system failure: The patient's condition is worsening, and she is at risk of further deterioration, which can lead to increased morbidity and mortality.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and she may require dialysis to manage her renal failure.
3. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and she may require liver transplantation or other interventions to manage her liver failure.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation and may require further interventions, such as tracheostomy or non-invasive ventilation, to manage her respiratory failure.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to further complications, such as hemorrhagic shock or perforation.
6. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which can make it difficult to manage her care and communicate with her.
7. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis, which can lead to further complications, such as organ failure or death.
8. Infections: The patient is at risk of developing further infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections, which can worsen her condition.
9. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is abnormal, which can lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or renal failure.
10. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which can lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications. Her family has been informed of her condition and has agreed to limit care, pending further discussions with other family members."
