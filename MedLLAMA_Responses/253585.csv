   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Femoral catheter pulled without incident, no residual hematoma.  Pt
   denied further episodes of chest pain, had some back pain which
   resolved.  Weaned off nitro gtt.  No longer on integrilin this AM.
   Overnight, had Foley catheter placed with some resistance, blood in
   tube and abdominal pain.  Foley pulled and bladder scan showed ~600cc
   urine.  Urology was called and they recommended a Coude catheter.  This
   was placed and urine drained which was red in color.  Continues to
   drain red urine.  Pt denies further pain.
   ROS otherwise negative for chest pain, SOB, back pain, diaphoresis, N/V
   or abdominal pain.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of CAD, who presented with NSTEMI and continued chest and back pain. He was found to have LMCA and RCA lesions, and underwent stenting. Cardiac enzymes have peaked and are trending down. The patient is currently on aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor, and Metoprolol, and is being monitored for cardiac function. He has developed urinary retention likely secondary to BPH, and is being managed with a Coude catheter. The patient also has anemia, which is being monitored, and is on Terazosin for BPH.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Heart failure due to prolonged hypotension and decreased cardiac function
	* Arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia
	* Cardiac tamponade due to bleeding or perforation of the heart
2. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury due to hypotension, dehydration, or contrast-induced nephropathy
	* Chronic kidney disease due to underlying conditions or medications
3. Neurological Complications:
	* Cerebral edema or hemorrhage due to hypotension or bleeding
	* Seizures or encephalopathy due to hypoxia, hypercapnia, or medication toxicity
4. Respiratory Complications:
	* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to hypotension, aspiration, or pneumonia
	* Pneumonia or respiratory failure due to aspiration or infection
5. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to anticoagulation or underlying conditions
	* Pancreatitis or cholecystitis due to gallstones or medication toxicity
6. Hematological Complications:
	* Bleeding or hemolytic anemia due to anticoagulation or underlying conditions
	* Thrombocytopenia or leukopenia due to medication toxicity or underlying conditions
7. Infection:
	* Sepsis or septic shock due to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or other infections
	* Meningitis or encephalitis due to bacterial or viral infections

It is essential to monitor the patient closely for any signs of these potential complications and to adjust treatment accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of NSTEMI and continued chest and back pain. He has a history of CAD and has undergone coronary stenting for LMCA and RCA lesions. He is currently receiving various medications, including nitroglycerin, integrillin, aspirin, Plavix, high-dose statin, and beta-blocker. He is also receiving ACEI as tolerated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98°F, heart rate of 67 bpm, and blood pressure of 113/59 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula. His physical examination is unremarkable, with no signs of cardiac or respiratory distress.

Laboratory results show elevated cardiac enzymes, with troponin-T levels of 0.92 ng/mL and CK-MB levels of 29 U/L. His complete blood count shows a white blood cell count of 5.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 175 K/uL.

The patient's medical history is significant for CAD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and rheumatoid arthritis. He is also taking medications for BPH and Parkinson's disease.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and NSTEMI puts him at risk for cardiac complications, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient's use of heparin and integrillin increases his risk of bleeding complications, including hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 40 to 32.6, which may be due to bleeding or other causes. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of anemia.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, which may be due to his underlying cardiac condition or other factors. Close monitoring is needed to ensure adequate oxygenation.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of Parkinson's disease and use of sinemet increases his risk of neurological complications, including dyskinesias and hallucinations.
6. Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine level may indicate kidney damage or dysfunction, which may worsen with continued use of nephrotoxic medications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and troponin-T levels to assess for cardiac complications.
2. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust his anticoagulant therapy as needed.
3. Evaluate the patient's anemia and determine the cause, if possible.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation to ensure adequate oxygenation.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his sinemet dosage as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his medications as needed to minimize nephrotoxicity."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of CAD who presents with NSTEMI and continued chest and back pain. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving treatment for his conditions.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°F, heart rate of 60-91 bpm, blood pressure of 91/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. His heart rhythm is normal sinus rhythm.

The patient has a Foley catheter in place and is experiencing significant hematuria, which is being managed with irrigation and clot removal every 4 hours. He is also experiencing suprapubic discomfort, which is being managed with flushing every 4 hours.

The patient has a history of BPH and is taking Terazosin as per his home dose. He is also taking Metoprolol 25mg PO BID for his CAD.

The patient's laboratory results show that his hemoglobin is 11.6 g/dL, hematocrit is 33.9%, and platelet count is 157 K/uL. His troponin-T is 0.83 ng/mL, and his creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL.

The patient's medical conditions include CAD, NSTEMI, BPH, and rheumatoid arthritis. He is also taking medications for his conditions, including aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor, and Metoprolol.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Continued bleeding from the Foley catheter, which may lead to hypovolemic shock.
2. Development of a urinary tract infection due to the presence of a Foley catheter.
3. Prolonged hematuria, which may lead to anemia and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Hypotension due to the patient's CAD and NSTEMI, which may lead to decreased perfusion to vital organs.
5. Development of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to the patient's CAD and NSTEMI, which may lead to pulmonary embolism.
6. Prolonged hospitalization due to the patient's complex medical conditions, which may lead to increased risk of hospital-acquired infections and other complications.
7. Development of a pressure ulcer due to prolonged bedrest and immobility.
8. Prolonged use of antibiotics, which may lead to antibiotic resistance and increased risk of antibiotic-associated side effects.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   77M with CAD who presents with NSTEMI and continued chest and back
   pain.
   .
   # CORONARIES: CP today although similar in character to presentation
   initially, upon further questioning similar to spinal pain.  No
   trauma.  Feel this is most likely musculoskeletal in origin, but  given
   similar sx to anginal equivalent, will cycle cardiac enzymes.  Unlikely
   intrastent thrombosis given lack of STelevations.  Initially presented
   with NSTEMI (vs STEMI) found to have LMCA lesion (Cypher stent placed),
   90% diag (minivision stent placed) and RCA lesion (50-60%; not
   stented).
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - 250cc bolus s/p NTG to maintain BPs
   - Pain control w/ IV morphine, OOB and PT
   - Continue with aspirin, plavix, Lipitor 80mg and Metoprolol 25mg PO
   BID
   - holding on ACE due to hypotension, will restart once CP controlled
   and no SBPs > 110 systolic.
   - will need lifetime Plavix, given ASA, Plavix, will continue
   Ranitidine
   .
   # BACK PAIN: Likely anginal equivalent but also possible [**2-28**] spinal
   stenosis.  Cycling enzymes as above.  Morphine for pain control for
   now.  OOB/PT.  will reassess if continued poor control.
   .
   # PUMP:  Euvolemic on exam, LVEF 50% w/ septal hypertrophy and mild
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with probable mid to
   distal anterior hypokinesis.  Consistent w/ Cath.
   -          Continued BBK, no lasix for now
   -          Will need to start ACE-I as soon as BPs tolerate.
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR, monitor on tele.
   .
   # ANEMIA: HCT dropped 40 to 32.6 from OSH to now, but has been stable
   32-34.   No GI source of bleeding.   Hematuria, now improving (see
   below).
   -          HCT stable, continue to trend
   -          Guiac all stools
   .
   # Urinary Retention: likely secondary to BPH.  Pt is on Terazosin as
   per home dose.  Has never taken Finasteride.  Does not have outpatient
   urologist.  Has traumatic foley placement, now w/ Coude catheter and
   requiring irrigation Q3-4hrs for UOP, removing frequent clots.  Pt. w/
   one episode of suprapubic pain, did not require Detrol.
   - Discussed w/ urology will see him today, will likely perform a
   voiding trial.
   - continue Terazosin
   .

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   No cardiac Sx.  Was called out, but no bed available.  Continued to
   have significant hematuria.  Pt. required irrigation w/ NS Q4h with
   continued clot removal.  Had an episode on suprapubic discomfort
   for several minutes.  Pt. requires flushing Q4h for continued UOP,
   foley in correct place.  Discussed w/ Urology, they recommended
   continuing as we are, if pain persists, can start detrol 5mg tid (pt
   was asleep, so did not start).  They will see him in AM.  HCT stable at
   32-33.
   This AM pt. developed chest pain (central) and back pain, similar to
   pain on  presentation/cath course in character but lower in intensity
   5/10max.  On further questioning, pt has had similar pain PTA for many
   months. VS were wnl.  ECG showed new TwI in V2,4, w/ no other
   abnormalities.  Pt. was given SLNitro x3 w/ reduction in pain to [**2-5**]
   then complete resolution after morphine 1mg x1.  ECG when CP free w/
   biphasic Tw in V2,4

   Assessment and Plan
   77M with CAD who presents with NSTEMI and continued chest and back
   pain.
   .
   # CORONARIES: CP today although similar in character to presentation
   initially, upon further questioning similar to spinal pain.  No
   trauma.  Feel this is most likely musculoskeletal in origin, but  given
   similar sx to anginal equivalent, will cycle cardiac enzymes.  Unlikely
   intrastent thrombosis given lack of STelevations.  Initially presented
   with NSTEMI (vs STEMI) found to have LMCA lesion (Cypher stent placed),
   90% diag (minivision stent placed) and RCA lesion (50-60%; not
   stented).
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - 250cc bolus s/p NTG to maintain BPs
   - Pain control w/ IV morphine, OOB and PT
   - Continue with aspirin, plavix, Lipitor 80mg and Metoprolol 25mg PO
   BID
   - holding on ACE due to hypotension, will restart once CP controlled
   and no SBPs > 110 systolic.
   - will need lifetime Plavix, given ASA, Plavix, will continue
   Ranitidine
   .
   # BACK PAIN: Likely anginal equivalent but also possible [**2-28**] spinal
   stenosis.  Cycling enzymes as above.  Morphine for pain control for
   now.  OOB/PT.  will reassess if continued poor control.
   .
   # PUMP:  Euvolemic on exam, LVEF 50% w/ septal hypertrophy and mild
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with probable mid to
   distal anterior hypokinesis.  Consistent w/ Cath.
   -          Continued BBK, no lasix for now
   -          Will need to start ACE-I as soon as BPs tolerate.
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR, monitor on tele.
   .
   # ANEMIA: HCT dropped 40 to 32.6 from OSH to now, but has been stable
   32-34.   No GI source of bleeding.   Hematuria, now improving (see
   below).
   -          HCT stable, continue to trend
   -          Guiac all stools
   .
   # Urinary Retention: likely secondary to BPH.  Pt is on Terazosin as
   per home dose.  Has never taken Finasteride.  Does not have outpatient
   urologist.  Has traumatic foley placement, now w/ Coude catheter and
   requiring irrigation Q3-4hrs for UOP, removing frequent clots.  Pt. w/
   one episode of suprapubic pain, did not require Detrol.
   - Discussed w/ urology will see him today, will likely perform a
   voiding trial.
   - continue Terazosin
   .
   # PARKINSONS:  Consider sinemet.
   .
   #. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS:  On MTX at home; will hold this in the
   short-term though will need to be restarted long-term.
   .
   # FEN: Cardiac diet
   # ACCESS: PIV's
   # PROPHYLAXIS: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis
   # CODE: Full code; discussed with patient and family at time of
   admission to CCU
   # DISPO: Call out to floor now chest pain free

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of CAD who presented with NSTEMI and continued chest and back pain. The patient's chest pain is similar in character to his presentation, initially, upon further questioning, similar to spinal pain. The patient has a LMCA lesion (Cypher stent placed), 90% diagonal lesion (minivision stent placed), and RCA lesion (50-60%; not stented).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Stable, with a temperature of 98.4°F, heart rate of 60-91 bpm, blood pressure of 91/53-135/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.
* Physical examination: The patient is an elderly male in no acute distress, oriented x3, with a flat face, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and no murmurs or gallop.
* Lab results: The patient's lab results show an elevated troponin-T level of 0.83 ng/mL, a decreased hemoglobin level of 11.6 g/dL, and an elevated white blood cell count of 5.8 K/uL.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* CAD
* NSTEMI
* LMCA lesion (Cypher stent placed)
* Diagonal lesion (minivision stent placed)
* RCA lesion (50-60%; not stented)
* BPH
* Hematuria
* Anemia
* Parkinson's disease
* Rheumatoid arthritis

The patient's medications include:

* Aspirin
* Plavix
* Lipitor 80mg
* Metoprolol 25mg PO BID
* Ranitidine
* Terazosin
* Sinemet (considered for Parkinson's disease)
* MTX (held short-term, but will need to be restarted long-term)

The patient's plan includes:

* Cycling cardiac enzymes
* Pain control with IV morphine, OOB, and PT
* Continuing aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor, and Metoprolol
* Holding on ACE due to hypotension, will restart once CP controlled and no SBPs > 110 systolic
* Continuing Ranitidine
* Starting ACE-I as soon as BPs tolerate
* Considering sinemet for Parkinson's disease
* Holding MTX short-term, but will need to be restarted long-term

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest
* Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia and respiratory failure
* Renal complications, such as acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease
* Neurological complications, such as stroke and seizures
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding and obstruction
* Hematological complications, such as anemia and bleeding disorders
* Infectious complications, such as sepsis and septic shock

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan as needed to prevent and manage these potential complications."
