You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male admitted to the ICU with septic shock, hypoxia, and pleural effusions. He has a history of recent admission for painless jaundice, sphincterotomy, and biliary stent placement. The patient is febrile, tachycardic, and has an increased respiratory rate. His white blood cell count is elevated, and he has bandemia. The source of the sepsis is unclear, but it may be related to a pulmonary or gastrointestinal source, given his recent diarrhea.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, and his blood cultures are pending. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and is receiving vasopressor support. His pleural effusions are being treated with diuretics, and he is being monitored for signs of worsening respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient is at risk of developing further complications related to septic shock, including organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely related to his pleural effusions, and he is at risk of developing further respiratory failure if his effusions are not adequately treated.
3. ARF: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury, which may be related to his septic shock or other underlying conditions.
4. Biliary complications: The patient's recent admission for painless jaundice and sphincterotomy suggest that he may be at risk of developing biliary complications, such as cholangitis or biliary stricture.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of MI and known AFib put him at risk of developing further cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
6. GI complications: The patient's recent diarrhea and potential GI source of sepsis put him at risk of developing further GI complications, such as colitis or perforation.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's septic shock and hypoxia put him at risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male admitted to the ICU with septic shock, hypoxia, and pleural effusions. He has a history of recent admission for painless jaundice, sphincterotomy, and biliary stent placement. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°F, heart rate of 115 bpm, and blood pressure of 119/50 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100% on an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is taking warfarin. He has a cardiac history of MI in 2016 and is being treated with high-dose aspirin and cycling enzymes. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, bandemia, and increased lactate levels, indicating sepsis. His liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels.

Plan:

1. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole.
2. Titrate central venous pressure (CVP) to 8-12 mmHg and bolus as needed.
3. Switch to phenylephrine to avoid beta-adrenergic effects of levophed.
4. Transfuse as needed for hematocrit (Hct) > 30% if mixed venous oxygen (MvO2) is < 70%.
5. Basal cortisol level.
6. Re-site line due to malpositioning.
7. Continue nasal cannula oxygen therapy.
8. Daily chest X-ray.
9. Add nebulizer therapy as needed.
10. Consider thoracentesis for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
11. Empirically treat for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.
12. NPO for now.
13. Trend liver function tests.
14. Empirically treat with piperacillin-tazobactam and metronidazole for biliary bugs.
15. Hold antihypertensives and pressors as needed.
16. Repeat echocardiogram.
17. Consider aggressive diuresis once off pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and liver failure.
2. Pulmonary embolism due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pleural effusions.
3. Cardiac complications, including atrial fibrillation, cardiac tamponade, or myocardial infarction.
4. Biliary complications, including cholangitis, biliary sepsis, or biliary obstruction.
5. Renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or pre-renal azotemia.
6. Hypotension and shock due to sepsis, cardiac failure, or vasopressor withdrawal.
7. Respiratory failure due to pneumonia, pleural effusions, or lung injury.
8. Gastrointestinal complications, including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
9. Hemorrhagic complications, including bleeding from the biliary tract or gastrointestinal tract.
10. Infection-related complications, including sepsis, bacteremia, or meningitis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a septic shock patient admitted to the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 115 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 119/50 mmHg. The patient is receiving vasopressor support with phenylephrine. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 100% and an ABG showing a pH of 7.36, partial pressure of oxygen of 184 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 46 mmHg. The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a normal sinus rhythm and no acute changes on physical examination.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, neutrophilia, and lactate levels, consistent with sepsis. The patient's liver enzymes are mildly elevated, and the patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated lactate levels and neutrophilia suggest ongoing sepsis, which may lead to organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, or renal failure.
2. Antibiotic resistance: The patient's septic shock may be resistant to antibiotics, which may lead to treatment failure and worsening of the patient's condition.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and irregular rhythm may indicate cardiovascular instability, which may lead to arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or cardiogenic shock.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the patient may still be at risk for respiratory failure, particularly if the patient's underlying lung disease is not well-controlled.
5. Renal failure: The patient's elevated lactate levels and neutrophilia suggest ongoing sepsis, which may lead to renal failure, particularly if the patient is not adequately hydrated.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's septic shock may lead to neurological complications, including altered mental status, seizures, or stroke.
7. DVT and PE: The patient's immobilization and underlying medical conditions may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
8. Stress ulcer and GI bleeding: The patient's septic shock may lead to stress ulceration and gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly if the patient's blood pressure is not adequately controlled.
9. VAP: The patient's septic shock may increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, particularly if the patient's respiratory status is not well-controlled.

Given the patient's septic shock and underlying medical conditions, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease who was recently admitted to the ICU due to shock, respiratory distress, and sepsis. He had undergone ERCP with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement for a high-grade stricture of the common bile duct, and had developed atypical brushings and elevated CA-9, suspicious for pancreatic cancer. He was transferred from the operating room with shock, leukocytosis, and elevated BNP, likely due to septic shock with a possible cardiogenic component.

Medical Complications:

1. Shock: The patient is in septic shock, with a possible cardiogenic component. He has positive blood cultures from the operating room and is at risk for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection given his recent diarrhea and antibiotic use.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient has hypoxemia likely due to volume overload and effusions. There is a possibility of underlying pneumonia (PNA).
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is not well-controlled, and he is at risk for stroke and systemic embolism.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has pre-renal ARF and may have an ATN component. He will require volume resuscitation and careful monitoring of his creatinine and urine output.
5. Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer and will require wound care consult.
6. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is at risk for cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction.
7. Fluid Overload: The patient has fluid overload, which may be contributing to his hypoxemia and respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further sepsis and septic shock.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a possibility of underlying pneumonia, which could worsen his respiratory status.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease put him at risk for cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction and stroke.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's pre-renal ARF could progress to ATN, leading to chronic kidney disease.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infection, including C. diff and pneumonia.

ICU Care Plan:

1. Fluid Management: The patient will require careful fluid management to prevent further fluid overload and hypoxemia.
2. Antibiotic Therapy: The patient will receive broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential infections, including C. diff and pneumonia.
3. Cardiovascular Support: The patient will require cardiovascular support, including pressors and intubation, to manage his shock and hypoxemia.
4. Renal Support: The patient will require renal support, including volume resuscitation and careful monitoring of his creatinine and urine output.
5. Wound Care: The patient will require wound care consult for his sacral decubitus ulcer.
6. Cardiovascular Medications: The patient's cardiovascular medications, including aspirin and ACE inhibitor, will be held while he is on pressors.
7. Nutritional Support: The patient will require nutritional support, including total parenteral nutrition (TPN), due to his hypoxemia and need for significant supplemental oxygen."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: shock, respiratory distress
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the

   above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   82 yo M w/afib on coumadin, hypothyroidism, and CAD s/p MI s/p recent
   ERCP w/sphincterotomy and biliary stent for high grade stricture of CBD
   c/b shock, req pressors and intubation x48hrs peri-procedure (brushings
   were ""atypical"" and CA [**65**]-9 very elevated, suspcious for pancreatic ca)
   transferred from OSH w/shock, leukocytosis (WBC 30K w/40% bands), and
   BNP 10K.  Likely septic shock, though may be cardiogenic component
   w/BNP 10K- checking CvO2.  Potential souces of infection= c diff given
   sig diarrhea and recent abx (most likely) vs. pna vs. biliary source
   (but LFTs better and no RUQ TTP); pan cx'd.  Bolus for CVP goal ~10,
   MAP >65 w/levophed.  On 6L suppl O2- hypoxemia likely [**2-1**] pleural
   effusions + mild pulm edema; monitor O2 sats closely w/IVF
   resuscitation.  Afib currently not rate controlled- but in shock and on
   levophed, rx'ing underlyzing causes.  ARF- pre-renal +/- ATN, following

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a complex medical history, including atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease. He has been experiencing shock, respiratory distress, and has been intubated for 48 hours.

The patient's condition is likely septic shock, with a possible cardiogenic component, given his elevated BNP levels. The potential sources of infection are C. diff, PNA, or biliary source. He has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, metronidazole, and piperacillin.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with hypoxemia and mild pulmonary edema. He is on 6 liters of supplemental oxygen and has a SpO2 of 99%. His heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation, which is not rate-controlled, but he is receiving levophed to maintain a MAP of 65.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 26 mg/dL. His liver function tests (LFTs) are mildly elevated, but his bilirubin level is normal.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Volume resuscitation to maintain a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10.
2. Maintenance of a MAP of 60 with levophed.
3. Diarrhea management, including checking for C. diff.
4. Cough management, including checking for PNA.
5. Biliary sepsis management, including checking blood and urine cultures.
6. Cardiogenic component management, including checking Scvo2.
7. Restarting heparin when no imminent procedures are planned.
8. Restarting b-blocker when stable.
9. Renal dose adjustment of medications.
10. Monitoring of electrolytes, including potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver failure, and respiratory failure.
2. Cardiogenic shock, given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and elevated BNP levels.
3. Pneumonia, given the patient's cough and pleural effusions.
4. C. diff colitis, given the patient's diarrhea and recent antibiotic use.
5. Biliary sepsis, given the patient's recent ERCP and sphincterotomy.
6. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN), given the patient's kidney injury and potential for volume overload.
7. Pulmonary edema, given the patient's hypoxemia and mild pulmonary edema.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease who presented to the ICU with shock, respiratory distress, and leukocytosis. He had recently undergone ERCP with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement for a high-grade stricture of the common bile duct. The patient required pressors and intubation for 48 hours post-procedure. He was transferred from the operating room with shock, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis.

The patient's current condition includes:

* Shock: Presumed sepsis with leukocytosis and bandemia
* Hypoxemia: Likely due to bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema
* Afib: Rate controlled with neo, but underlying issues need to be addressed
* ARF: FENa 0.2 suggests pre-renal etiology, but may be an ATN component
* Sacral and bilateral heel decubitus: Wound care consult needed
* CAD: Continued ASA, holding BB and ACEI while requiring pressors
* FEN: NPO for now due to hypoxemia requiring significant supplemental oxygen

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, bandemia, and positive blood cultures suggest sepsis. The patient's condition requires broad-spectrum antibiotics and close monitoring for signs of septic shock.
2. C. difficile: The patient's recent antibiotic use and diarrhea symptoms increase the risk of C. difficile infection. The patient's treatment plan includes changing IV Flagyl to PO vancomycin to reduce the risk of C. difficile.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated CA 65-9 levels suggest pancreatic cancer, which may be contributing to his symptoms. The patient's treatment plan includes close monitoring for signs of pancreatitis.
4. Biliary source of infection: The patient's recent ERCP procedure and elevated liver function tests suggest a biliary source of infection. The patient's treatment plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotics and close monitoring for signs of biliary sepsis.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's hypoxemia and bilateral pleural effusions increase his risk of respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
7. Renal complications: The patient's acute kidney injury and elevated creatinine levels increase his risk of renal complications, such as chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
8. Adrenal dysfunction: The patient's high-dose steroids and recent stress may increase his risk of adrenal dysfunction. The patient's treatment plan includes close monitoring for signs of adrenal insufficiency."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease who was admitted to the ICU due to shock, respiratory distress, and suspected septic shock. He had recently undergone an ERCP procedure for a high-grade stricture of the common bile duct and had developed diarrhea, cough, and worsening lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, band count, and lactate dehydrogenase, suggesting sepsis. He is currently receiving pressors and intubation and has been transferred from the operating room with shock, leukocytosis, and a BNP of 10,000.

Potential medical complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results suggest septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and management.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is likely due to pleural effusions and mild pulmonary edema, which needs to be closely monitored and managed.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently not rate-controlled, which may contribute to his hypotension. Underlying causes of atrial fibrillation need to be addressed.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely pre-renal and may be exacerbated by hypovolemia and ATN. Close monitoring of creatinine and urine output is necessary.
5. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, which needs to be managed with wound care consult.
6. Cardiovascular disease: The patient's CAD may be contributing to his hypotension, and cardiac enzymes are negative.
7. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated CA 65-9 suggests the possibility of pancreatic cancer, which needs to be investigated further.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to manage septic shock with broad-spectrum antibiotics and vasopressors.
2. Monitor the patient's hypoxemia closely and adjust oxygen therapy as needed.
3. Address underlying causes of atrial fibrillation, including rate control and underlying cardiac conditions.
4. Manage acute renal failure with volume resuscitation and close monitoring of creatinine and urine output.
5. Manage the sacral decubitus ulcer with wound care consult.
6. Investigate the possibility of pancreatic cancer with further imaging and laboratory tests.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust therapy as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease (CAD) who was recently admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory distress, and leukocytosis. He underwent an ERCP procedure with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement for a high-grade stricture of the common bile duct. The patient required pressors and intubation for 48 hours post-procedure and was transferred from the operating room to the ICU with ongoing shock, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis. Laboratory results show elevated CA 65-9 levels, suspicious for pancreatic cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock, leukocytosis, and bandemia suggest a possible septic source, which could be from the ERCP procedure, the pancreas, or the biliary tract. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and further cultures are pending.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemia and pleural effusions may be related to the ERCP procedure or underlying pulmonary disease. Diuresis is not currently possible due to the patient's need for pressors, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation is well-controlled on neo, but underlying issues need to be addressed. Restarting heparin when no imminent procedures are planned is also necessary.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's FENa is 0.2, suggesting a pre-renal etiology, although an ATN component cannot be ruled out. Renal dose medications and close monitoring of urine output and creatinine levels are necessary.
5. Wound Complications: The patient has sacral and bilateral heel decubitus ulcers, which require wound care consultation and close monitoring.
6. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's history of CAD and recent MI increase his risk of cardiac arrest. Close monitoring of cardiac enzymes and EKG changes is necessary.
7. Infection: The patient's diarrhea and recent antibiotic use make him at high risk for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. Further cultures and stool tests are pending.
8. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated CA 65-9 levels suggest a possible pancreatic source of infection, which needs to be further evaluated.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitor for signs of sepsis.
2. Diuresis should be attempted when the patient's condition allows.
3. Restart heparin when no imminent procedures are planned.
4. Monitor for signs of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
5. Close monitoring of renal function and urine output is necessary.
6. Wound care consultation and close monitoring of wound healing are necessary.
7. Monitor for signs of C. diff infection and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.
8. Further evaluation of the patient's pancreas and biliary tract is necessary to determine the underlying cause of his symptoms."

   Imaging: CXR:
   Tip of the new right IJ line ends in the lower SVC, right subclavian
   line tip
   projects over the superior cavoatrial junction as before, large right
   pleural
   effusion is stable, and small left pleural effusion unchanged. Heart
   size top
   normal, partially obscured by large right pleural effusion. Mediastinal
   vascular engorgement improved slightly. No pneumothorax. Gaseous
   distention of the stomach has improved.
   Microbiology: Blood Cultures: GPC in [**2-1**] cultures.
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 82 M w/ recent admission for painless jaundice s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy and biliary stent c/b hypoxia requiring intubation,
   admitted with septic shock
   .
   Septic Shock: On admission was febrile, WBC > 30 with bandemia,
   tachycardic, increased RR.  Now with GPC in blood.  Unclear source, but
   must consider endocarditis, pulmonary, decubiti or GI source given
   recent diarrhea.  Patient without abdominal pain or jaundice to suggest
   acute cholangitis.
   f/u Sputum, Blood, Urine Cx, Cdiff x 3
   1.        Will treat broadly with Vanc/Zosyn/PO Vanco for C. Diff
   2.        Titrate CVP to 10, bolus as needed
   3.        Switched to phenylephrine to avoid beta adrtenergic effect of
   levophed and resulting tachycardia.  Added vasopressin this AM.  Check
   Mixed Venous O2 sat.  Adjust PRN.  Might need dobutamine for inotrpoic
   support.
   4.        Transfuse as needed for Hct>30 if MvO2 is < 70%
   5.        Basal cortisol level wnl, no [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   6.        Line re-positioned, f/u culture of tip although unlikely
   source as placed less than 36 hours ago at OSH.
   7.        TTE for endocarditis.  If negative would get CT Scan
   chest/abdomen looking for abdomen.  ?osteo underlying wounds.
   8.        Wound care consult.
   9.        CT Chest today for ? effusion/pneumonia.
   .
   Hypoxia: Patient comfortable on 6L.  He is willing to be intubated.
   Hypoxia likely a result of pleural effusions, sepsis, volume
   recuscitation.
   1.        ABG this AM 7.35/45/132
   2.        Continue nasal cannula at this point.
   3.        Daily CXR
   4.        Add nebulizer prn
   .
   Pleural effusions: may be malignant pleural effusions vs. chf vs. pna
   1.        ECHO, cycle enzymes, daily EKG
   2.        Empirically treat for HAP with Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: likely pre-renal from sepsis/hypotension.  UOP has
   dropped off this morning, and now with rising Cr/lactate.  Added
   vasopressin for second pressor and goal of improved renal perfusion.
   Goal MAP of 70 for today.
   1.        Follow Cr.
   .
   Biliary stricture: Patient with recent admission for painless jaudince
   requiring biliary stent and sphincterotomy.  Patient due to stent
   change in [**2155-6-1**].  Patient does not appear to have clinical signs of
   cholangitis at this point.
   1.        NPO for now
   2.        Trend LFTs
   3.        empirically treat with Zosyn for biliary organisms
   .
   CAD: MI in [**2106**]'s.  Give high dose ASA.  Enzymes negative x1 - and with
   negative set at OSH more than 12 hours apart.  No need to cycle
   further.
   .
   PUMP: Hold antihypertensives, pressors as needed.  Will repeat ECHO.
   Patient grossly volume overloaded, and may require aggressive diuresis
   once he's off pressors.
   .
   RHYTHM: known afib on coumadin.  Hold coumadin. Rate much improved
   after switch to neosynephrine.
   .
   ARF: Cr up to 1.9 from basline.
   1.        urine lytes show FENA 0.2%, pre-renal vs ATN in setting
   hypotension
   .
   Nutrition: Consult this AM for low albumin.
   1.        Would restart regular diet if possible although with
   respiratory status.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 82-year-old male admitted with septic shock, hypoxia, and acute renal failure. He has a history of recent admission for painless jaundice and sphincterotomy with biliary stent placement.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.5°C (97.7°F)
* Heart rate: 110 bpm (normal range: 100-121 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 93/62 mmHg (normal range: 75-120/81 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 24 inspirations per minute (normal range: 11-30 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 91% (normal range: 95-100%)
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 34.8 x 10^9/L (normal range: 4-11 x 10^9/L)
* Hemoglobin: 12.9 g/dL (normal range: 13.5-17.5 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 295 x 10^9/L (normal range: 150-450 x 10^9/L)
* Creatinine: 1.9 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Blood urea nitrogen: 22 mmol/L (normal range: 3.4-8.2 mmol/L)
* Lactic acid: 2.7 mmol/L (normal range: 0.5-2.0 mmol/L)
* Albumin: 1.9 g/dL (normal range: 3.5-5.5 g/dL)

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: large right pleural effusion, small left pleural effusion, and mediastinal vascular engorgement

The patient's microbiology results show:

* Blood cultures: GPC (Gram-positive cocci) in two cultures

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Septic shock: broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment with vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole
* Hypoxia: continue nasal cannula oxygen therapy and monitor oxygen saturation
* Pleural effusions: consider echocardiogram, cycle enzymes, and daily electrocardiogram
* Acute renal failure: add vasopressin for second pressor and goal of improved renal perfusion
* Biliary stricture: empirically treat with piperacillin-tazobactam for biliary organisms
* CAD: give high-dose aspirin and monitor for signs of cardiac ischemia

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction (e.g., acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome)
* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections
* Cardiac complications (e.g., arrhythmias, heart failure)
* Gastrointestinal complications (e.g., diarrhea, gastrointestinal bleeding)
* Neurological complications (e.g., encephalopathy, seizures)
* Hematological complications (e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombocytopenia)

The patient's treatment plan should focus on addressing these potential complications and optimizing his respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal function."

   projects over the superior cavoatrial junction as before, large right
   pleural
   effusion is stable, and small left pleural effusion unchanged. Heart
   size top
   normal, partially obscured by large right pleural effusion. Mediastinal
   vascular engorgement improved slightly. No pneumothorax. Gaseous
   distention of the stomach has improved.
   Microbiology: Blood Cultures: GPC in [**2-1**] cultures.
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 82 M w/ recent admission for painless jaundice s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy and biliary stent c/b hypoxia requiring intubation,
   admitted with septic shock
   .
   Septic Shock: On admission was febrile, WBC > 30 with bandemia,
   tachycardic, increased RR.  Now with GPC in blood.  Unclear source, but
   must consider endocarditis, pulmonary, decubiti or GI source given
   recent diarrhea.  Patient without abdominal pain or jaundice to suggest
   acute cholangitis.
   f/u Sputum, Blood, Urine Cx, Cdiff x 3
   1.        Will treat broadly with Vanc/Zosyn/PO Vanco for C. Diff
   2.        Titrate CVP to 10, bolus as needed
   3.        Switched to phenylephrine to avoid beta adrtenergic effect of
   levophed and resulting tachycardia.  Will add vasopressin this AM.
   4.        Transfuse as needed for Hct>30 if MvO2 is < 70%
   5.        Basal cortisol level wnl, no [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   6.        Line re-positioned, f/u culture of tip although unlikely
   source as placed less than 36 hours ago at OSH.
   7.        TTE for endocarditis.  If negative would get CT Scan
   chest/abdomen looking for abdomen.  ?osteo underlying wounds.
   8.        Wound care consult.
   .
   Hypoxia: Patient comfortable on 6L.  He is willing to be intubated.
   Hypoxia likely a result of pleural effusions, sepsis, volume
   recuscitation.
   1.        ABG this AM 7.35/45/132
   2.        Continue nasal cannula at this point.
   3.        Daily CXR
   4.        Add nebulizer prn
   .
   Pleural effusions: may be malignant pleural effusions vs. chf vs. pna
   1.        ECHO, cycle enzymes, daily EKG
   2.        Empirically treat for HAP with Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: likely pre-renal from sepsis/hypotension.  UOP has
   dropped off this morning, and now with rising Cr/lactate.  Added
   vasopressin for second pressor and goal of improved renal perfusion.
   Goal MAP of 70 for today.
   1.        Follow Cr.
   .
   Biliary stricture: Patient with recent admission for painless jaudince
   requiring biliary stent and sphincterotomy.  Patient due to stent
   change in [**2155-6-1**].  Patient does not appear to have clinical signs of
   cholangitis at this point.
   1.        NPO for now
   2.        Trend LFTs
   3.        empirically treat with Zosyn/Flagyl for biliary organisms
   .
   CAD: MI in [**2106**]'s.  Give high dose ASA.  Enzymes negative x1 - and with
   negative set at OSH more than 12 hours apart.  No need to cycle
   further.
   .
   PUMP: Hold antihypertensives, pressors as needed.  Will repeat ECHO.
   Patient grossly volume overloaded, and may require aggressive diuresis
   once he's off pressors.
   .
   RHYTHM: known afib on coumadin.  Hold coumadin. Rate much improved
   after switch to neosynephrine.
   .
   ARF: Cr up to 1.9 from basline.
   1.        urine lytes show FENA 0.2%, pre-renal vs ATN in setting
   hypotension
   .
   Nutrition: Consult this AM for low albumin.
   1.        Would restart regular diet if possible although with
   respiratory status.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Imaging: CXR:
   Tip of the new right IJ line ends in the lower SVC, right subclavian
   line tip
   projects over the superior cavoatrial junction as before, large right
   pleural
   effusion is stable, and small left pleural effusion unchanged. Heart
   size top
   normal, partially obscured by large right pleural effusion. Mediastinal
   vascular engorgement improved slightly. No pneumothorax. Gaseous
   distention of the stomach has improved.
   Microbiology: Blood Cultures: GPC in [**2-1**] cultures.
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 82 M w/ recent admission for painless jaundice s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy and biliary stent c/b hypoxia requiring intubation,
   admitted with septic shock
   .
   Septic Shock: On admission was febrile, WBC > 30 with bandemia,
   tachycardic, increased RR.  Now with GPC in blood.  Unclear source, but
   must consider endocarditis, pulmonary, decubiti or GI source given
   recent diarrhea.  Patient without abdominal pain or jaundice to suggest
   acute cholangitis.
   f/u Sputum, Blood, Urine Cx, Cdiff x 3
   1.        Will treat broadly with Vanc/Zosyn/PO Vanco for C. Diff
   2.        Titrate CVP to 10, bolus as needed
   3.        Switched to phenylephrine to avoid beta adrtenergic effect of
   levophed and resulting tachycardia.  Will add vasopressin this AM.
   4.        Transfuse as needed for Hct>30 if MvO2 is < 70%
   5.        Basal cortisol level wnl, no [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   6.        Line re-positioned, f/u culture of tip although unlikely
   source as placed less than 36 hours ago at OSH.
   7.        TTE for endocarditis.  If negative would get CT Scan
   chest/abdomen looking for abdomen.  ?osteo underlying wounds.
   8.        Wound care consult.
   .
   Hypoxia: Patient comfortable on 6L.  He is willing to be intubated.
   Hypoxia likely a result of pleural effusions, sepsis, volume
   recuscitation.
   1.        ABG this AM 7.35/45/132
   2.        Continue nasal cannula at this point.
   3.        Daily CXR
   4.        Add nebulizer prn
   .
   Pleural effusions: may be malignant pleural effusions vs. chf vs. pna
   1.        ECHO, cycle enzymes, daily EKG
   2.        Empirically treat for HAP with Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: likely pre-renal from sepsis/hypotension.  UOP has
   dropped off this morning, and now with rising Cr/lactate.  Added
   vasopressin for second pressor and goal of improved renal perfusion.
   Goal MAP of 70 for today.
   1.        Follow Cr.
   .
   Biliary stricture: Patient with recent admission for painless jaudince
   requiring biliary stent and sphincterotomy.  Patient due to stent
   change in [**2155-6-1**].  Patient does not appear to have clinical signs of
   cholangitis at this point.
   1.        NPO for now
   2.        Trend LFTs
   3.        empirically treat with Zosyn/Flagyl for biliary organisms
   .
   CAD: MI in [**2106**]'s.  Give high dose ASA.  Enzymes negative x1 - and with
   negative set at OSH more than 12 hours apart.  No need to cycle
   further.
   .
   PUMP: Hold antihypertensives, pressors as needed.  Will repeat ECHO.
   Patient grossly volume overloaded, and may require aggressive diuresis
   once he's off pressors.
   .
   RHYTHM: known afib on coumadin.  Hold coumadin. Rate much improved
   after switch to neosynephrine.
   .
   ARF: Cr up to 1.9 from basline.
   1.        urine lytes show FENA 0.2%, pre-renal vs ATN in setting
   hypotension
   .
   Nutrition: Consult this AM for low albumin.
   1.        Would restart regular diet if possible although with
   respiratory status.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 82-year-old male admitted to the ICU with septic shock, hypoxia, and acute renal failure. The patient has a history of recent admission for painless jaundice, sphincterotomy, and biliary stent placement.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.5°C, Heart rate 110 bpm, Blood pressure 93/62 mmHg, Respiratory rate 24 breaths/min, SpO2 91%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) 1 mmHg, Mean arterial pressure (MAP) not specified.
* Fluid balance: Total input 4,185 mL, Total output 825 mL, Fluid balance 3,360 mL.
* Respiratory support: Oxygen delivery device Aerosol-cool, SpO2 91%.
* Laboratory results:
	+ White blood cell count (WBC) 34.8 K/uL
	+ Hematocrit (Hct) 40.9%
	+ Platelet count (Plt) 295 K/uL
	+ Creatinine (Cr) 1.9 mg/dL
	+ Troponin-T 0.01 ng/mL
	+ Lactic acid 2.7 mmol/L
	+ Albumin 1.9 g/dL
	+ LDH 219 IU/L
	+ Calcium 7.0 mg/dL
	+ Magnesium 2.0 mg/dL
	+ Phosphorus 4.5 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Endocarditis: Given the patient's history of recent sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement, endocarditis is a possible source of the septicemia.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient's hypoxia and respiratory failure may be exacerbated by a pulmonary embolism.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's rising creatinine levels and low urine output suggest acute kidney injury, which may be pre-renal or post-renal in origin.
* Biliary stricture: The patient's recent admission for painless jaundice and sphincterotomy may be related to a biliary stricture, which could lead to cholangitis or pancreatitis.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's history of MI and known atrial fibrillation (AF) may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn/PO Vanco) for suspected C. Diff infection
* Titration of CVP to 10 mmHg and bolus as needed
* Switch to phenylephrine to avoid beta-adrenergic effect of levophed
* Transfusion as needed for Hct > 30% if MvO2 < 70%
* Basal cortisol level wnl, no [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
* Line re-positioned, f/u culture of tip although unlikely source as placed less than 36 hours ago at OSH
* TTE for endocarditis. If negative, get CT Scan chest/abdomen looking for abdomen.?osteo underlying wounds.
* Wound care consult.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* ABG this AM 7.35/45/132
* Continue nasal cannula at this point
* Daily CXR
* Add nebulizer prn
* ECHO, cycle enzymes, daily EKG
* Empirically treat for HAP with Vanc/Zosyn
* Follow Cr.
* NPO for now
* Trend LFTs
* Empirically treat with Zosyn/Flagyl for biliary organisms
* Hold antihypertensives, pressors as needed. Will repeat ECHO.
* Patient grossly volume overloaded, and may require aggressive diuresis once he's off pressors.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is unclear at this time."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male admitted to the ICU with septic shock, respiratory distress, and multiorgan failure. The patient has a complex medical history, including atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and a recent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Shock: Presumed sepsis with leukocytosis and bandemia, with possible sources being the bowel, skin, or pancreas.
2. Hypoxemia: Likely due to pleural effusions and pulmonary edema, with a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 10,000 at the outside hospital.
3. Atrial fibrillation: Rate better controlled with neosinatriptan, but the patient is not yet stable enough to add a beta blocker.
4. Oliguric acute renal failure (ARF): Suspected to be developing acute tubular necrosis (ATN), with rising creatinine and lactate levels.
5. Respiratory distress: Requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
6. Cardiac issues: Coronary artery disease with a recent myocardial infarction, and holding beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) while requiring pressors.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), and hepatic dysfunction.
2. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, and cardiogenic shock.
3. Renal complications, such as ATN, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
4. Respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory failure.
5. Wound complications, such as infection, dehiscence, and poor wound healing.
6. Neurological complications, such as sepsis-related encephalopathy, cerebral edema, and seizures.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Zosyn, vancomycin, and piperacillin-tazobactam.
2. Vasopressors, including phenylephrine and vasopressin, to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of at least 65 mmHg.
3. Mechanical ventilation to support respiratory function.
4. Cardiovascular support, including beta blockers and ACEIs, when stable.
5. Renal support, including diuretics and hemodialysis, as needed.
6. Wound care and debridement, as necessary.
7. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and imaging studies to guide treatment and adjust the plan as needed.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and multiorgan dysfunction, it is essential to closely monitor his condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent complications and improve his chances of recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and recent ERCP with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement. He was transferred to the ICU from the operating room with septic shock, respiratory distress, and leukocytosis. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with worsening respiratory failure, oliguric acute kidney injury, and increasing lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is likely due to a presumed bacterial infection, possibly originating from the bowel, skin, or pancreatic cancer. The patient's high-risk status for Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection is a concern.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's oliguric AKI is a concern, and the possibility of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is suspected. Close monitoring of urine output, electrolytes, and creatinine levels is necessary.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemia is likely due to pleural effusions and pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory support is necessary.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation is a concern, and the possibility of cardiac tamponade needs to be considered given the effusion and malignancy.
5. Adrenal Dysfunction: The patient's increasing pressor requirements may indicate adrenal dysfunction, which needs to be considered and managed.
6. Pancreatic Cancer: The patient's elevated CA-9 levels and atypical brushings during ERCP suggest a possible pancreatic cancer diagnosis, which needs to be further evaluated.
7. Wound Complications: The patient's sacral and bilateral heel decubitus ulcers require wound care consultation and close monitoring for signs of infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and adjust as necessary based on cultures and sensitivities.
2. Monitor the patient's CVP goal and adjust pressors accordingly.
3. Recheck urine output, electrolytes, and creatinine levels regularly to monitor AKI.
4. Continue respiratory support and consider intubation if necessary.
5. Consider steroids empirically if increasing pressor requirements.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and consider adding a beta blocker when stable.
7. Continue wound care consultation and close monitoring for signs of infection.
8. Consider a chest CT to evaluate the patient's respiratory status and potential underlying pneumonia.
9. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust therapy as necessary to maintain tight glycemic control."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and recent ERCP with sphincterotomy and biliary stent for a high-grade stricture of the common bile duct. He was transferred to the ICU from the emergency room with shock, leukocytosis, and hypoxemia. The patient has a presumed septic shock with leukocytosis/bandemia and a low central venous oxygen saturation (CvO2) of 75%. He has a positive blood culture from the outside hospital and is suspected to have Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) given the presence of diarrhea and recent antibiotic use. The patient is also at risk of adrenal dysfunction and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Zosyn and vancomycin.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's presumed septic shock with leukocytosis/bandemia and low CvO2 of 75% puts him at risk for further organ dysfunction and failure.
2. C. diff colitis: The patient's diarrhea and recent antibiotic use make him susceptible to C. diff infection, which can lead to severe colitis and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated CA-9 levels and ""atypical"" brushings from the ERCP procedure make pancreatitis a possible diagnosis, which can lead to severe abdominal pain, organ dysfunction, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Biliary source of sepsis: The patient's recent ERCP procedure and biliary stent placement make a biliary source of sepsis a possibility, which can lead to further organ dysfunction and failure.
5. Adrenal dysfunction: The patient's suspected C. diff infection and recent antibiotic use put him at risk for adrenal dysfunction, which can lead to life-threatening complications if not recognized and treated promptly.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and need for pressors make respiratory failure a potential complication, particularly if not treated promptly with mechanical ventilation and other supportive measures.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease make cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction, a possibility, particularly if not treated promptly with anticoagulation and other supportive measures.
8. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) and need for pressors make renal failure a potential complication, particularly if not treated promptly with dialysis and other supportive measures.
9. Wound complications: The patient's sacral and bilateral heel decubitus ulcers make wound complications, such as infection and necrosis, a possibility, particularly if not treated promptly with wound care and other supportive measures."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male admitted to the ICU with septic shock, respiratory distress, and atrial fibrillation. He has a history of CAD, recent ERCP, and high-grade stricture of the CBD. He was transferred from the operating room with shock, leukocytosis, and hypoxemia. The patient's condition has deteriorated over the past 24 hours, with decreased urine output, rising creatinine, and increasing lactate levels. He is currently receiving vasopressors and has been intubated.

Medical Complications:

1. Shock: The patient's septic shock is likely due to a presumed sepsis with leukocytosis and bandemia. Possible sources of infection include the bowel, skin (decubitus ulcers), and possible pancreatic cancer.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is likely due to pleural effusions and pulmonary edema. He has a high BNP level, which may be related to his atrial fibrillation and cardiac condition.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled with neosinopril, but his underlying conditions need to be addressed. He is holding coumadin due to supratherapeutic INR.
4. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: The patient's oliguric ARF is suspected to be developing into acute tubular necrosis. His urine output needs to be closely monitored, and his creatinine levels need to be trended.
5. Sacral and bilateral heel decubitus ulcers: The patient requires wound care consult and regular turning to prevent further pressure damage.
6. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's CAD is being managed with ASA and holding beta blockers and ACE inhibitors while requiring pressors.
7. Feeding: The patient is NPO due to hypoxemia and requires significant supplemental oxygen.
8. Access: The patient has multiple lines, including a central venous line, arterial line, and Foley catheter.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is a significant risk factor for developing further complications, including organ failure and death.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemia and pleural effusions increase his risk of developing respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's atrial fibrillation and cardiac condition increase his risk of cardiac arrest.
4. Acute Tubular Necrosis: The patient's oliguric ARF is at risk of progressing to acute tubular necrosis, which can lead to chronic kidney disease and death.
5. Wound Infections: The patient's sacral and bilateral heel decubitus ulcers are at risk of developing wound infections, which can lead to sepsis and death."

   Imaging: CT Chest
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No evidence of pneumonia. Large right pleural effusion causing
   complete
   collapse of the right lung, which was previously partially aerated.
   Component
   of mucus plugging may be superimposed and continued radiographic
   follow-up
   needed. Moderate left pleural effusion causing complete atelectasis of
   the
   basilar left lower lobe segments. Right chest wall edema.
   2. Atherosclerotic calcifications within the aorta and coronary
   circulation.
   3. Interval increase in intra-abdominal ascites, with resolution of
   previously identified intrahepatic biliary dilatation and stable
   appearance to
   simple and hyperdense renal lesions better described on previously
   performed
   dedicated CT abdomen. Pancreatic ductal dilatation persists.
   Microbiology: VRE Swab: Positive
   Blood: MRSA [**4-4**] from [**2155-5-9**]
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 82 M w/ recent admission for painless jaundice s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy and biliary stent c/b hypoxia requiring intubation,
   admitted with septic shock
   .
   Septic Shock: On admission was febrile, WBC > 30 with bandemia,
   tachycardic, increased RR.  Now with GPC in blood.  Unclear source, but
   must consider endocarditis, pulmonary, decubiti or GI source given
   recent instrumentation.  Patient without abdominal pain or jaundice to
   suggest acute cholangitis.
   .
   Goals of Care: Will need to meet with family today to discuss goals of
   care
 currently no escalation of care.
   .
   f/u Sputum, Blood, Urine Cx, Cdiff x 3 - MRSA+ Bacteremia - unclear
   source, ? parapneumonic effusion, endocarditis, complication of biliary
   stent placement.
   1.        Will treat broadly with Vanc/Zosyn/PO Vanco for C. Diff -
   consider d/c zosyn today.
   2.        Titrate CVP to 10, bolus as needed
   3.        Switched to phenylephrine to avoid beta adrtenergic effect of
   levophed and resulting tachycardia.  Added vasopressin this AM.  Check
   Mixed Venous O2 sat.  Adjust PRN.  Might need dobutamine for inotrpoic
   support but would defer at this time.
   4.        Transfuse as needed for Hct>30 if MvO2 is < 70%.
   5.        Basal cortisol level wnl, no [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   6.        Line re-positioned, f/u culture of tip.
   7.        TTE for endocarditis.  If negative would get CT Scan
   chest/abdomen looking for abdomen.  ?osteo underlying wounds.
   8.        Wound care consult.
   9.        Consider thoracentesis of effusion
   .
   Hypoxia: Patient comfortable on 6L.  He is willing to be intubated.
   Hypoxia likely a result of pleural effusions, sepsis, volume
   recuscitation.
   1.        ABG this AM 7.35/45/132
   2.        Continue nasal cannula at this point.
   3.        Daily CXR
   4.        Add nebulizer prn
   .
   Pleural effusions: may be malignant pleural effusions vs. chf vs. pna
   1.        ECHO, cycle enzymes, daily EKG
   2.        Empirically treat for HAP with Vanc/Zosyn
 d/c zosyn once
   more stable.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: likely pre-renal from sepsis/hypotension.  UOP has
   dropped off this morning, and now with rising Cr/lactate.  Added
   vasopressin for second pressor and goal of improved renal perfusion.
   Goal MAP of 70 for today.
   1.        Follow Cr.
   .
   Biliary stricture: Patient with recent admission for painless jaudince
   requiring biliary stent and sphincterotomy.  Patient due to stent
   change in [**2155-6-1**].  Patient does not appear to have clinical signs of
   cholangitis at this point.
   1.        NPO for now
   2.        Trend LFTs
   3.        empirically treat with Zosyn for biliary organisms
   .
   CAD: MI in [**2106**]'s.  Give high dose ASA.  Enzymes negative x1 - and with
   negative set at OSH more than 12 hours apart.  No need to cycle
   further.
   .
   PUMP: Hold antihypertensives, pressors as needed.  Will repeat ECHO.
   Patient grossly volume overloaded, and may require aggressive diuresis
   once he's off pressors.
   .
   RHYTHM: known afib on coumadin.  Hold coumadin. Rate much improved
   after switch to neosynephrine.
   .
   ARF: Cr up to 1.9 from basline.
   1.        urine lytes show FENA 0.2%, pre-renal vs ATN in setting
   hypotension
   .
   Nutrition: Consult for low albumin.
   1.             Would restart regular diet if possible although with
   respiratory status.  Discuss goals of care with family.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Component
   of mucus plugging may be superimposed and continued radiographic
   follow-up
   needed. Moderate left pleural effusion causing complete atelectasis of
   the
   basilar left lower lobe segments. Right chest wall edema.
   2. Atherosclerotic calcifications within the aorta and coronary
   circulation.
   3. Interval increase in intra-abdominal ascites, with resolution of
   previously identified intrahepatic biliary dilatation and stable
   appearance to
   simple and hyperdense renal lesions better described on previously
   performed
   dedicated CT abdomen. Pancreatic ductal dilatation persists.
   Microbiology: VRE Swab: Positive
   Blood: MRSA [**4-4**] from [**2155-5-9**]
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 82 M w/ recent admission for painless jaundice s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy and biliary stent c/b hypoxia requiring intubation,
   admitted with septic shock
   .
   Septic Shock: On admission was febrile, WBC > 30 with bandemia,
   tachycardic, increased RR.  Now with GPC in blood.  Unclear source, but
   must consider endocarditis, pulmonary, decubiti or GI source given
   recent instrumentation.  Patient without abdominal pain or jaundice to
   suggest acute cholangitis.
   .
   Goals of Care: Will need to meet with family today to discuss goals of
   care
 currently no escalation of care.
   .
   f/u Sputum, Blood, Urine Cx, Cdiff x 3 - MRSA+ Bacteremia - unclear
   source, ? parapneumonic effusion, endocarditis, complication of biliary
   stent placement.
   1.        Will treat broadly with Vanc/Zosyn/PO Vanco for C. Diff -
   consider d/c zosyn today.
   2.        Titrate CVP to 10, bolus as needed
   3.        Switched to phenylephrine to avoid beta adrtenergic effect of
   levophed and resulting tachycardia.  Added vasopressin this AM.  Check
   Mixed Venous O2 sat.  Adjust PRN.  Might need dobutamine for inotrpoic
   support but would defer at this time.
   4.        Transfuse as needed for Hct>30 if MvO2 is < 70%.
   5.        Basal cortisol level wnl, no [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   6.        Line re-positioned, f/u culture of tip.
   7.        TTE for endocarditis.  If negative would get CT Scan
   chest/abdomen looking for abdomen.  ?osteo underlying wounds.
   8.        Wound care consult.
   9.        Consider thoracentesis of effusion
   .
   Hypoxia: Patient comfortable on 6L.  He is willing to be intubated.
   Hypoxia likely a result of pleural effusions, sepsis, volume
   recuscitation.
   1.        ABG this AM 7.35/45/132
   2.        Continue nasal cannula at this point.
   3.        Daily CXR
   4.        Add nebulizer prn
   .
   Pleural effusions: may be malignant pleural effusions vs. chf vs. pna
   1.        ECHO, cycle enzymes, daily EKG
   2.        Empirically treat for HAP with Vanc/Zosyn
 d/c zosyn once
   more stable.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: likely pre-renal from sepsis/hypotension.  UOP has
   dropped off this morning, and now with rising Cr/lactate.  Added
   vasopressin for second pressor and goal of improved renal perfusion.
   Goal MAP of 70 for today.
   1.        Follow Cr.
   .
   Biliary stricture: Patient with recent admission for painless jaudince
   requiring biliary stent and sphincterotomy.  Patient due to stent
   change in [**2155-6-1**].  Patient does not appear to have clinical signs of
   cholangitis at this point.
   1.        NPO for now
   2.        Trend LFTs
   3.        empirically treat with Zosyn for biliary organisms
   .
   CAD: MI in [**2106**]'s.  Give high dose ASA.  Enzymes negative x1 - and with
   negative set at OSH more than 12 hours apart.  No need to cycle
   further.
   .
   PUMP: Hold antihypertensives, pressors as needed.  Will repeat ECHO.
   Patient grossly volume overloaded, and may require aggressive diuresis
   once he's off pressors.
   .
   RHYTHM: known afib on coumadin.  Hold coumadin. Rate much improved
   after switch to neosynephrine.
   .
   ARF: Cr up to 1.9 from basline.
   1.        urine lytes show FENA 0.2%, pre-renal vs ATN in setting
   hypotension
   .
   Nutrition: Consult for low albumin.
   1.             Would restart regular diet if possible although with
   respiratory status.  Discuss goals of care with family.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male admitted to the ICU with septic shock, hypoxia, and acute renal failure. He has a history of pancreatic cancer and has undergone ERCP with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement. The patient has a large right pleural effusion causing complete collapse of the right lung, and a moderate left pleural effusion causing complete atelectasis of the basilar left lower lobe segments. He has a MRSA bacteremia and is being treated with vancomycin and Zosyn.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia and pleural effusions increase the risk of respiratory failure, which could lead to intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock and MRSA bacteremia increase the risk of sepsis, which could lead to organ failure and death.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's pre-renal acute renal failure and rising creatinine levels increase the risk of worsening kidney function and potentially leading to end-stage renal disease.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of MI and CAD increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias and heart failure.
5. Infection: The patient's MRSA bacteremia and pleural effusions increase the risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
6. Nutritional Complications: The patient's low albumin levels and respiratory status increase the risk of nutritional complications, such as malnutrition and impaired wound healing.
7. Wound Complications: The patient's surgical wounds and pleural effusions increase the risk of wound complications, such as infection and dehiscence.
8. Endocarditis: The patient's MRSA bacteremia and history of MI increase the risk of endocarditis, which could lead to valve damage and potentially life-threatening complications.

Given the patient's complex medical status and multiple potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor his condition and adjust his treatment plan as needed to prevent and manage these complications."

   -Family  meeting held with daughters where the decision was made to
   make him DNR/DNI, with NO escalation of care (ie, no new invasive
   procedures/ or work-ups).  Basically he was given a very poor prognosis
   with months to live from his gastroenterologist as he has pancreatic
   cancer.  He does not know this diagnosis yet, only his daughters do, so
   they were very reasonable about goals of care.  They will get back to
   us on possibly making him CMO, and would like input from his GI doctor
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2655**], whom I emailed
   -Blood cultures came back 4/4 bottles with MRSA
   -We were unable to wean pressors due to low MAPs
   -We got a CT to better characterize his pleural effusion on CXR, and it
   showed a white out of the right lung with effusion, and a complete lung
   collapse with mucous plugging.

   1. No evidence of pneumonia. Large right pleural effusion causing
   complete
   collapse of the right lung, which was previously partially aerated.
   Component
   of mucus plugging may be superimposed and continued radiographic
   follow-up
   needed. Moderate left pleural effusion causing complete atelectasis of
   the
   basilar left lower lobe segments. Right chest wall edema.
   2. Atherosclerotic calcifications within the aorta and coronary
   circulation.
   3. Interval increase in intra-abdominal ascites, with resolution of
   previously identified intrahepatic biliary dilatation and stable
   appearance to
   simple and hyperdense renal lesions better described on previously
   performed
   dedicated CT abdomen. Pancreatic ductal dilatation persists.
   Microbiology: VRE Swab: Positive
   Blood: MRSA [**4-4**] from [**2155-5-9**]
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 82 M w/ recent admission for painless jaundice s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy and biliary stent c/b hypoxia requiring intubation,
   admitted with septic shock
   .
   Septic Shock: On admission was febrile, WBC > 30 with bandemia,
   tachycardic, increased RR.  Now with GPC in blood.  Unclear source, but
   must consider endocarditis, pulmonary, decubiti or GI source given
   recent diarrhea.  Patient without abdominal pain or jaundice to suggest
   acute cholangitis.
   f/u Sputum, Blood, Urine Cx, Cdiff x 3 - MRSA+ Bacteremia - unclear
   source, ? parapneumonic effusion, endocarditis, complication of biliary
   stent placement.
   1.        Will treat broadly with Vanc/Zosyn/PO Vanco for C. Diff -
   consider d/c zosyn today.
   2.        Titrate CVP to 10, bolus as needed
   3.        Switched to phenylephrine to avoid beta adrtenergic effect of
   levophed and resulting tachycardia.  Added vasopressin this AM.  Check
   Mixed Venous O2 sat.  Adjust PRN.  Might need dobutamine for inotrpoic
   support.
   4.        Transfuse as needed for Hct>30 if MvO2 is < 70%
   5.        Basal cortisol level wnl, no [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   6.        Line re-positioned, f/u culture of tip although unlikely
   source as placed less than 36 hours ago at OSH.
   7.        TTE for endocarditis.  If negative would get CT Scan
   chest/abdomen looking for abdomen.  ?osteo underlying wounds.
   8.        Wound care consult.
   9.        CT Chest today for ? effusion/pneumonia.
   .
   Hypoxia: Patient comfortable on 6L.  He is willing to be intubated.
   Hypoxia likely a result of pleural effusions, sepsis, volume
   recuscitation.
   1.        ABG this AM 7.35/45/132
   2.        Continue nasal cannula at this point.
   3.        Daily CXR
   4.        Add nebulizer prn
   .
   Pleural effusions: may be malignant pleural effusions vs. chf vs. pna
   1.        ECHO, cycle enzymes, daily EKG
   2.        Empirically treat for HAP with Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: likely pre-renal from sepsis/hypotension.  UOP has
   dropped off this morning, and now with rising Cr/lactate.  Added
   vasopressin for second pressor and goal of improved renal perfusion.
   Goal MAP of 70 for today.
   1.        Follow Cr.
   .
   Biliary stricture: Patient with recent admission for painless jaudince
   requiring biliary stent and sphincterotomy.  Patient due to stent
   change in [**2155-6-1**].  Patient does not appear to have clinical signs of
   cholangitis at this point.
   1.        NPO for now
   2.        Trend LFTs
   3.        empirically treat with Zosyn for biliary organisms
   .
   CAD: MI in [**2106**]'s.  Give high dose ASA.  Enzymes negative x1 - and with
   negative set at OSH more than 12 hours apart.  No need to cycle
   further.
   .
   PUMP: Hold antihypertensives, pressors as needed.  Will repeat ECHO.
   Patient grossly volume overloaded, and may require aggressive diuresis
   once he's off pressors.
   .
   RHYTHM: known afib on coumadin.  Hold coumadin. Rate much improved
   after switch to neosynephrine.
   .
   ARF: Cr up to 1.9 from basline.
   1.        urine lytes show FENA 0.2%, pre-renal vs ATN in setting
   hypotension
   .
   Nutrition: Consult this AM for low albumin.
   1.        Would restart regular diet if possible although with
   respiratory status.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male admitted to the ICU with septic shock, MRSA bacteremia, and a large right pleural effusion causing complete collapse of the right lung. He has a history of pancreatic cancer and has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. His vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 114 beats per minute, blood pressure of 93/66 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 77%. He has a white blood cell count of 23.1 K/uL and a creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL. He is receiving vasopressin and phenylephrine to support his blood pressure and is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for his MRSA bacteremia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's large pleural effusion and complete collapse of the right lung may lead to respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by his septic shock and hypoxia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's MRSA bacteremia and septic shock may lead to further organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL suggests acute kidney injury, which may be pre-renal in origin due to his sepsis and hypotension.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and history of myocardial infarction may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent admission for painless jaundice and sphincterotomy may increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as cholangitis or pancreatitis.
6. Infection: The patient's MRSA bacteremia and septic shock may increase his risk of developing further infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
7. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to renal failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of atherosclerotic calcifications and coronary circulation may increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve his chances of survival."

   Imaging: CT Chest
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No evidence of pneumonia. Large right pleural effusion causing
   complete
   collapse of the right lung, which was previously partially aerated.
   Component
   of mucus plugging may be superimposed and continued radiographic
   follow-up
   needed. Moderate left pleural effusion causing complete atelectasis of
   the
   basilar left lower lobe segments. Right chest wall edema.
   2. Atherosclerotic calcifications within the aorta and coronary
   circulation.
   3. Interval increase in intra-abdominal ascites, with resolution of
   previously identified intrahepatic biliary dilatation and stable
   appearance to
   simple and hyperdense renal lesions better described on previously
   performed
   dedicated CT abdomen. Pancreatic ductal dilatation persists.
   Microbiology: VRE Swab: Positive
   Blood: MRSA [**4-4**] from [**2155-5-9**]
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 82 M w/ recent admission for painless jaundice s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy and biliary stent c/b hypoxia requiring intubation,
   admitted with septic shock
   .
   Septic Shock: On admission was febrile, WBC > 30 with bandemia,
   tachycardic, increased RR.  Now with GPC in blood.  Unclear source, but
   must consider endocarditis, pulmonary, decubiti or GI source given
   recent instrumentation.  Patient without abdominal pain or jaundice to
   suggest acute cholangitis.
   .
   f/u Sputum, Blood, Urine Cx, Cdiff x 3 - MRSA+ Bacteremia - unclear
   source, ? parapneumonic effusion, endocarditis, complication of biliary
   stent placement.
   1.        Will treat broadly with Vanc/Zosyn/PO Vanco for C. Diff -
   consider d/c zosyn today.
   2.        Titrate CVP to 10, bolus as needed
   3.        Switched to phenylephrine to avoid beta adrtenergic effect of
   levophed and resulting tachycardia.  Added vasopressin this AM.  Check
   Mixed Venous O2 sat.  Adjust PRN.  Might need dobutamine for inotrpoic
   support.
   4.        Transfuse as needed for Hct>30 if MvO2 is < 70%
   5.        Basal cortisol level wnl, no [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   6.        Line re-positioned, f/u culture of tip although unlikely
   source as placed less than 36 hours ago at OSH.
   7.        TTE for endocarditis.  If negative would get CT Scan
   chest/abdomen looking for abdomen.  ?osteo underlying wounds.
   8.        Wound care consult.
   9.        CT Chest today for ? effusion/pneumonia.
   .
   Hypoxia: Patient comfortable on 6L.  He is willing to be intubated.
   Hypoxia likely a result of pleural effusions, sepsis, volume
   recuscitation.
   1.        ABG this AM 7.35/45/132
   2.        Continue nasal cannula at this point.
   3.        Daily CXR
   4.        Add nebulizer prn
   .
   Pleural effusions: may be malignant pleural effusions vs. chf vs. pna
   1.        ECHO, cycle enzymes, daily EKG
   2.        Empirically treat for HAP with Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: likely pre-renal from sepsis/hypotension.  UOP has
   dropped off this morning, and now with rising Cr/lactate.  Added
   vasopressin for second pressor and goal of improved renal perfusion.
   Goal MAP of 70 for today.
   1.        Follow Cr.
   .
   Biliary stricture: Patient with recent admission for painless jaudince
   requiring biliary stent and sphincterotomy.  Patient due to stent
   change in [**2155-6-1**].  Patient does not appear to have clinical signs of
   cholangitis at this point.
   1.        NPO for now
   2.        Trend LFTs
   3.        empirically treat with Zosyn for biliary organisms
   .
   CAD: MI in [**2106**]'s.  Give high dose ASA.  Enzymes negative x1 - and with
   negative set at OSH more than 12 hours apart.  No need to cycle
   further.
   .
   PUMP: Hold antihypertensives, pressors as needed.  Will repeat ECHO.
   Patient grossly volume overloaded, and may require aggressive diuresis
   once he's off pressors.
   .
   RHYTHM: known afib on coumadin.  Hold coumadin. Rate much improved
   after switch to neosynephrine.
   .
   ARF: Cr up to 1.9 from basline.
   1.        urine lytes show FENA 0.2%, pre-renal vs ATN in setting
   hypotension
   .
   Nutrition: Consult this AM for low albumin.
   1.        Would restart regular diet if possible although with
   respiratory status.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   -Family  meeting held with daughters where the decision was made to
   make him DNR/DNI, with NO escalation of care (ie, no new invasive
   procedures/ or work-ups).  Basically he was given a very poor prognosis
   with months to live from his gastroenterologist as he has pancreatic
   cancer.  He does not know this diagnosis yet, only his daughters do, so
   they were very reasonable about goals of care.  They will get back to
   us on possibly making him CMO, and would like input from his GI doctor
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2655**], whom I emailed
   -Blood cultures came back 4/4 bottles with MRSA
   -We were unable to wean pressors due to low MAPs
   -We got a CT to better characterize his pleural effusion on CXR, and it
   showed a white out of the right lung with effusion, and a complete lung
   collapse with mucous plugging.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 82-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of MRSA bacteremia, septic shock, and acute renal failure. The patient has a history of pancreatic cancer and has been treated with antibiotics, including metronidazole, piperacillin, and vancomycin.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T = 35.6°C, HR = 114 bpm, BP = 93/66 mmHg, RR = 16 breaths/min, SpO2 = 77%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP = 7 mmHg, MAP = 70 mmHg
* Fluid balance: Total In = 2,872 mL, Total Out = 353 mL, Balance = 2,519 mL
* Respiratory support: O2 delivery device = face tent, SpO2 = 77%
* Laboratory results:
	+ WBC = 23.1 K/uL
	+ Hct = 41.1%
	+ Plt = 309 K/uL
	+ Cr = 2.4 mg/dL
	+ TropT = 0.01 ng/mL
	+ TCO2 = 26 mmHg
	+ Glucose = 167 mg/dL
	+ Other labs: PT/PTT/INR = 32.6/38.0/3.4, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T = 35/3/0.01, ALT/AST = 63/168, Alk Phos/T Bili = 342/2.1

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including:

* Large right pleural effusion causing complete collapse of the right lung
* Moderate left pleural effusion causing complete atelectasis of the basilar left lower lobe segments
* Atherosclerotic calcifications within the aorta and coronary circulation
* Interval increase in intra-abdominal ascites
* Pancreatic ductal dilatation persists
* MRSA bacteremia

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn/PO Vanco) for C. Diff and MRSA
* Titration of CVP to 10, bolus as needed
* Switched to phenylephrine to avoid beta-adrenergic effect of levophed and resulting tachycardia
* Added vasopressin for second pressor and goal of improved renal perfusion
* Transfusion as needed for Hct > 30 if MvO2 is < 70%
* Basal cortisol level normal, no [Last Name (un) 45] stim
* Line re-positioned, f/u culture of tip although unlikely source as placed less than 36 hours ago at OSH
* TTE for endocarditis, if negative, get CT Scan chest/abdomen looking for abdomen,? osteo underlying wounds
* Wound care consult
* CT Chest today for? effusion/pneumonia

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis and septic shock
* Acute renal failure
* Hypoxia and respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest
* Intra-abdominal abscess or perforation
* Pancreatic ductal dilatation and pancreatitis
* Atherosclerotic calcifications and coronary artery disease
* Pleural effusions and respiratory failure
* Endocarditis and cardiac valve disease
* Osteomyelitis and underlying bone disease"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and recent ERCP with sphincterotomy and biliary stent for a high-grade stricture of the common bile duct. He presented to the hospital with septic shock, leukocytosis, and hypoxemia. He was intubated and required pressors for 48 hours. He has a MRSA bacteremia and possible sources of infection include the bowel and skin. He also has a large right-sided effusion and partial left-sided effusion with collapse.

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including:

1. Shock: Presumed sepsis with leukocytosis and bandemia, and initial central venous oxygen saturation (CvO2) of 75.
2. Hypoxemia: Due to pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, and probable pneumonia.
3. Metabolic acidosis: Due to sepsis and renal failure.
4. Oliguric acute renal failure (ARF): Likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or intravascular depletion from sepsis.
5. Leukocytosis: Trending down, but continuing broad coverage including C. difficile.
6. Sacral and bilateral heel decubitus ulcers: Requiring wound care.
7. Coronary artery disease: Continuing aspirin and holding beta blockers and ACE inhibitors while requiring pressors.
8. Fasting: Due to hypoxemia requiring significant supplemental oxygen.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: Continued spread of MRSA bacteremia and possible development of other infections.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Due to hypoxemia and pleural effusions.
3. Renal failure: Continued decline in renal function, possibly requiring dialysis.
4. Cardiac complications: Continued arrhythmias and potential cardiac tamponade due to the large right-sided effusion.
5. Wound complications: Development of infections or further tissue damage in the sacral and bilateral heel decubitus ulcers.
6. C. difficile infection: Continued risk of C. difficile infection despite negative stool cultures.
7. Pneumonia: Continued risk of pneumonia due to the patient's immunocompromised state and possible aspiration of oral secretions.
8. Metabolic acidosis: Continued risk of metabolic acidosis due to sepsis and renal failure.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and recent ERCP with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement, was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, MRSA bacteremia, and leukocytosis. The patient had undergone ERCP with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement 48 hours prior to admission, which was complicated by shock, intubation, and pressor requirements.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Tachypnea, hypoxemia, and diminished breath sounds throughout the chest with a large right pleural effusion causing complete collapse of the right lung and moderate left pleural effusion causing complete atelectasis of the basilar left lower lobe segments.
* Cardiovascular: Presumed sepsis with leukocytosis and initial CvO2 75, blood cultures positive for MRSA, and concerns for c diff.
* Metabolic: Metabolic acidosis likely from sepsis, progressive renal failure, and lactate acidosis.
* Renal: Acute renal failure (ARF) likely due to ATN/intravascular depletion from sepsis, with urine lytes appearing pre-renal.
* Hemodynamic: Shock, requiring pressors and intubation, with a CVP goal of at least 10.
* Neurological: Attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis and septic shock due to MRSA bacteremia and leukocytosis.
2. Respiratory failure due to hypoxemia, pleural effusions, and pulmonary edema.
3. Cardiac complications such as atrial fibrillation, cardiac enzymes negative, and concerns for tamponade.
4. Metabolic acidosis and progressive renal failure.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to ATN/intravascular depletion from sepsis.
6. Leukocytosis and concerns for c diff.
7. Gastrointestinal complications such as diarrhea and wound care issues.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue pressors (Neo and vaso) to maintain blood pressure.
2. Bolus IVF for CVP goal of at least 10.
3. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (Zosyn/IV vanco/po vanco) to cover MRSA and c diff.
4. Follow-up cxs (including from OSH) and c diff.
5. TTE to assess cardiac function and rule out tamponade.
6. Trend lactate and support BP.
7. Renally dose meds.
8. Continue broad coverage including empiric for c diff.
9. Hold BB and ACEI while requiring pressors.
10. Continue asa.

The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is critical, with the patient remaining in the ICU. The family has been updated on the patient's condition and goals of care."

   Final Report
   HISTORY: Bilateral pleural effusions. Evaluate for underlying
   pneumonia.
   TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the chest
   without
   intravenous contrast. Contrast was withheld due to elevated BUN and
   creatinine levels. 5-mm, 1.25-mm, and coronal reformations were
   evaluated.
   CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST
   Comparison is made to multiple prior radiograph and prior CTA dated
   [**2155-4-15**].
   FINDINGS: The entire right lung is collapsed, and there is a large
   right
   simple pleural effusion occupying the entire right hemithorax, with
   fluid
   extension into the lateral chest wall. The left upper lobe, lingula,
   and
   superior segment of the left lower lobe remain aerated, with the
   basilar
   segments displaying atelectasis due to compression from an adjacent
   moderate
   simple left pleural effusion. The aerated lung appears clear, and
   without
   evidence of pneumonia. No pathologically enlarged central or axillary
   lymph
   nodes are identified. Secretions are noted within the central airway.
   There is
   a small pericardial effusion and atherosclerotic calcification noted
   within
   the right and left coronary circulation and aortic root and valve. The
   main
   pulmonary artery and right pulmonary artery are dilated, measuring
   greater
   than 3 cm, likely related to elevated pressures from the large
   effusions and
   atelectasis. Right IJ catheter terminates in the mid SVC.
   This examination was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation. The
   imaged
   portion of the upper abdomen displays placement of a biliary stent with
   significant improvement/resolution of intrahepatic biliary ductal
   dilatation,
   but persistent pancreatic ductal dilatation and stable appearance to
   duodenal
   diverticulum, large simple exophytic left upper pole renal cyst, and
   hyperdense right interpolar 2 cm renal cyst. The degree of ascites
   within the
   abdomen is slightly increased from [**2155-4-15**] exam.
   BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative changes of the glenohumeral joint are noted
   bilaterally. There are multilevel degenerative changes within the
   spine. No
   malignant-appearing osseous lesions are identified.
   CT Chest Impression:
   .
   1. No evidence of pneumonia. Large right pleural effusion causing
   complete
   collapse of the right lung, which was previously partially aerated.
   Component
   of mucus plugging may be superimposed and continued radiographic
   follow-up
   needed. Moderate left pleural effusion causing complete atelectasis of
   the
   basilar left lower lobe segments. Right chest wall edema.
   .
   2. Atherosclerotic calcifications within the aorta and coronary
   circulation.
   .
   3. Interval increase in intra-abdominal ascites, with resolution of
   previously identified intrahepatic biliary dilatation and stable
   appearance to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Final Report
   HISTORY: Bilateral pleural effusions. Evaluate for underlying
   pneumonia.
   TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the chest
   without
   intravenous contrast. Contrast was withheld due to elevated BUN and
   creatinine levels. 5-mm, 1.25-mm, and coronal reformations were
   evaluated.
   CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST
   Comparison is made to multiple prior radiograph and prior CTA dated
   [**2155-4-15**].
   FINDINGS: The entire right lung is collapsed, and there is a large
   right
   simple pleural effusion occupying the entire right hemithorax, with
   fluid
   extension into the lateral chest wall. The left upper lobe, lingula,
   and
   superior segment of the left lower lobe remain aerated, with the
   basilar
   segments displaying atelectasis due to compression from an adjacent
   moderate
   simple left pleural effusion. The aerated lung appears clear, and
   without
   evidence of pneumonia. No pathologically enlarged central or axillary
   lymph
   nodes are identified. Secretions are noted within the central airway.
   There is
   a small pericardial effusion and atherosclerotic calcification noted

   effusions and
   atelectasis. Right IJ catheter terminates in the mid SVC.
   This examination was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation. The

   significant improvement/resolution of intrahepatic biliary ductal
   dilatation,
   but persistent pancreatic ductal dilatation and stable appearance to

   hyperdense right interpolar 2 cm renal cyst. The degree of ascites
   within the
   abdomen is slightly increased from [**2155-4-15**] exam.
   BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative changes of the glenohumeral joint are noted
   bilaterally. There are multilevel degenerative changes within the
   spine. No
   malignant-appearing osseous lesions are identified.
   CT Chest Impression:

* White blood cell count: 23.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 12.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 309 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.9 mg/dL

* Albumin: 1.9 g/dL
* LDH: 221 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.5 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL
* PO4: 5.9 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CT chest: bilateral pleural effusions, atherosclerotic calcifications in the aorta and coronary circulation, and a small pericardial effusion.
* TTE: suboptimal image quality, but shows depressed LV systolic function and a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Potential medical complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock is likely due to MRSA bacteremia, and may worsen if not treated promptly.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely pre-renal in origin, and may require aggressive diuresis once he is off pressors.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to bilateral pleural effusions, and may require thoracentesis or other interventions to improve lung expansion.
4. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to pleural effusions, sepsis, and volume resuscitation, and may require ongoing monitoring and treatment.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of MI and known AFib on coumadin may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
6. Biliary complications: The patient's recent ERCP and sphincterotomy may increase his risk of biliary complications, such as cholangitis or bile duct stricture.
7. Nutritional complications: The patient's low albumin and respiratory status may increase his risk of nutritional complications, such as malnutrition or refeeding syndrome."

   Final Report
   HISTORY: Bilateral pleural effusions. Evaluate for underlying
   pneumonia.
   TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the chest
   without
   intravenous contrast. Contrast was withheld due to elevated BUN and
   creatinine levels. 5-mm, 1.25-mm, and coronal reformations were
   evaluated.
   CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST
   Comparison is made to multiple prior radiograph and prior CTA dated
   [**2155-4-15**].
   FINDINGS: The entire right lung is collapsed, and there is a large
   right
   simple pleural effusion occupying the entire right hemithorax, with
   fluid
   extension into the lateral chest wall. The left upper lobe, lingula,
   and
   superior segment of the left lower lobe remain aerated, with the
   basilar
   segments displaying atelectasis due to compression from an adjacent
   moderate
   simple left pleural effusion. The aerated lung appears clear, and
   without
   evidence of pneumonia. No pathologically enlarged central or axillary
   lymph
   nodes are identified. Secretions are noted within the central airway.
   There is
   a small pericardial effusion and atherosclerotic calcification noted
   within
   the right and left coronary circulation and aortic root and valve. The
   main
   pulmonary artery and right pulmonary artery are dilated, measuring
   greater
   than 3 cm, likely related to elevated pressures from the large
   effusions and
   atelectasis. Right IJ catheter terminates in the mid SVC.
   This examination was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation. The
   imaged
   portion of the upper abdomen displays placement of a biliary stent with
   significant improvement/resolution of intrahepatic biliary ductal
   dilatation,
   but persistent pancreatic ductal dilatation and stable appearance to
   duodenal
   diverticulum, large simple exophytic left upper pole renal cyst, and
   hyperdense right interpolar 2 cm renal cyst. The degree of ascites
   within the
   abdomen is slightly increased from [**2155-4-15**] exam.
   BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative changes of the glenohumeral joint are noted
   bilaterally. There are multilevel degenerative changes within the
   spine. No
   malignant-appearing osseous lesions are identified.
   CT Chest Impression:
   .
   1. No evidence of pneumonia. Large right pleural effusion causing
   complete
   collapse of the right lung, which was previously partially aerated.
   Component
   of mucus plugging may be superimposed and continued radiographic
   follow-up
   needed. Moderate left pleural effusion causing complete atelectasis of
   the
   basilar left lower lobe segments. Right chest wall edema.
   .
   2. Atherosclerotic calcifications within the aorta and coronary
   circulation.
   .
   3. Interval increase in intra-abdominal ascites, with resolution of
   previously identified intrahepatic biliary dilatation and stable
   appearance to
   simple and hyperdense renal lesions better described on previously
   performed
   dedicated CT abdomen. Pancreatic ductal dilatation persists.
   Microbiology: BCx: [**5-9**] + MRSA

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 82 M w/ recent admission for painless jaundice s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy and biliary stent c/b hypoxia requiring intubation,
   admitted with septic shock
   .
   Septic Shock: On admission was febrile, WBC > 30 with bandemia,
   tachycardic, increased RR.  Now with GPC in blood.  Unclear source, but
   must consider endocarditis, pulmonary, decubiti or GI source given
   recent instrumentation.  Patient without abdominal pain or jaundice to
   suggest acute cholangitis.
   .
   Goals of Care: Will need to meet with family today to discuss goals of
   care
 currently no escalation of care.
   .
   f/u Sputum, Blood, Urine Cx, Cdiff x 3 - MRSA+ Bacteremia - unclear
   source, ? parapneumonic effusion, endocarditis, complication of biliary
   stent placement.
   1.        Will treat broadly with Vanc/Zosyn/PO Vanco for C. Diff -
   consider d/c zosyn today as empirirc.
   2.        Titrate CVP to 10, bolus as needed, repeat venous O2 sat.
   3.        Switched to phenylephrine to avoid beta adrtenergic effect of
   levophed and resulting tachycardia.  Added vasopressin.  Check Mixed
   Venous O2 sat.  Adjust PRN.  Might need dobutamine for inotrpoic
   support but would defer at this time.
   4.        Transfuse as needed for Hct>30 if MvO2 is < 70%.
   5.        Basal cortisol level wnl, no [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   6.        Line re-positioned, f/u culture of tip.
   7.        TTE for endocarditis -> limited study.
   8.        Wound care consult.
   9.        Consider thoracentesis of effusion, imaging of abdomen.
   .
   Mental Status: With delerium on exam today.  Likely [**2-1**] to worsening
   renal failure, uremia, infection and other toxic derrangements.
   1.       Need to discuss goals of care with family.
   2.       Treat underlying infectious processes.
   3.       Hydrate, if oliguria persists may need CVVH/HD.
   .
   Hypoxia: Patient comfortable on 6L.  He is willing to be intubated.
   Hypoxia likely a result of pleural effusions, sepsis, volume
   recuscitation.
   1.        ABG this AM 7.35/45/132
   2.        Continue nasal cannula at this point.
   3.        Daily CXR
   4.        Add nebulizer prn
   .
   Pleural effusions: may be malignant pleural effusions vs. chf vs. pna
   1.        ECHO, cycle enzymes, daily EKG
   2.        Empirically treat for HAP with Vanc/Zosyn
 d/c zosyn once
   more stable.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: likely pre-renal from sepsis/hypotension.  UOP has
   dropped off this morning, and now with rising Cr/lactate.  Added
   vasopressin for second pressor and goal of improved renal perfusion.
   Goal MAP of 70 for today.
   1.             Follow Cr.
   2.             Urine Lytes from [**5-11**] were Pre-Renal.  Maintain
   adequate CVP goal 10.
   .
   Biliary stricture: Patient with recent admission for painless jaudince
   requiring biliary stent and sphincterotomy.  Patient due to stent
   change in [**2155-6-1**].  Patient does not appear to have clinical signs of
   cholangitis at this point.
   1.        NPO for now
   2.        Trend LFTs
   3.        empirically treat with Zosyn for biliary organisms
   .
   CAD: MI in [**2106**]'s.  Give high dose ASA.  Enzymes negative x1 - and with
   negative set at OSH more than 12 hours apart.  No need to cycle
   further.
   .
   PUMP: Hold antihypertensives, pressors as needed.  Will repeat ECHO.
   Patient grossly volume overloaded, and may require aggressive diuresis
   once he's off pressors.
   .
   RHYTHM: known afib on coumadin.  Hold coumadin. Rate much improved
   after switch to neosynephrine.
   .
   ARF: Cr up to 1.9 from basline.

   Final Report
   HISTORY: Bilateral pleural effusions. Evaluate for underlying
   pneumonia.
   TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the chest
   without
   intravenous contrast. Contrast was withheld due to elevated BUN and
   creatinine levels. 5-mm, 1.25-mm, and coronal reformations were
   evaluated.
   CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST
   Comparison is made to multiple prior radiograph and prior CTA dated
   [**2155-4-15**].
   FINDINGS: The entire right lung is collapsed, and there is a large
   right
   simple pleural effusion occupying the entire right hemithorax, with
   fluid
   extension into the lateral chest wall. The left upper lobe, lingula,
   and
   superior segment of the left lower lobe remain aerated, with the
   basilar
   segments displaying atelectasis due to compression from an adjacent
   moderate
   simple left pleural effusion. The aerated lung appears clear, and
   without
   evidence of pneumonia. No pathologically enlarged central or axillary
   lymph
   nodes are identified. Secretions are noted within the central airway.
   There is
   a small pericardial effusion and atherosclerotic calcification noted
   within
   the right and left coronary circulation and aortic root and valve. The
   main
   pulmonary artery and right pulmonary artery are dilated, measuring
   greater
   than 3 cm, likely related to elevated pressures from the large
   effusions and
   atelectasis. Right IJ catheter terminates in the mid SVC.
   This examination was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation. The
   imaged
   portion of the upper abdomen displays placement of a biliary stent with
   significant improvement/resolution of intrahepatic biliary ductal
   dilatation,
   but persistent pancreatic ductal dilatation and stable appearance to
   duodenal
   diverticulum, large simple exophytic left upper pole renal cyst, and
   hyperdense right interpolar 2 cm renal cyst. The degree of ascites
   within the
   abdomen is slightly increased from [**2155-4-15**] exam.
   BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative changes of the glenohumeral joint are noted
   bilaterally. There are multilevel degenerative changes within the
   spine. No
   malignant-appearing osseous lesions are identified.
   CT Chest Impression:
   .
   1. No evidence of pneumonia. Large right pleural effusion causing
   complete
   collapse of the right lung, which was previously partially aerated.
   Component
   of mucus plugging may be superimposed and continued radiographic
   follow-up
   needed. Moderate left pleural effusion causing complete atelectasis of
   the
   basilar left lower lobe segments. Right chest wall edema.
   .
   2. Atherosclerotic calcifications within the aorta and coronary
   circulation.
   .
   3. Interval increase in intra-abdominal ascites, with resolution of
   previously identified intrahepatic biliary dilatation and stable
   appearance to
   simple and hyperdense renal lesions better described on previously
   performed
   dedicated CT abdomen. Pancreatic ductal dilatation persists.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male admitted to the ICU with septic shock, hypoxia, and acute renal failure. He has a history of painless jaundice and underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement. He was intubated due to hypoxia and is currently receiving vasopressors and mechanical ventilation. The patient has a positive blood culture for MRSA and is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Endocarditis: The patient's MRSA bacteremia and positive blood culture may indicate the presence of endocarditis, which can lead to serious complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and embolization.
2. Pulmonary complications: The patient's hypoxia and pleural effusions may lead to respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels and oliguria may indicate acute renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and require dialysis.
4. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock and bacteremia may lead to further organ dysfunction, including cardiovascular, respiratory, and hepatic failure.
5. Biliary complications: The patient's biliary stent and sphincterotomy may lead to complications such as cholangitis, cholecystitis, or bile leak.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of MI and current use of vasopressors may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's delirium and altered mental status may be due to sepsis, hypoxia, or other underlying medical conditions, which can lead to further neurological deterioration.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for MRSA and consider adding coverage for other potential pathogens.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, and adjust vasopressors as needed.
3. Consider performing a thoracentesis to drain the pleural effusions and improve lung expansion.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and consider initiating dialysis if necessary.
5. Consider performing a TTE to evaluate for endocarditis and other cardiac complications.
6. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider sedation or analgesia as needed to manage delirium.
7. Consult with a nephrologist and a cardiologist to optimize the patient's care and management."

   a small pericardial effusion and atherosclerotic calcification noted
   within
   the right and left coronary circulation and aortic root and valve. The
   main
   pulmonary artery and right pulmonary artery are dilated, measuring
   greater
   than 3 cm, likely related to elevated pressures from the large
   effusions and
   atelectasis. Right IJ catheter terminates in the mid SVC.

   dilatation,
   but persistent pancreatic ductal dilatation and stable appearance to
   duodenal
   diverticulum, large simple exophytic left upper pole renal cyst, and
   hyperdense right interpolar 2 cm renal cyst. The degree of ascites
   within the
   abdomen is slightly increased from [**2155-4-15**] exam.
   BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative changes of the glenohumeral joint are noted

   1. No evidence of pneumonia. Large right pleural effusion causing
   complete
   collapse of the right lung, which was previously partially aerated.
   Component
   of mucus plugging may be superimposed and continued radiographic
   follow-up
   needed. Moderate left pleural effusion causing complete atelectasis of
   the
   basilar left lower lobe segments. Right chest wall edema.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Final Report
   HISTORY: Bilateral pleural effusions. Evaluate for underlying
   pneumonia.
   TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the chest
   without
   intravenous contrast. Contrast was withheld due to elevated BUN and
   creatinine levels. 5-mm, 1.25-mm, and coronal reformations were
   evaluated.
   CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST
   Comparison is made to multiple prior radiograph and prior CTA dated
   [**2155-4-15**].
   FINDINGS: The entire right lung is collapsed, and there is a large
   right
   simple pleural effusion occupying the entire right hemithorax, with
   fluid
   extension into the lateral chest wall. The left upper lobe, lingula,
   and
   superior segment of the left lower lobe remain aerated, with the
   basilar
   segments displaying atelectasis due to compression from an adjacent
   moderate
   simple left pleural effusion. The aerated lung appears clear, and
   without
   evidence of pneumonia. No pathologically enlarged central or axillary
   lymph
   nodes are identified. Secretions are noted within the central airway.
   There is
   a small pericardial effusion and atherosclerotic calcification noted
   within
   the right and left coronary circulation and aortic root and valve. The
   main
   pulmonary artery and right pulmonary artery are dilated, measuring
   greater
   than 3 cm, likely related to elevated pressures from the large
   effusions and
   atelectasis. Right IJ catheter terminates in the mid SVC.
   This examination was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation. The
   imaged
   portion of the upper abdomen displays placement of a biliary stent with
   significant improvement/resolution of intrahepatic biliary ductal
   dilatation,
   but persistent pancreatic ductal dilatation and stable appearance to
   duodenal
   diverticulum, large simple exophytic left upper pole renal cyst, and
   hyperdense right interpolar 2 cm renal cyst. The degree of ascites
   within the
   abdomen is slightly increased from [**2155-4-15**] exam.
   BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative changes of the glenohumeral joint are noted
   bilaterally. There are multilevel degenerative changes within the
   spine. No
   malignant-appearing osseous lesions are identified.
   CT Chest Impression:

Summary:

The patient is a 82-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of septic shock, likely due to MRSA bacteremia. He has a history of recent admission for painless jaundice and sphincterotomy with biliary stent placement. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has a large right pleural effusion, moderate left pleural effusion, and ascites in the abdomen. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate, and creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's condition is critical, and there is a high risk of sepsis-related complications, such as organ dysfunction, shock, and death.
2. Pleural effusions: The large right pleural effusion may be causing respiratory compromise, and the moderate left pleural effusion may be contributing to atelectasis and respiratory failure.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and there is a risk of further deterioration in renal function, which may require renal replacement therapy.
4. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is 75%, and there is a risk of further desaturation due to the pleural effusions and respiratory compromise.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and there is a risk of further cardiovascular instability, which may require aggressive treatment with vasopressors and diuretics.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of recent instrumentation, which may have introduced bacteria into the bloodstream, and there is a risk of further infection, particularly endocarditis.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's albumin level is low, and there is a risk of further nutritional deficiencies, particularly protein-energy malnutrition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover MRSA and other potential pathogens.
2. Consider thoracentesis to drain the large right pleural effusion and improve respiratory function.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider renal replacement therapy if necessary.
4. Continue mechanical ventilation and adjust the settings as necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
5. Consider consultation with a cardiothoracic surgeon to evaluate the patient's risk of endocarditis.
6. Consult with a nutritionist to develop a plan for managing the patient's nutritional deficiencies.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular stability and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent further cardiovascular instability."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and recent admission for ERCP with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement for high-grade CBD stricture. He was transferred from another hospital with septic shock from MRSA bacteremia, large bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis, leukocytosis, and progressive acute renal failure (ARF). He is currently intubated and receiving pressors, and has a poor overall prognosis. The patient is experiencing multiorgan failure, including shock, hypoxemia, respiratory distress, ARF, and leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Shock: The patient's shock is likely due to MRSA bacteremia, and the source of the infection is unclear. The patient's recent ERCP procedure and presence of pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis may be contributing factors.
2. Hypoxemia/Respiratory Distress: The patient's pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, and probable pneumonia may be causing his respiratory distress.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is likely due to sepsis and intravascular depletion.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be due to persistent infection, including pleural fluid, sacral decubitus, or C. difficile.
5. Pain: The patient is experiencing significant pain, which is being managed with morphine.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is being held due to pressor requirements.
7. Sacral and Bilateral Heel Decubitus: The patient's decubitus ulcers require wound care.
8. Cardiovascular Disease: The patient's CAD is being managed with holding beta blockers and ACE inhibitors while pressors are required.

Goals of Care:

The patient's family is discussing goals of care and may be moving towards comfort care and not wishing to escalate care or interventions. The patient's overall prognosis is poor, and the team is considering transition from DNR/DNI without escalation to comfort care. Palliative care is being consulted to further assist the family."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with shock, requiring pressors and intubation. He has a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, coronary artery disease, and recent admission with ERCP for a high-grade CBD stricture. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock from MRSA infection with progressive acute renal failure (ARF) and large effusions with compressive atelectasis.

The patient's main issues include:

1. Shock from MRSA bacteremia, which may be due to sources such as lungs, pleural effusions, bowel, or skin.
2. Hypoxemia and respiratory distress due to pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, and probable pneumonia.
3. ARF, likely due to ATN or intravascular depletion from sepsis.
4. Leukocytosis, which may be due to infected pleural fluid, c. diff, or other sources.
5. Afib, which is tolerating neo in terms of rates but is holding BB due to pressor requirements and holding coumadin due to supratherapeutic INR.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Continuing pressors, including Neo and Vasopressin, with weaning as tolerated.
2. Bolus IVF for CVP goal at least 10.
3. Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Zosyn, IV Vancomycin, and PO Vancomycin, with consideration of IV Flagyl pending third c. diff. culture.
4. Tapping effusion and consideration of reimaging of abdomen.
5. Addressing fgoals of care with family, who are moving toward comfort and do not wish for escalation of care or aggressive interventions.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and his disposition is ICU. He is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical issues."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Other laboratory results include elevated liver enzymes, abnormal coagulation studies, and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the absence of peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic assessments.

The patient is receiving the following medications and infusions:

* Morphine sulfate: 5 mg/hour
* Vancomycin: last dose on [**2155-5-12**] 06:19 PM
* Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn): last dose on [**2155-5-13**] 05:49 AM

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction if not effectively managed.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as stroke or arrhythmias.
3. Infections: The patient's sepsis and elevated white blood cell count suggest the presence of an infection, which can lead to further complications if not effectively treated.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is abnormal, with a total input of 339 mL and output of 291 mL, which can lead to fluid overload or dehydration.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's laboratory results show electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or other complications.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation studies are abnormal, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.

Based on this information, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings to ensure effective management of their sepsis and potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, an 82-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with MRSA sepsis and suspected pancreatic cancer. He is currently on a morphine infusion and has a central venous catheter (CVP) in place. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 96.4°F, heart rate of 112 bpm, and blood pressure of 96/70 mmHg. He is on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute. His laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 23.1, hemoglobin of 12.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 309. His creatinine level is elevated at 2.8 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis is not resolving, and he may be at risk for developing sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury or respiratory failure.
2. Pancreatic cancer: The patient's suspected pancreatic cancer may be progressing, and he may be at risk for developing complications such as bowel obstruction, bleeding, or jaundice.
3. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient's central venous catheter (CVP) is at risk for causing a CLABSI, which can lead to bacteremia, sepsis, and organ failure.
4. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk for developing VTE due to his immobility and underlying medical conditions.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and he may be at risk for developing respiratory failure if his oxygen therapy is not optimized.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, and he may be at risk for developing hyperglycemic complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome.
7. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he may be at risk for developing acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status is not optimal, and he may be at risk for developing malnutrition, which can lead to complications such as pressure ulcers, respiratory failure, or impaired wound healing."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Septic shock with continued pressor requirements
* Large bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis and hypoxemia
* Leukocytosis
* Progressive acute renal failure (ARF)
* Pancreatic cancer suspected due to elevated CA [**65**]-9 levels
* Atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 95 beats per minute
* Hypotension with a blood pressure of 96/70 mmHg
* Respiratory support with a nasal cannula and intubation
* Agonal breathing and unresponsive to voice
* Neurological status: unresponsive to voice, agonal

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 12.0 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 23.1 K/uL
* Platelet count: 309 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.8 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.1 mmol/L
* Albumin: 1.9 g/dL
* LDH: 221 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 5.9 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show no new findings. The patient's microbiology results show no new laboratory results.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Discontinuation of antibiotics, pressors, and medications
* Addressing pain and comfort with morphine and ativan as needed
* Oxygen therapy for comfort
* Nutrition: NPO
* Glycemic control: comfort measures only
* ICU care with monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and respiratory support

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to ongoing MRSA bacteremia
* Respiratory failure due to compressive atelectasis and hypoxemia
* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to progressive ARF
* Pancreatic cancer progression and metastasis
* Cardiovascular complications due to atrial fibrillation and underlying coronary artery disease
* Neurological deterioration due to sepsis, hypoxia, and ARF
* Gastrointestinal complications due to ERCP and sphincterotomy"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD) following a myocardial infarction (MI), and recent admission for an ERCP procedure with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement for a high-grade CBD stricture. He developed shock requiring pressors and intubation during the procedure. Brushings were ""atypical"" and CA-9 was very elevated, suspicious for pancreatic cancer.

The patient was transferred from another hospital with septic shock from MRSA bacteremia, large bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis, leukocytosis, and progressive acute renal failure (ARF). He is currently in the ICU with ongoing discussions regarding goals of care and possible transition from DNR/DNI to comfort care due to worsening lethargy, pain, and multiorgan failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Shock: The patient's shock is likely due to MRSA bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure. Continued pressor support and broad-spectrum antibiotics are necessary to manage this condition.
2. Hypoxemia/Respiratory Distress: The patient's bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, and probable pneumonia (pneumonia) can lead to respiratory distress. Ongoing discussions with the family regarding the risks and benefits of potentially therapeutic interventions, such as bronchoscopy, are necessary.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is likely due to ATN/intravascular depletion from sepsis. Renal-dose medications are necessary to manage this condition.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to persistent infection, including pleural fluid, sacral decubitus, and possible C. difficile. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are necessary to manage this condition.
5. Pain: The patient's pain is managed with morphine prn, but ongoing discussions with the family regarding pain management and the risks and benefits of potentially therapeutic interventions are necessary.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with holding beta-blockers due to pressor requirements and supratherapeutic INR.
7. Sacral and Bilateral Heel Decubitus: Wound care is necessary to manage these decubitus ulcers.

In summary, the patient is critically ill with multiorgan failure, and ongoing discussions with the family regarding goals of care and potential transition to comfort care are necessary. Ongoing management of his shock, hypoxemia, ARF, leukocytosis, pain, atrial fibrillation, and decubitus ulcers is crucial to improving his outcomes."
