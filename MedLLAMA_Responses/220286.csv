   Chief Complaint: Encephalopathy
   24 Hour Events:
 PICC LINE - STOP [**2102-10-17**] 06:50 PM
   - 430p labs showing 10pt drop in Na. D5W already finished by this
   point, didn't give more. At baseline poor mental status
   - PICC pulled
   - BP's low through the evening to the 80's, but not tachycardic.
   Watched. Early in am, bp's down to 70's so bolus 500 cc's NS (instead
   of D5W due to Na drop) and started empiric Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro. If
   continued through tomorrow, will need ID approval
   - PM CXR IMPRESSION: Bilateral basal infiltrates, more on the left than
   right, can explain patient's increasing fevers. Observe, however that
   these abnormalities existed already on several previous portable chest
   examinations.
   - Vanc/Zosyn started

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.
   .
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone - clarify date of last dose.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   .
   # Agitation/altered mental status.  Multifactorial delerium -
   electrolyte abnormalities, encephalitis, med related.  Also with some
   chronic narcotic use.
   - Correct lytes
   - Methadone 10 mg TID given chronic pain control issues.
   - Seroquel 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for agitation.
   - Can also give Haldol prn agitation.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Difficulty weaning off vent now s/p trach.
   Seems to desat with plugging/secretions at times.  Atelectasis on
   imaging.  [**Month (only) 11**] be hypoventilating to some degree with sedation meds as
   above. Recent mini-BAL negative. Today tolerating trach mask well.
   - CXR today.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   .
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3); Tmax 102.8
   yesterday.  Blood cultures drawn; urine with a few WBCs.  CXR without
   evidence of infiltrate though was one day prior.
   - Repeat CXR.
   - Sputum culture.
   - Repeat UA with culture.
   - Send C.diff.
   - d/c PICC and send tip culture.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic.
   - Free water in tube feeds doubled today.
   - 1 more liter of D5W today.
   - repeat lytes in PM today.
   .
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - clarify treatment duration with ophthalmology.
   .
   # Elevated LFTs.  Mild yesterday. ?ceftriaxone related.
   - Recheck tomorrow.
   - If still abnormal, check RUQ US.
   .
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; though benign and not
   related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.
   .
   # HTN.  Well controlled on metoprolol; written for prn
   antihypertensives, which we will hold.
   - continue metoprolol.
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted with neurologic changes and diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis. He has a history of hypertension, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and chronic pain. The patient is currently receiving treatment for Lyme disease with ceftriaxone, which is planned for a 4-week course.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues, including:

1. Electrolyte abnormalities: The patient had a 10-point drop in sodium levels, which was treated with D5W and NS infusions.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to difficulty weaning off the ventilator. Atelectasis was noted on imaging, and the patient was desaturating with plugging and secretions.
3. Fever: The patient had daily low-grade temperatures, with a Tmax of 102.8 yesterday. Blood cultures were drawn, and urine cultures were pending.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels were elevated, likely due to iatrogenic causes. Free water was added to the tube feeds, and D5W was administered.
5. Corneal ulcer: The patient developed a corneal ulcer due to inability to protect his eye with neurologic deficits. Vigamox and bacitracin ointment were prescribed.
6. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient's liver enzymes were mildly elevated, and it is unclear if this is related to ceftriaxone treatment. Repeat liver function tests were ordered.
7. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm: The patient developed an accelerated idioventricular rhythm, which was deemed benign and not related to Lyme disease. Metoprolol was continued at current dosing.
8. Agitation and altered mental status: The patient was agitated and had altered mental status, which was multifactorial and included electrolyte abnormalities, encephalitis, and medication-related causes.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these issues include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count increase the risk of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if not properly managed, leading to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
3. Neurologic deficits: The patient's Lyme encephalitis and neurologic deficits can worsen if not properly treated, leading to permanent damage.
4. Infection: The patient's corneal ulcer and respiratory failure increase the risk of infection, which can spread to other parts of the body.
5. Liver damage: The patient's elevated liver enzymes can indicate liver damage, which can worsen if not properly treated.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's accelerated idioventricular rhythm can worsen if not properly managed, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and potential cardiac arrest.

In summary, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   .
   # Hypotension: had period of hypotension overnight with SBPs to 70s.
   Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, zosyn and cipro for a
   presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that should possible
   new RLL infiltrates).  The hypotension also happened soon after
   receiving several medications, and was repeated this morning after
   receiving metoprolol, clonidine, methadone and seroquel.
   - Final read for CXR infiltrates is equivocal and patient was
   afebrile.  It is unclear whether he has a new infection.  Also,
   considering that he was already on ceftriaxone, not sure if adding
   zosyn is useful.  We can continue antibiotics for 48 hours after all
   cultures negative.
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm that would not likely respond to
   metoprolol, but his metoprolol was still increased to 75mg TID.  We
   will reduce his dose to 25mg TID to avoid hypotension.
   .
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Though second CSF serology is equivocal, they definitely feel that
   his picture is
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 22 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   .
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation.
   - Methadone 10 mg TID given chronic pain control issues.
   - Seroquel 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for agitation.
   - Can also give Haldol 2mg prn agitation.
   - Given that nutritional deficits appear very unlikely, we will d/c IV
   thiamine, folate and multivitamin.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Now doing well at 20 hours on trach mask. Seems
   to desat with plugging/secretions at times.  Atelectasis on imaging.
   - f/u CXR read.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).

   yesterday.  Blood cultures drawn; urine with a few WBCs.  CXR without
   evidence of infiltrate though was one day prior.
   - Repeat CXR.
   - Sputum culture.
   - Repeat UA with culture.
   - Send C.diff.
   - d/c PICC and send tip culture.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Improved yesterday.  Will continue to monitor with
   free water boluses w/ tube feeds.
   - Free water in tube feeds doubled yesterday.
   - repeat lytes in PM.

   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   .
   # Elevated LFTs.  Mild yesterday, slightly worsened today.  Unclear
   etiology, possibly due to ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would get ultrasound.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   .
   # Hypotension: had period of hypotension overnight with SBPs to 70s.
   Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, zosyn and cipro for a
   presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that should possible
   new RLL infiltrates).  The hypotension also happened soon after
   receiving several medications, and was repeated this morning after
   receiving metoprolol, clonidine, methadone and seroquel.
   - Final read for CXR infiltrates is equivocal and patient was
   afebrile.  It is unclear whether he has a new infection.  Also,
   considering that he was already on ceftriaxone, not sure if adding
   zosyn is useful.  We can continue antibiotics for 48 hours after all
   cultures negative.
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm that would not likely respond to
   metoprolol, but his metoprolol was still increased to 75mg TID.  We
   will reduce his dose to 25mg TID to avoid hypotension.
   .
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Though second CSF serology is equivocal, they definitely feel that
   his picture is
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 22 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   .
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation.
   - Methadone 10 mg TID given chronic pain control issues.
   - Seroquel 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for agitation.
   - Can also give Haldol 2mg prn agitation.
   - Given that nutritional deficits appear very unlikely, we will d/c IV
   thiamine, folate and multivitamin.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Now doing well at 20 hours on trach mask. Seems
   to desat with plugging/secretions at times.  Atelectasis on imaging.
   - f/u CXR read.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   .
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3); Tmax 102.8
   yesterday.  Blood cultures drawn; urine with a few WBCs.  CXR without
   evidence of infiltrate though was one day prior.
   - Repeat CXR.
   - Sputum culture.
   - Repeat UA with culture.
   - Send C.diff.
   - d/c PICC and send tip culture.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Improved yesterday.  Will continue to monitor with
   free water boluses w/ tube feeds.
   - Free water in tube feeds doubled yesterday.
   - repeat lytes in PM.
   .
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   .
   # Elevated LFTs.  Mild yesterday, slightly worsened today.  Unclear
   etiology, possibly due to ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would get ultrasound.
   .
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, ITP, and lyme encephalitis. He was admitted with neurologic changes and is currently being treated for lyme encephalitis with a 28-day course of ceftriaxone.

The patient has experienced several medical complications, including:

1. Hypotension: The patient had periods of hypotension overnight and in the morning, which responded to IV fluids and treatment with vanc, zosyn, and cipro for a presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia.
2. Altered mental status: The patient has impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, which is primarily due to encephalitis, but could be multifactorial.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on a trach mask and is doing well, but has had episodes of desaturation with plugging/secretions. Atelectasis is present on imaging.
4. Fever: The patient has had daily low-grade temperatures and a Tmax of 102.8 yesterday. Blood cultures have been drawn, and urine cultures have shown a few WBCs.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels have improved, but will continue to be monitored with free water boluses with tube feeds.
6. Corneal ulcer: The patient has a corneal ulcer that is likely related to his neurologic deficits.
7. Elevated LFTs: The patient's liver function tests have worsened slightly, and the etiology is unclear.
8. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm: The patient has an accelerated idioventricular rhythm that is thought to be benign and not related to lyme disease.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Continued treatment for lyme encephalitis with ceftriaxone.
2. Management of hypotension with IV fluids and treatment for pneumonia.
3. Management of altered mental status with PRN haldol and reorientation.
4. Weaning from the ventilator as tolerated.
5. Treatment for respiratory failure with inhaled medications and consideration of tracheostomy.
6. Monitoring of fever and treatment with antibiotics as necessary.
7. Monitoring of hypernatremia and treatment with free water boluses with tube feeds.
8. Treatment of corneal ulcer with vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
9. Monitoring of elevated LFTs and consideration of ultrasound if fevers recur.
10. Management of accelerated idioventricular rhythm with metoprolol.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending clinical improvement, with eventual consideration for rehabilitation screening."

   there is very high suspicion for pseudomonas.  zosyn d/c'ed.
   - was agitated several times.  Got 2mg haldol shortly before 4pm.
   Shortly afterwards he desaturated to the 70s, was bag masked for
   several minutes and a mucus plug was aspirated with improvement in his
   sats.  He then stabilized and was bronched.
   - Started on cefepime because of instability.  Need to contact ID to
   ask whether ceftriaxone can be stopped while cefepime is being given
   (equivalent Lyme coverage?).

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   70s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, zosyn and cipro for a
   presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed possible
   new RLL infiltrates).  The hypotension also happened soon after
   receiving several medications, and was repeated this morning after
   receiving metoprolol, clonidine, methadone and seroquel.
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm that would not likely respond to
   metoprolol, but his metoprolol was still increased to 75mg TID, but now
   decreased to 25mg TID to avoid hypotension.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 24 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation.
   - Methadone 10 mg TID given chronic pain control issues.
   - Seroquel 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for agitation.
   - Can also give Haldol 2mg prn agitation.
   - Given that nutritional deficits appear very unlikely, IV thiamine,
   folate and multivitamin have been d/c'd.
   # Respiratory failure.  Now doing well on trach mask. Seems to desat
   with plugging/secretions at times.  Atelectasis on imaging.
   - f/u CXR read.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3); Tmax 102.8
   yesterday.  Blood cultures drawn; urine with a few WBCs.  CXR without
   evidence of infiltrate though was one day prior.
   - Repeat CXR.
   - Sputum culture.
   - Repeat UA with culture.
   - Send C.diff.
   - d/c PICC and send tip culture.
   # Hypernatremia.  Improved yesterday.  Will continue to monitor with
   free water boluses w/ tube feeds.
   - Free water in tube feeds doubled yesterday.
   - repeat lytes in PM.
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Mild yesterday, slightly worsened today.  Unclear
   etiology, possibly due to ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would get ultrasound.
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - Was on vanc/zosyn/cipro/ceftriaxone and antibiotics chief (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   thought that coverage with ceftriaxone and zosyn not necessary unless
   there is very high suspicion for pseudomonas.  zosyn d/c'ed.
   - was agitated several times.  Got 2mg haldol shortly before 4pm.
   Shortly afterwards he desaturated to the 70s, was bag masked for
   several minutes and a mucus plug was aspirated with improvement in his
   sats.  He then stabilized and was bronched.
   - Started on cefepime because of instability.  Need to contact ID to
   ask whether ceftriaxone can be stopped while cefepime is being given
   (equivalent Lyme coverage?).
   - Agitated again at midnight, given further 2mg of haldol.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of Lyme encephalitis, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. He has a history of hypertension, ITP, and chronic pain management.

The patient's 24-hour events are significant for bronchoscopy, which revealed a mucus plug that was aspirated with improvement in oxygen saturation. He was started on cefepime due to instability, and his antibiotics were adjusted accordingly. The patient was also agitated multiple times, requiring further doses of haldol.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, and blood pressure of 139/58 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 99%, and he is on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate dehydrogenase. His liver function tests are mildly elevated, and his electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging studies show bilateral basal infiltrates on chest X-ray, which may explain his increasing fevers. His respiratory viral screen is pending, and his bronchial washings are awaiting results.

The patient's assessment and plan include impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, as well as impaired muscle performance, respiration, and elimination. He has a diagnosis of respiratory failure, acute, not ARDS, and Lyme disease. His altered mental status is attributed to encephalitis, although it may be multifactorial.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, requiring further interventions such as mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever may indicate sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Neurological deficits: The patient's Lyme encephalitis may result in permanent neurological deficits, including cognitive impairment, memory loss, and motor dysfunction.
4. Infection: The patient's respiratory viral screen is pending, and his bronchial washings are awaiting results. If an infection is detected, it may require additional antibiotics or antiviral therapy.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated, which may require further management to prevent complications such as seizures or cardiovascular instability.
6. Corneal ulcer: The patient's corneal ulcer may require further treatment and follow-up with ophthalmology to prevent complications such as vision loss.
7. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, which may require further investigation to determine the cause and prevent liver damage.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications. His care plan should include frequent assessments of his respiratory, neurological, and metabolic status, as well as adjustments to his antibiotics, sedation, and ventilation as needed."

   - Zosyn d/c'ed.
   - was agitated several times.  Got 2mg haldol shortly before 4pm.
   Shortly afterwards he desaturated to the 70s, was bag masked for
   several minutes and a mucus plug was aspirated with improvement in his
   sats.  He then stabilized and was bronched.
   - Started on cefepime because of instability, to cover for
   pseudomonas.  Need to contact ID to ask whether ceftriaxone can be
   stopped while cefepime is being given (equivalent Lyme coverage?).
   - Agitated again at midnight, given further 2mg of haldol.

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   70s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, zosyn and cipro for a
   presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed possible
   new RLL infiltrates).  The hypotension also happened soon after
   receiving several medications, and was repeated this morning after
   receiving metoprolol, clonidine, methadone and seroquel. Unclear that
   this hypotension represents a brewing sepsis. Afebrile since [**2102-9-16**]
   at 7am.
   - BP
s currently look good but if continued hypotension consider DC
   Clonidine or Metoprolol
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm that would not likely respond to
   metoprolol, but his metoprolol was still increased to 75mg TID, but
   then backed down to 25mg TID.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - F/u with ID about whether he should be on Ceftriaxone and Cefipime
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 24 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Will contact pharmacy about how to wean safely.
   - Seroquel 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for agitation.
   - Can also give Haldol 2mg prn agitation.
   - Given that nutritional deficits appear very unlikely, IV thiamine,
   folate and multivitamin have been d/c'd.
   # Respiratory failure.  Now doing well on trach mask. Seems to desat
   with plugging/secretions at times.  Atelectasis on imaging.
   - f/u CXR read.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - will do trach mask trail today
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-14**] at 7am. Was only on Ceftraxone, but several more
   [**Year (2 digits) **]
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All recent
   cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA
   but this has been present for several previous CXR
s and the pt is
   being covered with very broad spectrum [**Year (2 digits) **]. Recent PICC has been pulled
   and cath tip is negative. No clear infectious source other than the IgM
   Lyme for which he is almost done with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   - Continue broad spectrums as above but will need to start thinking
   about peeling some back if there is no clear source. However, pt has
   been afebrile since broad spectrums were started, so could argue that
   he needs to continue them.
   - If he continues to need these [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] need PICC placed
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.
   # H/o Hypernatremia. Not active currently but needs to be watched and
   given free H20 flushes if Na increases again. Will d/c current free H20
   flushes now.
   FEN: correct/replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, H2B
   Access: Peripherals. As he has now been afebrile greater than 48hrs,
   will place PICC for [**First Name3 (LF) **] and other med needs as he will likely need
   [**Location (un) **] care for quite a while, either at [**Hospital1 1**] or rehab

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   70s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, zosyn and cipro for a
   presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed possible
   new RLL infiltrates).  The hypotension also happened soon after
   receiving several medications, and was repeated this morning after
   receiving metoprolol, clonidine, methadone and seroquel. Unclear that
   this hypotension represents a brewing sepsis. Afebrile since [**2102-9-16**]
   at 7am.
   - BP
s currently look good but if continued hypotension consider DC
   Clonidine or Metoprolol
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm that would not likely respond to
   metoprolol, but his metoprolol was still increased to 75mg TID, but
   then backed down to 25mg TID.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - F/u with ID about whether he should be on Ceftriaxone and Cefipime
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 24 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Will contact pharmacy about how to wean safely.
   - Seroquel 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for agitation.
   - Can also give Haldol 2mg prn agitation.
   - Given that nutritional deficits appear very unlikely, IV thiamine,
   folate and multivitamin have been d/c'd.
   # Respiratory failure.  Now doing well on trach mask. Seems to desat
   with plugging/secretions at times.  Atelectasis on imaging.
   - f/u CXR read.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - will do trach mask trail today
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-14**] at 7am. Was only on Ceftraxone, but several more
   [**Year (2 digits) **]
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All recent
   cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA
   but this has been present for several previous CXR
s and the pt is
   being covered with very broad spectrum [**Year (2 digits) **]. Recent PICC has been pulled
   and cath tip is negative. No clear infectious source other than the IgM
   Lyme for which he is almost done with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   - Continue broad spectrums as above but will need to start thinking
   about peeling some back if there is no clear source. However, pt has
   been afebrile since broad spectrums were started, so could argue that
   he needs to continue them.
   - If he continues to need these [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] need PICC placed
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.
   # H/o Hypernatremia. Not active currently but needs to be watched and
   given free H20 flushes if Na increases again. Will d/c current free H20
   flushes now.
   FEN: correct/replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, H2B
   Access: Peripherals. As he has now been afebrile greater than 48hrs,
   will place PICC for [**First Name3 (LF) **] and other med needs as he will likely need
   [**Location (un) **] care for quite a while, either at [**Hospital1 1**] or rehab

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, ITP, and admitted with neurologic changes and diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis. He has been treated with a 28-day course of ceftriaxone and is currently on day 24.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 37.4°C, Heart rate 91 bpm, Blood pressure 139/58 mmHg, Respiratory rate 10 inspirations per minute, Oxygen saturation 99%.
* Respiratory support: Tracheostomy tube, CPAP/PSV ventilation, FiO2 50%.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete Blood Count (CBC): White blood cell count 12.1, Hemoglobin 9.9 g/dL, Platelet count 328 K/uL.
	+ Electrolyte levels: Sodium 140 mEq/L, Potassium 4.2 mEq/L, Chloride 103 mEq/L, Bicarbonate 28.9%.
	+ Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine: 15 mg/dL and 0.5 mg/dL, respectively.
	+ Liver function tests (LFTs): Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 44, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 30, Alkaline phosphatase (ALK) 105, Total bilirubin 0.3.
	+ Coagulation studies: International normalized ratio (INR) 1.1, Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 26.4 seconds.
* Imaging studies:
	+ Chest X-ray (CXR): Bilateral basal infiltrates, more on the left than right, which could explain the patient's increasing fevers.
	+ Computed Tomography (CT) scan: Not available.
* Microbiology results:
	+ Respiratory viral culture (RVC): Pending.
	+ Blood cultures: Negative to date.
	+ BAL and bronchial washings: Pending.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, which could be a sign of sepsis. However, the cultures have been negative to date, and the patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation and has a history of respiratory failure. The CXR shows bilateral basal infiltrates, which could indicate pneumonia or atelectasis.
3. Neurologic deficits: The patient has a history of Lyme encephalitis and has been treated with ceftriaxone. However, he still has neurologic deficits, and it is unclear if they are permanent.
4. Electrolyte abnormalities: The patient has had electrolyte abnormalities, including hypernatremia, which needs to be monitored and managed.
5. Liver function tests (LFTs): The patient's LFTs are abnormal, and it is unclear if this is due to the ceftriaxone or another underlying condition.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged PTT, which could indicate a coagulopathy.
7. Infection: The patient has a history of infection, including Lyme disease, and is at risk for developing another infection while in the ICU.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is at risk for developing nutritional deficiencies due to his respiratory failure and inability to eat.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is recommended that he continue to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics and be monitored closely for signs of sepsis, respiratory failure, and neurologic deficits. Additionally, the patient's electrolyte levels should be monitored and managed, and his LFTs should be trended to ensure that they are not worsening."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and there is a risk of further decline or complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and impaired cognition may worsen, leading to increased risk of delirium, agitation, or other neurological complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is normotensive, but there is a risk of further decline or hypotensive episodes, particularly if the patient's condition deteriorates.
4. Constipation: The patient's altered elimination patterns and constipation may worsen, leading to further complications such as bowel obstruction or pressure ulcers.
5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of developing secondary infections, such as sepsis or pneumonia.
6. Neurological sequelae: The patient's Lyme encephalitis may lead to long-term neurological sequelae, such as cognitive impairment, memory loss, or motor dysfunction.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's underlying cardiovascular disease and hypotension increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's compromised gut function and prolonged fasting may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Skin breakdown: The patient's prolonged immobility and compromised circulation increase the risk of skin breakdown, pressure ulcers, or decubitus ulcers.
10. Medication-related complications: The patient's complex medication regimen and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of medication-related complications, such as adverse reactions, interactions, or overdoses.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to mitigate these risks and improve the patient's outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with Lyme encephalitis, respiratory failure, and delirium. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which may lead to ventilator-associated complications such as ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy is likely a result of Lyme encephalitis, which can cause altered mental status, confusion, and disorientation. The patient's delirium may be contributing to his respiratory failure by increasing his respiratory drive and making it more difficult to manage his ventilator.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be a result of his encephalopathy, respiratory failure, or other underlying conditions.
4. Fever: The patient's fever has been controlled with antibiotics, but he may still be at risk for developing sepsis or other infections.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's heart rhythm is abnormal, and he may be at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiovascular complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient may develop further respiratory failure, including VILI, VAP, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy may worsen, leading to increased delirium, confusion, and disorientation.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen, leading to decreased perfusion of vital organs and increased risk of organ failure.
4. Fever: The patient may develop sepsis or other infections, which can further complicate his condition.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient may develop cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiovascular complications, which can worsen his overall condition.

To address these potential complications, the patient's care team should:

1. Monitor his respiratory status closely and adjust his ventilator settings as needed to prevent VILI and VAP.
2. Continue to manage his encephalopathy with antibiotics and other medications as needed to prevent worsening of his condition.
3. Monitor his blood pressure and cardiovascular status closely and adjust his medications as needed to prevent hypotension and cardiovascular complications.
4. Continue to monitor his fever and adjust his antibiotics and other medications as needed to prevent sepsis and other infections.
5. Consider consulting with a specialist, such as a neurologist or cardiologist, to help manage the patient's encephalopathy and cardiovascular instability.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 70-inch tall, 80.6 kg individual who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS). The patient has a history of Lyme disease and altered mental status (not delirium). The patient is currently receiving methadone taper, and a PICC is recommended. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 99/62 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, CPAP/PSV ventilator mode, and FiO2 of 50%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and elevated lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress to chronic respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels may indicate sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure.
3. Constipation: The patient's altered elimination related to constipation may lead to further complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium, which can lead to increased risk of falls, pressure ulcers, and other complications.
5. Wound infection: The patient's tracheostomy tube may be at risk for infection, which can lead to further complications, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
6. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's prophylaxis for DVT may not be sufficient, and the patient may be at risk for venous thromboembolism.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis may not be sufficient, and the patient may be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Catheter-associated urinary tract infection: The patient's urinary catheter may be at risk for infection, which can lead to further complications, such as sepsis or kidney damage."

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  The hypotension also happened soon
   after receiving several medications, and was repeated yesterday morning
   after receiving metoprolol, clonidine, methadone and seroquel. Unclear
   that this hypotension represents a brewing sepsis. Afebrile since
   [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Will try stopping some antihypertensives and see if
   this improves. D/c clonodine given that he is on metoprolol for control
   of HR after an accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   - Taper clonodine
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days, then 0.1 mg daily x3 days, then
   off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm that would not likely respond to
   metoprolol, but his metoprolol was still increased to 75mg TID, but
   then backed down to 25mg TID.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 25 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Also increase seroquel given that he has had
   periods where he appears more normal and then periods where he appears
   more confused (waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]).
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Will contact pharmacy about how to wean safely.
   - Seroquel 25 mg TID for agitation.
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient on trache mask yesterday, had an
   episode of desaturation so placed back on vent.  Per notes seems to
   have been related to secretions. CXR today does appear improved, making
   PNA less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several
   more ABx
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. PT was
   started on cefepime, vanco and cipro, but in the setting of negative
   cultures will plan to d/c these antibiotics. Also trying to minimize
   medications in the setting of confusion and agitation. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

**Patient Information:**

* Patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, ITP, and admitted with neurologic changes and found to have Lyme encephalitis.
* Current medications include methadone, seroquel, and metoprolol.
* Patient has a tracheostomy tube and is on mechanical ventilation.
* Patient has a PICC line in place.

**24-Hour Events:**

* Started methadone taper as per doctor's recommendation.
* Needs a PICC line.
* ID recommended ceftriaxone rather than cefipime.
* Trach mask trial failed due to patient's desaturation and thick yellow secretions.
* Stop ISS and free H2O flushes.
* Team meeting scheduled for October 13th at 4 pm.

**Lab Results:**

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 17.5, Hct 36.1, Plt 448, Cr 0.6, TCO2 36, Glucose 142.
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR 13.0/26.4/1.1, CK / CKMB / Troponin-T 62/<0.01, ALT / AST 40/23, Alk Phos / T Bili 103/0.3, Amylase / Lipase 74/21, Differential-Neuts 76.9%, Band 0.0%, Lymph 12.7%, Mono 8.5%, Eos 1.7%, Lactic Acid 0.7 mmol/L, Albumin 2.5 g/dL, LDH 172 IU/L, Ca++ 8.3 mg/dL, Mg++ 2.6 mg/dL, PO4 4.2 mg/dL.

**Assessment and Plan:**

* Arousal, attention, and cognition impaired.
* Balance, muscle performance, and respiration impaired.
* Altered mental status (not delirium).
* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS).
* Lyme disease.
* Hypotension: Patient has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to 80s. Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime, and cipro for a presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia.
* Fever: Daily low-grade temps (100-100.3), but has been afebrile since October 16th at 4 pm.
* Corneal ulcer: s/p eyelid suturing with ophthalmology.
* Elevated LFTs: Improving, but unclear etiology, possibly due to ceftriaxone.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Sepsis: Patient has been having periods of hypotension, which could be a sign of sepsis.
* Respiratory failure: Patient is on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube, which increases the risk of respiratory failure.
* Neurological deficits: Patient has Lyme encephalitis, which could lead to permanent neurological deficits.
* Infection: Patient has been on antibiotics for a presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia, but recent cultures have been negative.
* Constipation: Patient has a history of chronic narcotic use, which could lead to constipation.
* Electrolyte abnormalities: Patient has elevated LFTs, which could be due to ceftriaxone or other medications.
* Medication-related complications: Patient is on multiple medications, which could interact with each other and cause adverse effects.

**Recommendations:**

* Continue to monitor patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
* Continue to provide respiratory support and wean patient off mechanical ventilation as tolerated.
* Continue to monitor patient's neurological status and address any neurological deficits.
* Continue to provide antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease.
* Continue to monitor patient's electrolyte levels and address any abnormalities.
* Consider stopping some antihypertensives and weaning patient off methadone.
* Continue to provide patient education and support to patient and family."

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, zosyn and cipro for a
   presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed possible
   new RLL infiltrates).  The hypotension also happened soon after
   receiving several medications, and was repeated this morning after
   receiving metoprolol, clonidine, methadone and seroquel. Unclear that
   this hypotension represents a brewing sepsis. Afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at
   4pm.
   - BP
s currently look good but if continued hypotension consider DC
   Clonidine or Metoprolol
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm that would not likely respond to
   metoprolol, but his metoprolol was still increased to 75mg TID, but
   then backed down to 25mg TID.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - F/u with ID about whether he should be on Ceftriaxone and Cefipime
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 24 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Will contact pharmacy about how to wean safely.
   - Seroquel 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for agitation.
   - Can also give Haldol 2mg prn agitation.
   - Given that nutritional deficits appear very unlikely, IV thiamine,
   folate and multivitamin have been d/c'd.
   # Respiratory failure.  Now doing well on trach mask. Seems to desat
   with plugging/secretions at times.  Atelectasis on imaging.
   - f/u CXR read.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - will do trach mask trail today
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-14**] at 7am. Was only on Ceftraxone, but several more
   [**Year (2 digits) **]
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All recent
   cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA
   but this has been present for several previous CXR
s and the pt is
   being covered with very broad spectrum [**Year (2 digits) **]. Recent PICC has been pulled
   and cath tip is negative. No clear infectious source other than the IgM
   Lyme for which he is almost done with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   - Continue broad spectrums as above but will need to start thinking
   about peeling some back if there is no clear source. However, pt has
   been afebrile since broad spectrums were started, so could argue that
   he needs to continue them.
   - If he continues to need these [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] need PICC placed
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.
   # H/o Hypernatremia. Not active currently but needs to be watched and
   given free H20 flushes if Na increases again. Will d/c current free H20
   flushes now.
   FEN: correct/replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, H2B
   Access: Peripherals. As he has now been afebrile greater than 48hrs,
   will place PICC for [**First Name3 (LF) **] and other med needs as he will likely need
   [**Location (un) **] care for quite a while, either at [**Hospital1 1**] or rehab

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Clonidine or Metoprolol
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm that would not likely respond to
   metoprolol, but his metoprolol was still increased to 75mg TID, but
   then backed down to 25mg TID.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - F/u with ID about whether he should be on Ceftriaxone and Cefipime
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 24 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Will contact pharmacy about how to wean safely.
   - Seroquel 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for agitation.
   - Can also give Haldol 2mg prn agitation.
   - Given that nutritional deficits appear very unlikely, IV thiamine,
   folate and multivitamin have been d/c'd.
   # Respiratory failure.  Now doing well on trach mask. Seems to desat
   with plugging/secretions at times.  Atelectasis on imaging.
   - f/u CXR read.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - will do trach mask trail today
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-14**] at 7am. Was only on Ceftraxone, but several more
   [**Year (2 digits) **]
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All recent
   cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA
   but this has been present for several previous CXR
s and the pt is
   being covered with very broad spectrum [**Year (2 digits) **]. Recent PICC has been pulled
   and cath tip is negative. No clear infectious source other than the IgM
   Lyme for which he is almost done with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   - Continue broad spectrums as above but will need to start thinking
   about peeling some back if there is no clear source. However, pt has
   been afebrile since broad spectrums were started, so could argue that
   he needs to continue them.
   - If he continues to need these [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] need PICC placed
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.
   # H/o Hypernatremia. Not active currently but needs to be watched and
   given free H20 flushes if Na increases again. Will d/c current free H20
   flushes now.
   FEN: correct/replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, H2B
   Access: Peripherals. As he has now been afebrile greater than 48hrs,
   will place PICC for [**First Name3 (LF) **] and other med needs as he will likely need
   [**Location (un) **] care for quite a while, either at [**Hospital1 1**] or rehab

   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental

   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  The hypotension also happened soon
   after receiving several medications, and was repeated yesterday morning
   after receiving metoprolol, clonidine, methadone and seroquel. Unclear
   that this hypotension represents a brewing sepsis. Afebrile since
   [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm.
   - D/c clonodine and monitor response
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm that would not likely respond to
   metoprolol, but his metoprolol was still increased to 75mg TID, but
   then backed down to 25mg TID.

   - Seroquel 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for agitation.
   - Psychiatry consult today
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient on trache mask yesterday, had an
   episode of desaturation so placed back on vent.  Per notes seems to
   have been related to secretions. On antibiotics for possible pneumonia.
   -Repeat CXR
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  The hypotension also happened soon
   after receiving several medications, and was repeated yesterday morning
   after receiving metoprolol, clonidine, methadone and seroquel. Unclear
   that this hypotension represents a brewing sepsis. Afebrile since
   [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm.
   - D/c clonodine and monitor response
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm that would not likely respond to
   metoprolol, but his metoprolol was still increased to 75mg TID, but
   then backed down to 25mg TID.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 25 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Will contact pharmacy about how to wean safely.
   - Seroquel 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for agitation.
   - Psychiatry consult today
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient on trache mask yesterday, had an
   episode of desaturation so placed back on vent.  Per notes seems to
   have been related to secretions. On antibiotics for possible pneumonia.
   -Repeat CXR
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftraxone, but several more
   [**Year (2 digits) **]
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All recent
   cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA
   but this has been present for several previous CXR
s and the pt is
   being covered with very broad spectrum [**Year (2 digits) **]. Recent PICC has been pulled
   and cath tip is negative. No clear infectious source other than the IgM
   Lyme for which he is almost done with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   - Continue Vancomycin, Cipro, Cefepime.
   - If he continues to need these [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] need PICC placed
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.
   FEN: correct/replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2B
   Access: Peripherals. As he has now been afebrile greater than 48hrs,
   will place PICC for [**First Name3 (LF) **] and other med needs as he will likely need
   [**Location (un) **] care for quite a while, either at [**Hospital1 1**] or rehab

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient, a 63-year-old male, is a transfer from another hospital with a diagnosis of Lyme encephalitis. He has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, altered mental status, and hypotension. The patient has a history of hypertension, ITP, and chronic pain, for which he has been taking methadone.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 84 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 99/62 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy through a tracheostomy tube and is on a ventilator in CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's lab results show mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes, which are improving. His white blood cell count is normal, and his electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's medical issues include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on a ventilator due to respiratory failure, and his CXR shows bilateral base opacification that could reflect atelectasis or supervening pneumonia.
2. Altered mental status: The patient has impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, and his mental status is altered due to encephalitis, electrolyte abnormalities, and possible concurrent infections.
3. Hypotension: The patient has had periods of hypotension, which responded to IV fluids and antibiotics. The cause of the hypotension is unclear, and it is being monitored.
4. Fever: The patient's fever has been low-grade and has been afebrile since October 16. He is receiving antibiotics for a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia.
5. Corneal ulcer: The patient has a corneal ulcer that is being treated with topical antibiotics and ophthalmology follow-up.
6. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, but the cause is unclear. They are being monitored and trending downward.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Weaning from the ventilator as tolerated.
2. Continuing antibiotics for possible pneumonia.
3. Monitoring for signs of sepsis.
4. Reorienting the patient frequently to avoid chemical sedation and restraints.
5. Trying to wean the patient off methadone.
6. Continuing inhaled medications for bronchospasm.
7. Placing a PICC line for future medication needs.
8. Monitoring the patient's electrolyte levels and liver enzymes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his respiratory failure, altered mental status, and hypotension.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for pneumonia due to his respiratory failure and antibiotic use.
3. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient is at risk for electrolyte imbalances due to his altered mental status and medication use.
4. Liver damage: The patient is at risk for liver damage due to his elevated liver enzymes and antibiotic use.
5. Corneal ulcers: The patient is at risk for corneal ulcers due to his altered mental status and inability to protect his eyes.
6. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm: The patient is at risk for an accelerated idioventricular rhythm due to his antibiotic use and cardiac history.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these potential complications and ensure his recovery."

   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  The hypotension also happened soon
   after receiving several medications, and was repeated yesterday morning
   after receiving metoprolol, clonidine, methadone and seroquel. Unclear
   that this hypotension represents a brewing sepsis. Afebrile since
   [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Will try stopping some antihypertensives and see if
   this improves. D/c clonodine given that he is on metoprolol for control
   of HR after an accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   - Taper clonodine
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days, then 0.1 mg daily x3 days, then
   off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm that would not likely respond to
   metoprolol, but his metoprolol was still increased to 75mg TID, but
   then backed down to 25mg TID.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 25 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Also increase seroquel given that he has had
   periods where he appears more normal and then periods where he appears
   more confused (waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]).
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Will contact pharmacy about how to wean safely.
   - Seroquel 25 mg TID for agitation.
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient on trache mask yesterday, had an
   episode of desaturation so placed back on vent.  Per notes seems to
   have been related to secretions. CXR today does appear improved, making
   PNA less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several
   more ABx
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. PT was
   started on cefepime, vanco and cipro, but in the setting of negative
   cultures will plan to d/c these antibiotics. Also trying to minimize
   medications in the setting of confusion and agitation. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male admitted with neurologic changes and diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis. He has been experiencing various complications, including:

1. Hypotension: The patient has had several episodes of hypotension, which may be related to sepsis or medication side effects. The plan is to stop some antihypertensives and monitor for improvement.
2. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing confusion, agitation, and altered mental status, which may be related to encephalitis, electrolyte abnormalities, or medication side effects. The plan is to minimize medications and reorient the patient frequently.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has been on a ventilator due to respiratory failure, which may be related to secretions or atelectasis. The plan is to continue weaning the patient off the ventilator as tolerated.
4. Fever: The patient has had daily low-grade temperatures, but has been afebrile since October 16th. The plan is to discontinue antibiotics and monitor for any signs of infection.
5. Corneal ulcer: The patient has a corneal ulcer, which may be related to his neurologic deficits. The plan is to continue treatment with vigamox and bacitracin ointment, and follow up with ophthalmology.
6. Elevated LFTs: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, but are improving. The etiology is unclear, but may be related to ceftriaxone.
7. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm: The patient has an accelerated idioventricular rhythm, which was seen by cardiology and is considered benign.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and fever may indicate sepsis, which could lead to organ failure and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if not managed properly, leading to hypoxia and acidosis.
3. Neurologic deficits: The patient's neurologic deficits may worsen if not managed properly, leading to long-term disability or death.
4. Infection: The patient's corneal ulcer and elevated LFTs may indicate an underlying infection, which could spread and cause further complications.
5. Medication side effects: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory failure may be related to medication side effects, which could worsen if not managed properly.

To mitigate these risks, the patient's care team should:

1. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to detect any signs of sepsis or infection.
2. Continue to wean the patient off the ventilator and monitor for respiratory failure.
3. Manage the patient's neurologic deficits with frequent reorientation and minimize medications.
4. Continue treatment for the corneal ulcer and follow up with ophthalmology.
5. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and adjust treatment accordingly.
6. Adjust the patient's medication regimen to minimize side effects and optimize treatment."

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  The hypotension also happened soon
   after receiving several medications, and was repeated yesterday morning
   after receiving metoprolol, clonidine, methadone and seroquel. Unclear
   that this hypotension represents a brewing sepsis. Afebrile since
   [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm.
   - D/c clonodine and monitor response
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days, then 0.1 mg daily x3 days, then
   off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm that would not likely respond to
   metoprolol, but his metoprolol was still increased to 75mg TID, but
   then backed down to 25mg TID.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 25 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Will contact pharmacy about how to wean safely.
   - Seroquel 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for agitation.
   - Psychiatry consult today
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient on trache mask yesterday, had an
   episode of desaturation so placed back on vent.  Per notes seems to
   have been related to secretions. On antibiotics for possible pneumonia.
   -Repeat CXR
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftraxone, but several more
   [**Year (2 digits) **]
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All recent
   cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA
   but this has been present for several previous CXR
s and the pt is
   being covered with very broad spectrum [**Year (2 digits) **]. Recent PICC has been pulled
   and cath tip is negative. No clear infectious source other than the IgM
   Lyme for which he is almost done with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   - Continue Vancomycin, Cipro, Cefepime.
   - If he continues to need these [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] need PICC placed
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.
   FEN: correct/replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2B
   Access: Peripherals. As he has now been afebrile greater than 48hrs,
   will place PICC for [**First Name3 (LF) **] and other med needs as he will likely need
   [**Location (un) **] care for quite a while, either at [**Hospital1 1**] or rehab

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  The hypotension also happened soon
   after receiving several medications, and was repeated yesterday morning
   after receiving metoprolol, clonidine, methadone and seroquel. Unclear
   that this hypotension represents a brewing sepsis. Afebrile since
   [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm.
   - D/c clonodine and monitor response
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days, then 0.1 mg daily x3 days, then
   off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm that would not likely respond to
   metoprolol, but his metoprolol was still increased to 75mg TID, but
   then backed down to 25mg TID.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 25 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted with neurologic changes and diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis. He has been experiencing altered mental status, fever, and respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. He has also been treated for presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia with antibiotics. His laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, electrolyte abnormalities, and a positive Lyme serology. He has been on a 28-day course of ceftriaxone for Lyme disease, and his neurology is being followed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotensive episodes and fever could be indicative of sepsis, particularly given the presence of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and bilateral base opacification on CXR could be indicative of pneumonia, which is being treated with antibiotics.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show electrolyte abnormalities, which could exacerbate his altered mental status and respiratory failure.
4. Liver Enzyme Elevations: The patient's elevated liver enzymes could be indicative of liver damage or dysfunction, which could worsen his overall condition.
5. Neurological Deficits: The patient's persistent neurological deficits could be indicative of permanent damage from Lyme encephalitis, which could impact his quality of life.
6. Constipation: The patient's alteration in elimination related to constipation could lead to further complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
7. Infection: The patient's continued use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and his history of Lyme disease could increase the risk of developing antibiotic-resistant infections.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's altered mental status, fever, and respiratory failure require continued close monitoring and management. The patient's antibiotics should be continued, and his electrolyte levels should be closely monitored and corrected as necessary. The patient's liver enzyme elevations should be trended, and if they continue to rise, further evaluation and management should be considered. The patient's neurological deficits should be followed by neurology, and the patient should be counseled on the potential for permanent damage. The patient's constipation should be managed with laxatives and stool softeners, and the patient should be educated on the importance of regular bowel movements."

   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 26 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Also increase seroquel given that he has had
   periods where he appears more normal and then periods where he appears
   more confused (waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]).
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Will contact pharmacy about how to wean safely.
   - Seroquel 25 mg TID for agitation.
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  Patient has periods
   of apnea when sleeping. Trache mask trial today.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm
   - Taper clonodine
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days (today is day #2), then 0.1 mg
   daily x3 days, then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 26 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Also increase seroquel given that he has had
   periods where he appears more normal and then periods where he appears
   more confused (waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]).
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Will contact pharmacy about how to wean safely.
   - Seroquel 25 mg TID for agitation.
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  Patient has periods
   of apnea when sleeping. Trache mask trial today.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm
   - Taper clonodine
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days (today is day #2), then 0.1 mg
   daily x3 days, then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several
   more ABx
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. PT was
   started on cefepime, vanco and cipro, but in the setting of negative
   cultures will plan to d/c these antibiotics. Also trying to minimize
   medications in the setting of confusion and agitation. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male admitted with neurologic changes and diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis. The patient has been treated with ceftriaxone for 26 days out of a planned 28-day course. The patient's condition is complex, with multiple potential medical complications.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, and weaning from the ventilator is being attempted. Pneumonia is a possibility, but sputum cultures have been negative.
2. Hypotension: The patient has had periods of hypotension, and antihypertensives may need to be adjusted or discontinued.
3. Fever: The patient has had daily low-grade temperatures, but has been afebrile since October 16th. Antibiotics were added due to transient hypotensive episodes, but recent cultures have been negative.
4. Confusion and agitation: The patient's altered mental status is primarily due to encephalitis, but may also be related to electrolyte abnormalities, concurrent infection, or medication side effects.
5. Corneal ulcer: The patient has a corneal ulcer, likely related to neurologic deficits and inability to protect the eye.
6. Elevated LFTs: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, but the etiology is unclear and may be related to ceftriaxone.
7. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm: The patient has an accelerated idioventricular rhythm, which is thought to be benign and not related to Lyme disease.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Weaning from the ventilator as tolerated.
2. Continuing inhaled medications for bronchospasm.
3. Tapering clonodine and discontinuing metoprolol as tolerated.
4. Monitoring for signs of infection, including fever, hypotension, and changes in mental status.
5. Reassessing the patient's electrolyte status and correcting any abnormalities.
6. Continuing ceftriaxone for Lyme disease, with plans to discontinue antibiotics if cultures remain negative.
7. Monitoring the patient's corneal ulcer and providing ophthalmology follow-up as needed.
8. Continuing to trend the patient's liver function tests and addressing any abnormalities.

The patient's family has been educated on the plan of care and has been advised to visit some long-term acute rehabilitation facilities in the near future."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted with neurologic changes and diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis. He has been treated with ceftriaxone for 26 days and is expected to complete a 28-day course. The patient's current status is:

* Altered mental status, primarily due to encephalitis, with periods of agitation and confusion
* Respiratory failure, with a CXR showing improved lung function, making pneumonia less likely
* Metabolic alkalosis, with bicarbonate trending up
* Hypotension, with SBPs in the 80s, responding to IV fluids and antibiotics
* Fever, which has been low-grade and afebrile since October 16th
* Corneal ulcer, likely related to neurologic deficits
* Elevated LFTs, improving but unclear etiology
* Accelerated idioventricular rhythm, thought to be benign and not related to Lyme disease

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: Continued weaning from the ventilator and monitoring for signs of respiratory distress.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: Further evaluation with urine chloride and bicarbonate levels to assess for volume depletion.
3. Hypotension: Monitoring for signs of hypovolemia and adjusting fluid management accordingly.
4. Fever: Continued monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as necessary.
5. Corneal ulcer: Ongoing treatment with vigamox and bacitracin ointment, with follow-up with ophthalmology as recommended.
6. Elevated LFTs: Continued monitoring for signs of liver dysfunction and adjusting medication therapy as necessary.
7. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm: Continued monitoring for signs of cardiac arrhythmia and adjusting medication therapy as necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy accordingly.
2. Further evaluate the patient's metabolic alkalosis and adjust fluid management as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust therapy accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's temperature and adjust antibiotic therapy as necessary.
5. Continue treatment for the corneal ulcer and follow-up with ophthalmology as recommended.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and adjust medication therapy as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust medication therapy as necessary."

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 26 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Also increase seroquel given that he has had
   periods where he appears more normal and then periods where he appears
   more confused (waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]).
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Will contact pharmacy about how to wean safely.
   - Seroquel 25 mg TID for agitation.
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm
   - Taper clonodine
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days (today is day #2), then 0.1 mg
   daily x3 days, then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient on trache mask yesterday, had an
   episode of desaturation so placed back on vent.  Per notes seems to
   have been related to secretions. CXR today does appear improved, making
   PNA less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several
   more ABx
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. PT was
   started on cefepime, vanco and cipro, but in the setting of negative
   cultures will plan to d/c these antibiotics. Also trying to minimize
   medications in the setting of confusion and agitation. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 PICC LINE - START [**2102-10-20**] 01:24 PM
   - f/u XRay for PICC: in low SVC. Small R pleural effusion decreased but
   R lung base remains elevated and atelectatic. Atelectasis of L base has
   improved
   - Clonidine taper: 0.1mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days, then 0.1mg daily x3days, then OFF
   - Cdiff negative
   - Off ABx except Ceftriaxone for the Lyme and watch to see if he
   re-spikes or WBC's increase...if there is an infxn let it declare
   itself
   - Quiet after Quietiapine
   - Family mtg today: goals are wean from the ventilator, improve mental
   status by streamlining medications and to continue to search for any
   sources and signs of infection.  Long Term Acute Rehab was discussed as
   the most likely next destination and the family is planning on visiting
   some facilities in the near future.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male admitted with neurologic changes and diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis. He has been treated with ceftriaxone for 26 days out of a planned 28-day course.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, with a tidal volume set at 400 mL and a peak inspiratory pressure of 14 cmH2O.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is 143/89 mmHg, with a heart rate of 83 bpm. He has a history of hypertension and is currently on metoprolol for control of heart rate.
* Neurological: The patient has impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, and is experiencing altered mental status. He has responded well to PRN haldol, but will try to avoid chemical sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has constipation and is at risk for electrolyte abnormalities.
* Infections: The patient has a history of Lyme disease and is currently being treated with ceftriaxone. He has had several negative cultures, and it is planned to discontinue antibiotics.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 17.5 K/uL, and his hemoglobin is 10.4 g/dL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of further respiratory failure if the underlying cause is not addressed.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, and he has a history of hypertension. There is a risk of further cardiovascular instability if his blood pressure is not controlled.
* Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status is impaired, and there is a risk of further deterioration if his condition is not managed appropriately.
* Infection: The patient has a history of Lyme disease and is currently being treated with antibiotics. There is a risk of further infection if the underlying cause is not addressed.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has constipation and is at risk for electrolyte abnormalities. There is a risk of further gastrointestinal complications if his condition is not managed appropriately.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

* Continue mechanical ventilation as tolerated, with a goal of weaning the patient off the ventilator as soon as possible.
* Continue to manage the patient's blood pressure and cardiovascular status with metoprolol and other medications as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and manage his altered mental status with PRN haldol and other medications as necessary.
* Continue to manage the patient's constipation with laxatives and other medications as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and manage any abnormalities that arise.
* Continue to monitor the patient's white blood cell count and manage any abnormalities that arise.
* Continue to monitor the patient's hemoglobin level and manage any abnormalities that arise.
* Continue to monitor the patient's temperature and manage any abnormalities that arise.
* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and manage any abnormalities that arise.
* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and manage any abnormalities that arise.
* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and manage any abnormalities that arise.
* Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and manage any abnormalities that arise.
* Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and manage any abnormalities that arise.

   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 26 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Also increase seroquel given that he has had
   periods where he appears more normal and then periods where he appears
   more confused (waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]).
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Will contact pharmacy about how to wean safely.
   - Seroquel 25 mg TID for agitation
 increase to 50 mg TID.
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  Patient has periods
   of apnea when sleeping. Trache mask trial today.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb has been trending up. [**Month (only) 11**] be affecting
   respiratory drive as patient has been having apneaic episodes. Will
   check urine chloride to assess if possibly volume depleted.

   -Urine chloride
   -Will give diamox
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted with neurologic changes and suspected Lyme encephalitis. He has been treated with ceftriaxone for 26 days out of a planned 28-day course. He remains altered mentally, with periods of agitation and confusion. His respiratory status has improved, but he still requires ventilator support. He has a history of chronic pain and has been on methadone, which is being weaned. He has also been on clonidine, which is being tapered.

The patient has a PICC line in place and has had a small right pleural effusion, which has decreased but the right lung base remains elevated and atelectatic. He has also had a mild atelectasis at the left base, which has improved.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated WBC count, but all cultures have been negative. His liver function tests (LFTs) are improving, but the etiology is unclear. His electrolytes are being monitored, and he is receiving prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he still requires ventilator support. He may experience respiratory failure if his lung function worsens.
2. Infection: The patient's cultures have been negative, but he is still at risk for infection, particularly with his altered mental status and respiratory compromise.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status is a concern, and he may experience delirium if not managed properly.
4. Constipation: The patient's electrolyte abnormalities and medication regimen may increase his risk for constipation.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's CXR shows bilateral base opacification, atelectasis, and possible new right lower lobe infiltrates, which may indicate pneumonia.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of accelerated idioventricular rhythm, which may recur if not managed properly.
7. Eye complications: The patient has a corneal ulcer and may experience eye complications if not managed properly.
8. Liver damage: The patient's LFTs are improving, but the etiology is unclear, and he may experience liver damage if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's altered mental status with minimal medications and frequent re-orientation.
3. Monitor the patient's electrolyte abnormalities and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
4. Consider weaning the patient off his ventilator if his respiratory status improves.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's LFTs and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
6. Consider referring the patient to a rehabilitation facility once his medical status improves."

   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm
   - Taper clonodine
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days (today is day #2), then 0.1 mg
   daily x3 days, then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient on trache mask yesterday, had an
   episode of desaturation so placed back on vent.  Per notes seems to
   have been related to secretions. CXR today does appear improved, making
   PNA less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several
   more ABx
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. PT was
   started on cefepime, vanco and cipro, but in the setting of negative
   cultures will plan to d/c these antibiotics. Also trying to minimize
   medications in the setting of confusion and agitation. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 26 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Also increase seroquel given that he has had
   periods where he appears more normal and then periods where he appears
   more confused (waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]).
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Will contact pharmacy about how to wean safely.
   - Seroquel 25 mg TID for agitation.
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he

   episode of desaturation so placed back on vent.  Per notes seems to
   have been related to secretions. CXR today does appear improved, making
   PNA less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male admitted with neurologic changes and diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis. He has been treated with ceftriaxone for 26 days out of a planned 28-day course. The patient has persistent neurologic deficits and is experiencing agitation and altered mental status, which is managed with PRN haldol and seroquel.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a tracheostomy tube in place and mechanical ventilation. He has had episodes of desaturation related to secretions, but his CXR appears improved, making pneumonia less likely.

The patient's fever has been low-grade and has been afebrile since October 16. He has had negative cultures, and his antibiotic regimen has been adjusted accordingly.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, which are improving, but the etiology is unclear. He has also had an accelerated idioventricular rhythm, which was managed with metoprolol.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he is at risk for further episodes of desaturation and respiratory failure.
2. Infection: Despite negative cultures, the patient is at risk for further infections, particularly given his immunocompromised state.
3. Neurologic deficits: The patient has persistent neurologic deficits, which may not improve or may worsen over time.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate ongoing liver damage or dysfunction.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's accelerated idioventricular rhythm may be a sign of underlying cardiac disease or may be a complication of his Lyme encephalitis.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's altered mental status and decreased mobility may increase his risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation and aspiration.
7. Pressure ulcers: The patient's decreased mobility and altered mental status may increase his risk for pressure ulcers.

In terms of treatment, the patient's antibiotic regimen has been adjusted to minimize unnecessary medications and to target potential infections. His respiratory status will continue to be monitored, and his tracheostomy tube will be weaned as tolerated. His liver enzymes will continue to be trended, and his cardiovascular status will be monitored for any signs of worsening.

The patient's family has been informed of his condition, and his code status is full code. His disposition is pending clinical improvement, and he will eventually be transferred to a rehabilitation facility for further care and management."

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 26 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Also increase seroquel given that he has had
   periods where he appears more normal and then periods where he appears
   more confused (waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]).
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Will contact pharmacy about how to wean safely.
   - Seroquel 25 mg TID for agitation
 increase to 50 mg TID.
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  Patient has periods
   of apnea when sleeping. Trache mask trial today.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm
   - Taper clonodine
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days (today is day #2), then 0.1 mg
   daily x3 days, then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several
   more ABx
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. PT was
   started on cefepime, vanco and cipro, but in the setting of negative
   cultures will plan to d/c these antibiotics. Also trying to minimize
   medications in the setting of confusion and agitation. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 PICC LINE - START [**2102-10-20**] 01:24 PM
   - f/u XRay for PICC: in low SVC. Small R pleural effusion decreased but
   R lung base remains elevated and atelectatic. Atelectasis of L base has
   improved
   - Clonidine taper: 0.1mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days, then 0.1mg daily x3days, then OFF
   - Cdiff negative
   - Off ABx except Ceftriaxone for the Lyme and watch to see if he
   re-spikes or WBC's increase...if there is an infxn let it declare
   itself
   - Quiet after Quietiapine
   - Family mtg today: goals are wean from the ventilator, improve mental
   status by streamlining medications and to continue to search for any
   sources and signs of infection.  Long Term Acute Rehab was discussed as
   the most likely next destination and the family is planning on visiting
   some facilities in the near future.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with neurologic changes and suspected Lyme encephalitis. He has been treated with ceftriaxone for 26 days and is expected to complete a 28-day course. The patient has continued to experience altered mental status, agitation, and respiratory failure. He has had periods of apnea when sleeping and is currently on a vent wean as tolerated. The patient's respiratory status is improving, with a recent CXR showing decreased atelectasis and improved lung clarity.

The patient has also experienced hypotension, which has responded to IV fluids and antibiotic treatment. His blood pressure has been stable, and he is no longer taking clonodine. The patient has a history of chronic pain and is currently taking methadone, which will be weaned off as not clear that he is in pain and needs it.

The patient has had elevated liver enzymes, which are improving, and is being monitored for further changes. He has also had a corneal ulcer, which is being treated with antibiotics and ointment. The patient's electrolytes are being trended and corrected as needed.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he may still experience periods of apnea and respiratory failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been stable, but he may still experience episodes of hypotension.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may persist, and he may still experience agitation and confusion.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his immunocompromised state and the presence of a central line.
5. Liver damage: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver damage, which could be a complication of his treatment or a sign of a underlying condition.
6. Corneal ulcer: The patient's corneal ulcer may not heal properly, leading to potential vision loss.
7. Chronic pain: The patient's chronic pain may not be adequately managed, leading to potential complications such as addiction or decreased quality of life.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his treatment as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's hypotension and adjust his treatment as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's altered mental status and adjust his treatment as needed.
4. Monitor the patient for signs of infection and adjust his treatment as needed.
5. Continue to trend the patient's liver enzymes and adjust his treatment as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's corneal ulcer and adjust his treatment as needed.
7. Consider weaning the patient off methadone and adjusting his pain management plan as needed.
8. Consider referring the patient to a pain management specialist for further evaluation and treatment."

   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 26 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Also increase seroquel given that he has had
   periods where he appears more normal and then periods where he appears
   more confused (waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]).
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering
   - Seroquel 25 mg TID for agitation
 increase to 25 mg qAM, qafternoon
   and then 50mg QHS.
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  Patient has periods
   of apnea when sleeping. Trache mask trial today.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb has been trending up. Will check urine
   chloride to assess if possibly volume depleted.
   -ABG
   -Urine chloride
   -Will give diamox
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm
   - Taper clonodine
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days (today is day #2), then 0.1 mg
   daily x3 days, then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several
   more ABx
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. PT was
   started on cefepime, vanco and cipro, but in the setting of negative
   cultures will plan to d/c these antibiotics. Also trying to minimize
   medications in the setting of confusion and agitation. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 26 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Also increase seroquel given that he has had
   periods where he appears more normal and then periods where he appears
   more confused (waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]).
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering
   - Seroquel 25 mg TID for agitation
 increase to 25 mg qAM, qafternoon
   and then 50mg QHS.
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  Patient has periods
   of apnea when sleeping. Trache mask trial today.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb has been trending up. Will check urine
   chloride to assess if possibly volume depleted.
   -ABG
   -Urine chloride
   -Will give diamox
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm
   - Taper clonodine
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days (today is day #2), then 0.1 mg
   daily x3 days, then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several
   more ABx
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. PT was
   started on cefepime, vanco and cipro, but in the setting of negative
   cultures will plan to d/c these antibiotics. Also trying to minimize
   medications in the setting of confusion and agitation. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with neurologic changes and a diagnosis of Lyme encephalitis. He has been treated with ceftriaxone for 26 days and is expected to complete a 28-day course. The patient's condition has been stable, but he remains altered and agitated, with periods of apnea when sleeping. He has a tracheostomy tube in place and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient's respiratory status has improved, but he still has bilateral base opacification on CXR, which may be due to atelectasis or pneumonia. His metabolic alkalosis is being monitored, and he has been started on diamox. He has hypotension, which has responded to IV fluids, and has been started on vanc, cefepime, and cipro for a presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia. His corneal ulcer is being treated with vigamox and bacitracin ointment, and his elevated LFTs are being trended.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and he may require further weaning from mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's CXR shows bilateral base opacification, which may be due to pneumonia. He has been started on antibiotics, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of his respiratory symptoms.
3. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's bicarbonate levels are trending up, and he may require further evaluation to determine the cause of his metabolic alkalosis.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has responded to IV fluids, but he may require further treatment to maintain his blood pressure.
5. Corneal ulcer: The patient's corneal ulcer is being treated, but he may require further evaluation and treatment to prevent further complications.
6. Elevated LFTs: The patient's elevated LFTs are being trended, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of his liver dysfunction.
7. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm: The patient has an accelerated idioventricular rhythm, which may be related to his Lyme disease or other underlying conditions. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of his arrhythmia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his mechanical ventilation as needed.
2. Further evaluate the patient's bilateral base opacification on CXR to determine the cause of his respiratory symptoms.
3. Continue to trend the patient's metabolic alkalosis and adjust his treatment as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust his treatment as needed.
5. Continue to treat the patient's corneal ulcer and monitor for further complications.
6. Continue to trend the patient's elevated LFTs and adjust his treatment as needed.
7. Further evaluate the patient's accelerated idioventricular rhythm and adjust his treatment as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition remains critical with ongoing respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS). The patient's pCO2 levels are rising, and acetazolamide was started to address this issue.

The patient's mental status is altered, but not delirium. The patient's muscle performance, balance, and transfers are impaired, and there is an alteration in elimination related to constipation.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.1, hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 317 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, with the exception of chloride levels, which are 61 mEq/L, suggesting the patient is not fluid-responsive.

The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, and an FiO2 of 50%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.43, pCO2 of 65 mmHg, and pO2 of 133 mmHg.

The patient's imaging studies, including a CXR, show the tip of the right PICC line in the lateral right subclavian vein or axillary vein, and the tracheostomy tube is 5.5 cm above the carina.

The patient's medications include ceftriaxone, famotidine, and heparin sodium. The patient's allergies include ativan, ibuprofen, and unknown.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a critical condition that requires close monitoring and management. The patient's pCO2 levels are rising, and acetazolamide was started to address this issue. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, mechanical ventilation, and an FiO2 of 50%.
2. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is 8.1, which is within normal range. However, the patient's platelet count is 317 K/uL, which is low. The patient's lactate level is 0.7 mmol/L, which is within normal range. The patient's blood cultures are negative, but the patient's respiratory status and cardiac status require close monitoring.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is critical, and the patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient's blood pressure is 129/90 mmHg, which is within normal range. The patient's cardiac enzymes, including troponin-T, are within normal range.
4. Renal complications: The patient's renal function is critical, and the patient's creatinine level is 0.5 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels, including potassium, sodium, and chloride, are within normal range. The patient's urine output is 1,755 mL, which is within normal range.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is critical, and the patient's mental status is altered. The patient's muscle performance, balance, and transfers are impaired. The patient's neurological status requires close monitoring and management.

In conclusion, the patient's condition remains critical, and the patient requires close monitoring and management. The patient's respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiac complications, renal complications, and neurological complications require careful attention and management to prevent further deterioration."

   - ABG - rising pCO2 and bicarb. Started acetazolamide.
   - neuro recs
   - changed Seroquel to 25, 25, 50.
   - Urine lytes -> Cl 61 suggesting he is not fluid down.
   - slightly positive - gave 10mg IV lasix as he is relatively lasix
   naive.  Goal is -500ccs.
   - Pulled PICC out ~5cm at 11:30pm.  Seen by IV nurse who said that it
   can still be used as IV access but not as central line.  On IV drug
   currently is ceftriaxone.

   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 26 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Also increase seroquel given that he has had
   periods where he appears more normal and then periods where he appears
   more confused (waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]).
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering
   - Seroquel 25 mg TID for agitation
 increase to 25 mg qAM, q afternoon
   and then 50mg QHS.
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  Patient has periods

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted with neurologic changes and suspected Lyme encephalitis. He has been treated with ceftriaxone for 26 days and is expected to complete a 4-week course. The patient has ongoing altered mental status, agitation, and confusion, which is being managed with medications such as Seroquel and Haldol. He also has respiratory failure, which is being treated with mechanical ventilation, and has periods of apnea when sleeping.

The patient has had several complications, including hypotension, which has responded to IV fluids and antibiotics. He has also had a corneal ulcer, which is being treated with ophthalmology recommendations. His laboratory results show elevated LFTs, which are improving, and he has been diagnosed with an accelerated idioventricular rhythm, which is being managed with metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Infectious complications: The patient has been treated with antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia, but there is still a risk of further infection.
3. Neurologic complications: The patient's altered mental status and agitation may worsen, and there is a risk of further neurologic deficits.
4. Metabolic complications: The patient's metabolic alkalosis may worsen, and there is a risk of electrolyte imbalances.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's accelerated idioventricular rhythm may worsen, and there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Corneal ulcer complications: The patient's corneal ulcer may worsen, and there is a risk of vision loss.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's tube feeds may not be providing adequate nutrition, and there is a risk of gastrointestinal complications such as diarrhea or constipation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment as necessary.
2. Continue to treat the patient's suspected Lyme encephalitis with ceftriaxone.
3. Manage the patient's agitation and altered mental status with medications such as Seroquel and Haldol.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment as necessary to manage metabolic alkalosis.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment as necessary to manage accelerated idioventricular rhythm.
6. Continue to treat the patient's corneal ulcer with ophthalmology recommendations.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust treatment as necessary to manage tube feeds and prevent gastrointestinal complications."

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 27 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Seroquel increased yesterday, only overnight
   dose. Per nursing patient slept through the night but seems still very
   out of it this morning. [**Month (only) 11**] want to see if we can give 37.5 qHS instead
   of 50.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering. Today day #2 of 3 days at 7.5 TID,
   then will go to 3 days at 5 TID, 3 days at 2.5 TID until taper done.
   - Seroquel 25 mg TID for agitation
 increase to 25 mg qAM, q afternoon
   and then 37.5 mg QHS.
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  Patient has periods
   of apnea when sleeping. Trache mask trial today.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal.
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, patient did have some of his episodes of
   hypotension immediately after seroquel evening dose.
   - Taper clonodine
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days (today is day #3), then 0.1 mg
   daily x3 days, then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several
   more ABx
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. PT was
   started on cefepime, vanco and cipro, but in the setting of negative
   cultures will plan to d/c these antibiotics. Also trying to minimize
   medications in the setting of confusion and agitation. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Improving though.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - ABG - rising pCO2 and bicarb. Started acetazolamide.
   - neuro recs
   - changed Seroquel to 25, 25, 50.
   - Urine lytes -> Cl 61 suggesting he is not fluid down.
   - slightly positive - gave 10mg IV lasix as he is relatively lasix
   naive.  Goal is -500ccs.
   - Pulled PICC out ~5cm at 11:30pm.  Seen by IV nurse who said that it
   can still be used as IV access but not as central line.  On IV drug
   currently is ceftriaxone.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, ITP, and Lyme disease, admitted with neurologic changes and encephalitis. He has been treated with ceftriaxone for 27 days and is expected to complete a 28-day course. The patient has persistent neurologic deficits, agitation, and altered mental status, which may be related to encephalitis, electrolyte abnormalities, or concurrent infections. He has also been experiencing periods of apnea, hypotension, and fever.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has periods of apnea and is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's bicarbonate levels are elevated, and he has been treated with acetazolamide to reduce this.
3. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which may be related to medications, infection, or other underlying conditions.
4. Fever: The patient has had a low-grade fever, which may be related to an underlying infection or other condition.
5. Corneal ulcer: The patient has a corneal ulcer, which may be related to his neurologic deficits and inability to protect his eyes.
6. Elevated LFTs: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, which may be related to ceftriaxone or other medications.
7. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm: The patient has been diagnosed with an accelerated idioventricular rhythm, which may be related to his medications or underlying condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as needed.
2. Continue to manage his metabolic alkalosis with acetazolamide and monitor his electrolyte levels.
3. Continue to treat his hypotension with IV fluids and medications as needed.
4. Continue to monitor his fever and adjust his antibiotics as needed.
5. Continue to treat his corneal ulcer with topical antibiotics and monitor his eye health.
6. Continue to monitor his liver function tests and adjust his medications as needed.
7. Continue to monitor his accelerated idioventricular rhythm and adjust his medications as needed.

ICU care:

1. Nutrition: The patient is receiving tube feeds and should continue to receive a balanced diet to support his nutritional needs.
2. Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels should be monitored and adjusted as needed to prevent hyperglycemia.
3. Lines: The patient has a PICC line in place, which should be monitored for any signs of infection or other complications.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin and should continue to receive this medication to prevent DVT.
5. Code status: The patient has a full code status, which means that all efforts should be made to resuscitate him in the event of a cardiac arrest."

   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 27 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Seroquel increased yesterday, only overnight
   dose. Per nursing patient slept through the night but seems still very
   out of it this morning.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering. Today day #3 of 3 days at 7.5 TID,
   then will go to 3 days at 5 TID, 3 days at 2.5 TID until taper done.
   - Decrease Seroquel 25 mg TID for agitation
   -EKG to assess QTc in setting of seroquel usage
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  Patient has periods
   of apnea when sleeping. Will decrease Seroquel as patient did appear
   apneic overnight, overly sedated a possibility. Trache mask trial
   today.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source. Will not give more acetazolamide at this
   time, but continue to monitor.
   -ABG tomorrow
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, patient did have some of his episodes of
   hypotension immediately after seroquel evening dose.
   - Taper clonodine
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days (today is day #3), then 0.1 mg
   daily x3 days, then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   -Timing of meds: patient is getting many of his medications together,
   may be causing hypotensive periods. Nursing will work on timing meds
   better today.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several
   more ABx
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. PT was
   started on cefepime, vanco and cipro, but in the setting of negative
   cultures will plan to d/c these antibiotics. Also trying to minimize
   medications in the setting of confusion and agitation. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   #Hypernatremia: free water 250 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 27 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Seroquel increased yesterday, only overnight
   dose. Per nursing patient slept through the night but seems still very
   out of it this morning.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering. Today day #3 of 3 days at 7.5 TID,
   then will go to 3 days at 5 TID, 3 days at 2.5 TID until taper done.
   - Decrease Seroquel 25 mg TID for agitation
   -EKG to assess QTc in setting of seroquel usage
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  Patient has periods
   of apnea when sleeping. Will decrease Seroquel as patient did appear
   apneic overnight, overly sedated a possibility. Trache mask trial
   today.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source. Will not give more acetazolamide at this
   time, but continue to monitor.
   -ABG tomorrow
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, patient did have some of his episodes of
   hypotension immediately after seroquel evening dose.
   - Taper clonodine
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days (today is day #3), then 0.1 mg
   daily x3 days, then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   -Timing of meds: patient is getting many of his medications together,
   may be causing hypotensive periods. Nursing will work on timing meds
   better today.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several
   more ABx
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. PT was
   started on cefepime, vanco and cipro, but in the setting of negative
   cultures will plan to d/c these antibiotics. Also trying to minimize
   medications in the setting of confusion and agitation. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   #Hypernatremia: free water 250 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, ITP, and Lyme disease, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have Lyme encephalitis. He has been on a stable treatment course with ceftriaxone for 27 days and is expected to complete the 28-day course. The patient has persistent neurologic deficits and is at risk for permanent deficits.

Current issues:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has periods of apnea when sleeping and is on a ventilator. The CXR appears improved, making pneumonia less likely.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's bicarbonate levels have normalized, but the source of the alkalosis is unclear. Further monitoring is necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient has had periods of hypotension, which has responded to IV fluids and antibiotics. The antihypertensives will be tapered to see if this improves.
4. Fever: The patient has had daily low-grade temperatures, but has been afebrile since October 16th. Recent cultures have been negative, and antibiotics will be discontinued.
5. Corneal ulcer: The patient has a corneal ulcer, likely related to his neurologic deficits.
6. Elevated LFTs: The patient's LFTs have normalized, but the etiology is unclear. Further monitoring is necessary.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is being addressed with free water and tube feeding.
8. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm: The patient has an accelerated idioventricular rhythm, which is being monitored.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient may require continued ventilator support or may experience respiratory failure if the underlying condition is not addressed.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient may experience further alkalosis or other electrolyte imbalances if the underlying cause is not identified and treated.
3. Hypotension: The patient may experience further hypotension or other cardiovascular complications if the underlying cause is not addressed.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infection, particularly in the setting of his compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization.
5. Corneal ulcer: The patient may experience further complications from the corneal ulcer, including vision loss or infection.
6. Elevated LFTs: The patient may experience further liver damage or other complications if the underlying cause of the elevated LFTs is not identified and treated.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient may experience further complications from the hypernatremia, including seizures or other neurological symptoms.
8. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm: The patient may experience further cardiac complications, including arrhythmias or cardiac arrest, if the underlying cause is not addressed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilator support as necessary.
2. Further investigate the cause of the patient's metabolic alkalosis and hypernatremia.
3. Taper the patient's antihypertensives and monitor for further hypotension.
4. Discontinue antibiotics and monitor for further infection.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's corneal ulcer and consider further treatment.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's LFTs and consider further treatment if necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's hypernatremia and adjust treatment as necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's accelerated idioventricular rhythm and consider further treatment if necessary."

   - slightly positive - gave 10mg IV lasix as he is relatively lasix
   naive.  Goal is -500ccs.
   - Pulled PICC out ~5cm at 11:30pm.  Seen by IV nurse who said that it
   can still be used as IV access but not as central line.  On IV drug
   currently is ceftriaxone.

   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy
 Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 27 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Seroquel increased yesterday, only overnight
   dose. Per nursing patient slept through the night but seems still very
   out of it this morning.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering. Today day #3 of 3 days at 7.5 TID,
   then will go to 3 days at 5 TID, 3 days at 2.5 TID until taper done.
   - Decrease Seroquel 25 mg TID for agitation
   -EKG to assess QTc in setting of seroquel usage
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  Patient has periods
   of apnea when sleeping. Will decrease Seroquel as patient did appear
   apneic overnight, overly sedated a possibility. Trache mask trial
   today.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source. Will not give more acetazolamide at this
   time, but continue to monitor.
   -ABG tomorrow
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, patient did have some of his episodes of
   hypotension immediately after seroquel evening dose.
   - Taper clonodine
   -Clonodine taper: 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **] x3 days (today is day #3), then 0.1 mg
   daily x3 days, then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   -Timing of meds: patient is getting many of his medications together,
   may be causing hypotensive periods. Nursing will work on timing meds
   better today.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several
   more ABx
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. PT was
   started on cefepime, vanco and cipro, but in the setting of negative
   cultures will plan to d/c these antibiotics. Also trying to minimize
   medications in the setting of confusion and agitation. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   #Hypernatremia: free water 250 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - ABG - rising pCO2 and bicarb. Started acetazolamide.
   - neuro recs
   - changed Seroquel to 25, 25, 50.
   - Urine lytes -> Cl 61 suggesting he is not fluid down.
   - slightly positive - gave 10mg IV lasix as he is relatively lasix
   naive.  Goal is -500ccs.
   - Pulled PICC out ~5cm at 11:30pm.  Seen by IV nurse who said that it
   can still be used as IV access but not as central line.  On IV drug
   currently is ceftriaxone.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, ITP, and lyme encephalitis. He was admitted with neurologic changes and found to have lyme encephalitis. He has been on a stable treatment course for 27 days with ceftriaxone. The patient is currently experiencing agitation, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. He has a tracheostomy tube in place and is on mechanical ventilation. His laboratory results show elevated LFTs, which have normalized, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and he is experiencing periods of apnea when sleeping. This may lead to further respiratory failure and potential complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Neurologic Deficits: The patient has persistent neurologic deficits, including altered mental status, agitation, and potential for permanent deficits. This may impact his quality of life and ability to recover.
3. Infections: The patient has a history of lyme encephalitis and is at risk for further infections, particularly given his compromised immune system.
4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which may be related to the ceftriaxone treatment. This may lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances.
5. Hypotension: The patient has experienced periods of hypotension, which may be related to his medications, particularly the Seroquel. This may lead to further complications, such as organ damage or shock.
6. Corneal Ulcer: The patient has a corneal ulcer, which may lead to further complications, such as vision loss or infection.
7. Elevated LFTs: The patient's elevated LFTs may be related to the ceftriaxone treatment or another underlying condition. This may lead to further complications, such as liver damage or failure.
8. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to further complications, such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or seizures.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his mechanical ventilation as necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's neurologic status and adjust his medications as necessary to manage his agitation and altered mental status.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's laboratory results, including his LFTs and electrolyte levels, and adjust his treatment plan as necessary.
4. Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's corneal ulcer, including ophthalmology consultation.
5. Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's hypernatremia, including fluid management and electrolyte replacement.
6. Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's potential infections, including antibiotic management and further diagnostic testing.
7. Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's potential complications, such as respiratory failure, neurologic deficits, and metabolic alkalosis."

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy--Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 28 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. PM Seroquel dose has been increased but 8am
   and 2pm doses have been decreased.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering. Today day #1 of 3 days at 5 TID, then
   will go to 3 days at 2.5 TID
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg
   -EKG to assess QTc in setting of seroquel usage
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  Patient has periods
   of apnea when sleeping. Will decrease Seroquel as patient did appear
   apneic overnight, overly sedated a possibility. Trache mask trial
   today.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source. Will not give more acetazolamide at this
   time, but continue to monitor.
   -ABG today to reassess
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, patient did have some of his episodes of
   hypotension immediately after seroquel evening dose.
   - Currently tapering clonodine
   - Clonodine taper: today will go down to 0.1mg daily x3 days, then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   -Timing of meds: patient is getting many of his medications together,
   may be causing hypotensive periods. Touch base with nursing to ensure
   staggered timing of meds
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several
   more ABx
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. PT was
   started on cefepime, vanco and cipro, but in the setting of negative
   cultures will plan to d/c these antibiotics. Also trying to minimize
   medications in the setting of confusion and agitation. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   - Pt now had low grade 100.1 temp overnight. Today he is ending his
   course of Ceftriaxone for the Lyme.
   - Plan was that we were d/c'ing ABx and waiting for an infection to
   declare itself if there was one present. If he continues to be febrile
   and WBC's increase will need to reconsider adding ABx, wiill watch
   through today
   - If febrile again, needs recultures of everything
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   #Hypernatremia: free water 250 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   - F/u PM lytes today
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.
   FEN: correct/replete electrolytes, tube feeds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   apneic overnight, overly sedated a possibility. Trache mask trial
   today.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source. Will not give more acetazolamide at this
   time, but continue to monitor.
   -ABG today to reassess
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, patient did have some of his episodes of
   hypotension immediately after seroquel evening dose.
   - Currently tapering clonodine
   - Clonodine taper: today will go down to 0.1mg daily x3 days, then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   -Timing of meds: patient is getting many of his medications together,
   may be causing hypotensive periods. Touch base with nursing to ensure
   staggered timing of meds
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), but has been
   afebrile since [**2102-10-16**] at 4pm. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several
   more ABx
s were added on due to transient hypotense episodes. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. PT was
   started on cefepime, vanco and cipro, but in the setting of negative
   cultures will plan to d/c these antibiotics. Also trying to minimize
   medications in the setting of confusion and agitation. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   - Pt now had low grade 100.1 temp overnight. Today he is ending his
   course of Ceftriaxone for the Lyme.
   - Plan was that we were d/c'ing ABx and waiting for an infection to
   declare itself if there was one present. If he continues to be febrile
   and WBC's increase will need to reconsider adding ABx, wiill watch
   through today
   - If febrile again, needs recultures of everything
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs..
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   #Hypernatremia: free water 250 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   - F/u PM lytes today
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, and their current condition is improving, but they are still dependent on a ventilator. There is a risk of further respiratory decline if their condition worsens.
2. Neurological Deficits: The patient has persistent neurological deficits, which may not be fully reversible. There is a risk of further neurological decline or worsening of their existing deficits.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of infections, including Lyme disease, and is at risk of developing further infections, particularly given their immunocompromised state.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has hypernatremia, which can lead to further complications if not properly managed.
5. Medication-Related Complications: The patient is taking multiple medications, which can interact with each other and cause adverse effects. There is a risk of medication-related complications, such as hypotension, respiratory depression, or gastrointestinal upset.
6. Constipation: The patient has a history of constipation, which can lead to further complications if not properly managed.
7. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia, which can lead to further complications if not properly managed.
8. Corneal Ulcer: The patient has a corneal ulcer, which can lead to further complications if not properly managed.
9. Elevated Liver Function Tests: The patient has elevated liver function tests, which can indicate liver damage or dysfunction.
10. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm: The patient has an accelerated idioventricular rhythm, which can lead to further complications if not properly managed.

To address these potential complications, the patient should continue to receive close monitoring and management, including:

1. Ongoing respiratory support and weaning from the ventilator as tolerated.
2. Neurological evaluation and management to address any further neurological decline or worsening of existing deficits.
3. Infection prevention and management, including continued antibiotic treatment and monitoring for signs of infection.
4. Electrolyte management to address hypernatremia and prevent further complications.
5. Medication management to minimize medication-related complications and optimize therapy.
6. Constipation management to prevent further complications.
7. Pneumonia management to prevent further complications.
8. Corneal ulcer management to prevent further complications.
9. Liver function test monitoring to address any further liver damage or dysfunction.
10. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm management to prevent further complications.

The patient should also be closely monitored for any signs of worsening or new complications, and their care plan should be adjusted accordingly."

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fevers.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone which is to end today.  With some persistent neurologic
   deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy--Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 28 of 28, and will d/c after
   today
   - Will not restart other ABx for now
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. PM Seroquel dose has been increased but 8am
   and 2pm doses have been decreased.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering. Today day #1 of 3 days at 5 TID, then
   will go to 3 days at 2.5 TID
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg
   - Needs EKG monitoring of QRS
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  He has been on
   extended time period so trach collar and does well with it.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   - Will get ABG today
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source. Will not give more acetazolamide at this
   time, but continue to monitor.
   -ABG today to reassess
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro

   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), then was
   afebrile for a while, but now having some low grade temps more
   recently. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on
   due to transient hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with
   the idea that if he has a true infection, it would declare itself with
   elevated WBC
s and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   - Pt now had low grade 100.1 temp overnight. Today he is ending his
   course of Ceftriaxone for the Lyme.
   - If febrile again, needs recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs.
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   #Hypernatremia: free water 250 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   - F/u PM lytes today
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fevers.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone which is to end today.  With some persistent neurologic
   deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy--Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 28 of 28, and will d/c after
   today
   - Will not restart other ABx for now
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. PM Seroquel dose has been increased but 8am
   and 2pm doses have been decreased.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering. Today day #1 of 3 days at 5 TID, then
   will go to 3 days at 2.5 TID
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg
   - Needs EKG monitoring of QRS
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  He has been on
   extended time period so trach collar and does well with it.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   - Will get ABG today
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source. Will not give more acetazolamide at this
   time, but continue to monitor.
   -ABG today to reassess
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, patient did have some of his episodes of
   hypotension immediately after seroquel evening dose.
   - Currently tapering clonodine
   - Clonodine taper: today will go down to 0.1mg daily x3 days, then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   -Timing of meds: patient is getting many of his medications together,
   may be causing hypotensive periods. Touch base with nursing to ensure
   staggered timing of meds
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), then was
   afebrile for a while, but now having some low grade temps more
   recently. Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on
   due to transient hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with
   the idea that if he has a true infection, it would declare itself with
   elevated WBC
s and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme for which he is almost done
   with 4wk course of Ceftriaxone.
   - Pt now had low grade 100.1 temp overnight. Today he is ending his
   course of Ceftriaxone for the Lyme.
   - If febrile again, needs recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs.
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   #Hypernatremia: free water 250 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   - F/u PM lytes today
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.
   FEN: correct/replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2B
   Access: Peripherals, PICC was pulled out a little bit 2 days ago, but

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, ITP, and Lyme disease, admitted with neurologic changes and fevers. He was diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis and is currently on a 28-day course of ceftriaxone, which is nearing completion. The patient has experienced altered mental status, agitation, and respiratory failure, and is currently on a tracheostomy tube. He has also had episodes of hypotension, fever, and corneal ulceration. His laboratory results show elevated LFTs, hypernatremia, and a low white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to his underlying lung disease and his current condition. He is at risk for further deterioration and may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient's low-grade fever and negative cultures suggest that he may have a persistent infection. He is at risk for developing sepsis and septic shock if his infection is not properly treated.
3. Neurologic deficits: The patient's neurologic deficits may be permanent, and he may require ongoing rehabilitation to improve his functional status.
4. Corneal ulceration: The patient's corneal ulceration is likely related to his inability to protect his eye due to his neurologic deficits. He is at risk for further complications, such as vision loss and corneal perforation.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypernatremia is likely due to his underlying condition and may require ongoing monitoring and treatment.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's accelerated idioventricular rhythm may be a sign of cardiac compromise, and he is at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias or even cardiac arrest.
7. Constipation: The patient's altered mental status and decreased mobility may make him prone to constipation, which can lead to further complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
8. Wound infection: The patient's corneal ulceration may be at risk for infection, which can lead to further complications, such as endophthalmitis or orbital cellulitis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide mechanical ventilation as needed.
2. Administer antibiotics as prescribed and monitor for signs of infection.
3. Provide ongoing rehabilitation to improve the patient's functional status and reduce the risk of further neurologic deficits.
4. Monitor the patient's corneal ulceration and provide ongoing treatment to prevent further complications.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and provide ongoing treatment as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and provide ongoing treatment as needed to prevent cardiac complications.
7. Provide ongoing treatment for constipation and monitor for signs of bowel obstruction or perforation.
8. Monitor the patient's wound infection and provide ongoing treatment as needed to prevent further complications."

   is normal. Unclear source. Will not give more acetazolamide at this

   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, patient did have some of his episodes of
   hypotension immediately after seroquel evening dose.

   - Clonodine taper: today will go down to 0.1mg daily x3 days, then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.

   may be causing hypotensive periods. Touch base with nursing to ensure
   staggered timing of meds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fever.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  On stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with
   ceftriaxone.  With some persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Have spoke to pharmacy--Cefipime not good Lyme coverage and
   Ceftriaxone not good Pseudomonas coverage.
   - 28 day course of ceftriaxone
 now day 28 of 28.
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. PM Seroquel dose has been increased but 8am
   and 2pm doses have been decreased.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering. Today day #1 of 3 days at 5 TID, then
   will go to 3 days at 2.5 TID
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg
   -EKG to assess QTc in setting of seroquel usage
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  Patient has periods
   of apnea when sleeping. Will decrease Seroquel as patient did appear
   apneic overnight, overly sedated a possibility. Trache mask trial
   today.
   - Continue vent wean as tolerated
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source. Will not give more acetazolamide at this
   time, but continue to monitor.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male admitted with neurologic changes and found to have Lyme encephalitis. He has been on a stable treatment course for planned 4 weeks with ceftriaxone. The patient has continued to have altered mental status, fever, and respiratory failure.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, and his respiratory status is being closely monitored. He has periods of apnea when sleeping, and his tracheostomy tube is being weaned as tolerated.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, and his bicarbonate levels have normalized. However, the cause of this condition is unclear, and it may be related to his underlying medical conditions or medications.
3. Hypotension: The patient has had periods of hypotension, which has responded to IV fluids and antibiotics. His blood pressure is being closely monitored, and his medications are being adjusted to minimize the risk of further hypotension.
4. Fever: The patient has had a low-grade fever, which has been present for several days. His antibiotic therapy is being adjusted to minimize the risk of further infection.
5. Corneal ulcer: The patient has a corneal ulcer, which is likely related to his inability to protect his eye due to his neurologic deficits.
6. Elevated LFTs: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which have normalized. The cause of this condition is unclear, and it may be related to his underlying medical conditions or medications.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is being treated with free water and tube feeding.

The patient's current medications include:

* Ceftriaxone: The patient has completed his 4-week course of ceftriaxone for Lyme disease.
* Seroquel: The patient is taking Seroquel for agitation and altered mental status.
* Methadone: The patient is taking Methadone for chronic pain control, but it is being tapered off.
* Clonidine: The patient is taking Clonidine for hypertension, but it is being tapered off.
* Heparin: The patient is taking subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis.
* Famotidine: The patient is taking Famotidine for prophylaxis.
* Furosemide: The patient is taking Furosemide for fluid management.

The patient's medical history includes:

* Hypertension
* ITP
* Neurologic changes
* Lyme encephalitis
* Accelerated idioventricular rhythm
* Corneal ulcer

The patient's current status is:

* Altered mental status
* Fever
* Respiratory failure
* Hypotension
* Hypernatremia
* Corneal ulcer
* Elevated LFTs

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Monitoring of his respiratory status
* Adjusting his antibiotic therapy as needed
* Managing his hypotension with IV fluids and medications

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fevers.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  Treated for 4 weeks with ceftriaxone.  With some
   persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Will not restart other ABx for now
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent
   -Rehab screening
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. PM Seroquel dose has been increased but 8am
   and 2pm doses have been decreased. Per nursing patient was again more
   agitated and confused overnight.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering. Today day #2 of 3 days at 5 TID, then
   will go to 3 days at 2.5 TID
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg; added PRN 25mg for
   agitation at night given that he was agitated last night
   - Needs EKG monitoring of QRS
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  He has been on
   extended time period of  trach collar and does well with it.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   - Will get ABG today
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   -Will discuss with renal attending tomorrow
   - Will not give more acetazolamide at this time, but continue to
   monitor.
   -ABG today to reassess
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, patient did have some of his episodes of
   hypotension immediately after seroquel evening dose.
   - Currently tapering clonodine
   - Clonodine taper: 0.1mg daily x3 days (on day 2), then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   -Timing of meds: patient is getting many of his medications together,
   may be causing hypotensive periods. Touch base with nursing to ensure
   staggered timing of meds
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), then was
   afebrile for a while, but now having some low grade temps more recently
   ([**10-24**]). Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on
   due to transient hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with
   the idea that if he has a true infection, it would declare itself with
   elevated WBC
s and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, needs recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs specifically duration of eye drops and f/u as
   outpatient
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   -Recheck LFTs tomorrow
   #Hypernatremia: free water 250 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.
   FEN: correct/replete electrolytes, tube feeds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, fevers, and neurologic changes suspected to be due to Lyme encephalitis. He has been treated with ceftriaxone for four weeks and has some persistent neurologic deficits. The patient is agitated and confused, with a history of chronic narcotic use. He has been on Methadone for chronic pain control, but it is being tapered off as it is unclear if he is in pain and needs it. The patient has respiratory failure, metabolic alkalosis, and hypotension, which has resolved with IV fluids and antibiotics. He also has a corneal ulcer and elevated LFTs, which have normalized. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple factors, including electrolyte abnormalities, concurrent infections, and medication-related issues.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is impaired, and he requires prolonged use of a tracheostomy collar. There is a risk of respiratory failure if his respiratory status deteriorates further.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis is not fully understood and may be related to hypokalemia, which is not present. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and treatment plan.
3. Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypotension, which has resolved with IV fluids and antibiotics. However, there is a risk of recurrent hypotension if his medication regimen is not optimized.
4. Corneal ulcer: The patient has a corneal ulcer that requires ongoing management and follow-up with ophthalmology.
5. Elevated LFTs: The patient's elevated LFTs have normalized, but there is a risk of recurrence if his liver function is not closely monitored.
6. Neurologic deficits: The patient has persistent neurologic deficits suspected to be due to Lyme encephalitis. There is a risk of further neurologic deterioration if his condition is not managed appropriately.
7. Agitation and confusion: The patient's agitation and confusion may be related to his underlying condition, electrolyte abnormalities, or medication side effects. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and develop a treatment plan.
8. Infection: The patient has a low-grade fever and has been treated with antibiotics. However, there is a risk of recurrent infection if his underlying condition is not managed effectively.
9. Medication-related issues: The patient is taking multiple medications, including antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and pain medications. There is a risk of medication-related side effects, interactions, and adverse reactions if his medication regimen is not optimized."

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fevers.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  Treated for 4 weeks with ceftriaxone.  With some
   persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Will not restart other ABx for now
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent
   -Rehab screening
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. PM Seroquel dose has been increased but 8am
   and 2pm doses have been decreased. Per nursing patient was again more
   agitated and confused overnight.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering. Today day #2 of 3 days at 5 TID, then
   will go to 3 days at 2.5 TID
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg; added PRN 25mg for
   agitation at night given that he was agitated last night
   - Needs EKG monitoring of QRS
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  He has been on
   extended time period of  trach collar and does well with it.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   - Will get ABG today
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   -Will discuss with renal attending tomorrow
   - Will not give more acetazolamide at this time, but continue to
   monitor.
   -ABG today to reassess
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, patient did have some of his episodes of
   hypotension immediately after seroquel evening dose.
   - Currently tapering clonodine
   - Clonodine taper: 0.1mg daily x3 days (on day 2), then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   -Timing of meds: patient is getting many of his medications together,
   may be causing hypotensive periods. Touch base with nursing to ensure
   staggered timing of meds
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), then was
   afebrile for a while, but now having some low grade temps more recently
   ([**10-24**]). Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on
   due to transient hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with
   the idea that if he has a true infection, it would declare itself with
   elevated WBC
s and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, needs recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs specifically duration of eye drops and f/u as
   outpatient
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   -Recheck LFTs tomorrow
   #Hypernatremia: free water 250 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fevers.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  Treated for 4 weeks with ceftriaxone.  With some
   persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Will not restart other ABx for now
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent
   -Rehab screening
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. PM Seroquel dose has been increased but 8am
   and 2pm doses have been decreased. Per nursing patient was again more
   agitated and confused overnight.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering. Today day #2 of 3 days at 5 TID, then
   will go to 3 days at 2.5 TID
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg; added PRN 25mg for
   agitation at night given that he was agitated last night
   - Needs EKG monitoring of QRS
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  He has been on
   extended time period of  trach collar and does well with it.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   - Will get ABG today
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   -Will discuss with renal attending tomorrow
   - Will not give more acetazolamide at this time, but continue to
   monitor.
   -ABG today to reassess
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, patient did have some of his episodes of
   hypotension immediately after seroquel evening dose.
   - Currently tapering clonodine
   - Clonodine taper: 0.1mg daily x3 days (on day 2), then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   -Timing of meds: patient is getting many of his medications together,
   may be causing hypotensive periods. Touch base with nursing to ensure
   staggered timing of meds
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), then was
   afebrile for a while, but now having some low grade temps more recently
   ([**10-24**]). Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on
   due to transient hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with
   the idea that if he has a true infection, it would declare itself with
   elevated WBC
s and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, needs recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs specifically duration of eye drops and f/u as
   outpatient
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   -Recheck LFTs tomorrow
   #Hypernatremia: free water 250 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, ITP, and lyme encephalitis. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

The patient's neurological status has improved, but he remains agitated and confused. He has a history of chronic pain and is currently taking Methadone and Seroquel, which may be contributing to his agitation. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but he has a history of hypotension and may require further monitoring.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, but he still requires oxygen therapy and has a tracheostomy tube in place. He has a history of respiratory failure and may require further treatment.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated LFTs, which have normalized, and his WBC count is low. He has a history of Lyme disease and may require further treatment.

The patient's medication list includes:

* Ceftriaxone (antibiotic)
* Heparin (anticoagulant)
* Metoprolol (beta blocker)
* Seroquel (antipsychotic)
* Methadone (opioid)
* Vigamox and bacitracin ointment (eye medication)
* Fibersource HN (tube feeding)

The patient's medical complications include:

* Aroused, agitated, and confused
* Respiratory failure
* Metabolic alkalosis
* Hypotension
* Fever
* Corneal ulcer
* Elevated LFTs
* Hypernatremia
* Accelerated idioventricular rhythm

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue to monitor his neurological status and adjust his medication as needed
* Continue to provide respiratory support and monitor his oxygen saturation
* Continue to monitor his electrolyte levels and adjust his medication as needed
* Continue to provide pain management and adjust his medication as needed
* Continue to monitor his laboratory results and adjust his treatment as needed
* Consider restarting antibiotics if his fever persists
* Consider weaning him off of Methadone and Seroquel
* Continue to monitor his corneal ulcer and provide eye care as needed
* Continue to monitor his LFTs and adjust his treatment as needed
* Consider restarting antibiotics if his fever persists"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis.  Now transferred with continued altered mental
   status and fevers.
   # Lyme encephalitis.  Highly suspected based on MR findings, serum and
   CSF serologies.  Treated for 4 weeks with ceftriaxone.  With some
   persistent neurologic deficits.
   - Will not restart other ABx for now
   - Neurology following; unclear if deficits permanent
   -Rehab?
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. PM Seroquel dose has been increased but 8am
   and 2pm doses have been decreased. Per nursing patient was again more
   agitated and confused overnight.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering. Today day #2 of 3 days at 5 TID, then
   will go to 3 days at 2.5 TID
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg
   - Needs EKG monitoring of QRS
   # Respiratory failure: CXR yesterday does appear improved, making PNA
   less likely. Sputum cultures have been negative.  He has been on
   extended time period so trach collar and does well with it.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   - Will get ABG today
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source. Will not give more acetazolamide at this
   time, but continue to monitor.
   -ABG today to reassess
   # Hypotension: Has been having periods of hypotension with SBPs to
   80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime and cipro
   for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that showed
   possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, patient did have some of his episodes of
   hypotension immediately after seroquel evening dose.
   - Currently tapering clonodine
   - Clonodine taper: 0.1mg daily x3 days (on day 2), then off
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   -Timing of meds: patient is getting many of his medications together,
   may be causing hypotensive periods. Touch base with nursing to ensure
   staggered timing of meds
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), then was
   afebrile for a while, but now having some low grade temps more recently
   ([**10-24**]). Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on
   due to transient hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with
   the idea that if he has a true infection, it would declare itself with
   elevated WBC
s and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, needs recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs.
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   -Recheck LFTs tomorrow
   #Hypernatremia: free water 250 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.
   FEN: correct/replete electrolytes, tube feeds

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, and his condition may worsen if not managed properly.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's bicarbonate levels are elevated, which may be a sign of metabolic alkalosis. This condition can lead to muscle weakness, fatigue, and other symptoms if not addressed.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotensive episodes, which may be related to his medications, electrolyte imbalances, or other underlying conditions. If not managed properly, hypotension can lead to organ damage and other complications.
4. Fever: The patient has been experiencing low-grade temperatures, which may be a sign of an underlying infection. If not addressed, fever can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and other complications.
5. Corneal ulcer: The patient has a corneal ulcer that may be related to his neurologic deficits and inability to protect his eye. If not managed properly, the ulcer can lead to vision loss and other complications.
6. Elevated LFTs: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may be related to his antibiotics or other underlying conditions. If not addressed, elevated LFTs can lead to liver damage and other complications.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which may be related to his tube feeding and electrolyte imbalances. If not managed properly, hypernatremia can lead to seizures, coma, and other complications.
8. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm: The patient has an accelerated idioventricular rhythm, which may be related to his medications or other underlying conditions. If not managed properly, this condition can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.

The patient's medical team should closely monitor his condition and manage these potential complications to prevent further deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-inch tall, 85.6 kg male who is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, and blood pressure of 131/77 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 322 K/uL. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 17 mg/dL.

The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 37 mmHg and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 45 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via a tracheostomy tube and is on a ventilator.

The patient's neurological status is impaired, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 and a pupillary response that is not assessed. The patient is also experiencing altered mental status, with a confusion and delirium.

The patient's medical history includes Lyme disease and Bell's palsy. The patient is receiving antibiotics for an unknown infection and is on a regimen of medications to prevent stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and the patient is at risk of developing respiratory failure if the underlying cause is not addressed.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function is impaired, and the patient is at risk of developing acute kidney injury if the underlying cause is not addressed.
3. Sepsis: The patient is receiving antibiotics for an unknown infection, and the patient is at risk of developing sepsis if the infection is not properly treated.
4. DVT: The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to immobility and the presence of central venous catheters.
5. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcers due to the presence of central venous catheters and the patient's compromised respiratory status.

In conclusion, the patient is a 70-inch tall, 85.6 kg male who is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, but the patient's laboratory results show impaired renal function and respiratory status. The patient's medical history includes Lyme disease and Bell's palsy, and the patient is receiving antibiotics for an unknown infection. Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, sepsis, DVT, and stress ulcers."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-inch tall, 85.6 kg male who is currently in the ICU. The patient has been admitted with respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis, and has been treated with seroquel, H2 blocker, and other medications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 96/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a cardiac index of 2.5 L/min/m², and a pulmonary artery occlusion pressure of 12 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.2 K/μL, a hematocrit of 30.9%, and a platelet count of 333 K/μL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L.

The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy mask and supplemental oxygen, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 234. The patient's arterial blood gas results show a pH of 7.43, a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 57 mmHg, and a partial pressure of oxygen of 117 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the patient's altered mental status and inability to cooperate. The patient's skin is pale, and the patient's peripheral pulses are not palpable.

The patient's diagnosis includes respiratory failure, acute, not ARDS, and altered mental status, not delirium. The patient's problems include impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired balance, impaired muscle performance, impaired respiration and gas exchange, impaired transfers, and alteration in elimination related to constipation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory support and supplemental oxygen may increase the risk of pneumonia.
3. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and impaired immune function may increase the risk of sepsis.
4. Constipation: The patient's altered bowel habits and impaired elimination may lead to constipation.
5. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility and altered mental status may increase the risk of pressure ulcers.
6. DVT: The patient's immobility and altered mental status may increase the risk of DVT.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's altered mental status and impaired gastric motility may increase the risk of stress ulcer.
8. VAP: The patient's respiratory support and supplemental oxygen may increase the risk of VAP."

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis s/p 4 week treatment course with ceftriaxone.  Now
   transferred with continued altered mental status and fevers.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to lyme encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Seroquel dose currently 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] (morning,
   afternoon), qhs 25mg; also 25 mg PRN agitation at night. Patient also
   required Haldol for agitation last night.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering. Today day #3 of 3 days at 5 TID, then
   will go to 3 days at 2.5 TID
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg; PRN 25mg for
   agitation at night
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been on trach collar since Sunday,
   tolerating well. CXR improved, making PNA less likely. Sputum cultures
   have been negative.  He has been on extended time period of  trach
   collar and does well with it. Respiratory acidosis and metabolic
   alkalosis. Patient most likely chronic COPD.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   -Will discuss with renal attending tomorrow
   - Will not give more acetazolamide at this time, but continue to
   monitor.
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, patient did have some of his episodes of
   hypotension immediately after seroquel evening dose.
   - Currently tapering clonodine
   - Clonodine taper: 0.1mg daily x3 days, done today
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   -Timing of meds: patient is getting many of his medications together,
   may be causing hypotensive periods. Touch base with nursing to ensure
   staggered timing of meds
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), then was
   afebrile for a while, but now having some low grade temps more recently
   ([**10-24**]). Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on
   due to transient hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with
   the idea that if he has a true infection, it would declare itself with
   elevated WBC
s and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, needs recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs specifically duration of eye drops and f/u as
   outpatient
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   -Recheck LFTs tomorrow
   #Hypernatremia (resolved): free water 250 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.
   FEN: correct/replete electrolytes, tube feeds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis s/p 4 week treatment course with ceftriaxone.  Now
   transferred with continued altered mental status and fevers.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to lyme encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Seroquel dose currently 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] (morning,
   afternoon), qhs 25mg; also 25 mg PRN agitation at night. Patient also
   required Haldol for agitation last night.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering. Today day #3 of 3 days at 5 TID, then
   will go to 3 days at 2.5 TID
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg; PRN 25mg for
   agitation at night
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been on trach collar since Sunday,
   tolerating well. CXR improved, making PNA less likely. Sputum cultures
   have been negative.  He has been on extended time period of  trach
   collar and does well with it. Respiratory acidosis and metabolic
   alkalosis. Patient most likely chronic COPD.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   -Will discuss with renal attending tomorrow
   - Will not give more acetazolamide at this time, but continue to
   monitor.
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, patient did have some of his episodes of
   hypotension immediately after seroquel evening dose.
   - Currently tapering clonodine
   - Clonodine taper: 0.1mg daily x3 days, done today
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   -Timing of meds: patient is getting many of his medications together,
   may be causing hypotensive periods. Touch base with nursing to ensure
   staggered timing of meds
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), then was
   afebrile for a while, but now having some low grade temps more recently
   ([**10-24**]). Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on
   due to transient hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with
   the idea that if he has a true infection, it would declare itself with
   elevated WBC
s and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, needs recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs specifically duration of eye drops and f/u as
   outpatient
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   -Recheck LFTs tomorrow
   #Hypernatremia (resolved): free water 250 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.
   FEN: correct/replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2B

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male admitted with neurologic changes and diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis. He has been treated with a 4-week course of ceftriaxone and is now experiencing altered mental status, agitation, and respiratory failure. He is also experiencing fever, hypotension, and electrolyte abnormalities.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, especially if his underlying chronic COPD is not well-managed.
2. Infection: Despite the patient's low-grade fever and negative cultures, there is a risk of ongoing infection, particularly given the patient's compromised immune system due to Lyme disease and the presence of multiple lines and tubes.
3. Neurological deterioration: The patient's altered mental status and agitation may worsen, potentially leading to increased risk of falls, respiratory failure, and other complications.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may recur, potentially leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
5. Electrolyte abnormalities: The patient's metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia may worsen, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or other complications.
6. Corneal ulcer: The patient's corneal ulcer may worsen, potentially leading to vision loss or other complications.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may recur, potentially leading to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or other complications.
8. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm: The patient's accelerated idioventricular rhythm may worsen, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias or other complications.

To mitigate these risks, the patient's care team should continue to monitor his vital signs, electrolyte levels, and respiratory status closely. The team should also consider adjusting his medications, including his antihypertensives, sedatives, and antibiotics, to minimize the risk of adverse effects. Additionally, the patient's nutritional needs should be closely monitored, and his glycemic control should be optimized to prevent hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia."

 LYME DISEASE
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis s/p 4 week treatment course with ceftriaxone.  Now
   transferred with continued altered mental status and fevers.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to lyme encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use.  He responds well to PRN haldol, but we will try to avoid chemical
   sedation and restraints with frequent re-orientation. Will try to
   minimize all medications. Seroquel dose currently 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] (morning,
   afternoon), qhs 25mg; also 25 mg PRN agitation at night. Patient also
   required Haldol for agitation last night.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues
   but will try to wean this off as not clear that pt is in pain and that
   he needs it. Currently tapering. Today day #3 of 3 days at 5 TID, then
   will go to 3 days at 2.5 TID
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg; PRN 25mg for
   agitation at night
   # Respiratory failure: CXR improved, making PNA less likely. Sputum
   cultures have been negative.  He has been on extended time period of
   trach collar and does well with it. Respiratory acidosis and metabolic
   alkalosis. Patient most likely chronic COPD.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   -Will discuss with renal attending tomorrow
   - Will not give more acetazolamide at this time, but continue to
   monitor.
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  Will try stopping some
   antihypertensives and see if this improves. D/c clonodine given that he
   is on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, patient did have some of his episodes of
   hypotension immediately after seroquel evening dose.
   - Currently tapering clonodine
   - Clonodine taper: 0.1mg daily x3 days, done today
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   -Timing of meds: patient is getting many of his medications together,
   may be causing hypotensive periods. Touch base with nursing to ensure
   staggered timing of meds
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3), then was
   afebrile for a while, but now having some low grade temps more recently
   ([**10-24**]). Was only on Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on
   due to transient hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with
   the idea that if he has a true infection, it would declare itself with
   elevated WBC
s and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All
   recent cultures negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis
   vs PNA but this has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear
   infectious source other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, needs recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   - vigamox and bacitracin ointment.
   - f/u ophthalmology recs specifically duration of eye drops and f/u as
   outpatient
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   - Continue to trend.  If he has fevers again, would further address
   -Recheck LFTs tomorrow
   #Hypernatremia (resolved): free water 250 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.
   FEN: correct/replete electrolytes, tube feeds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic COPD and is at risk of developing respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis may worsen if not managed properly.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's bicarbonate levels are elevated, and the source is unclear. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of this condition.
3. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension in the past and may experience it again. This could be related to the medications he is taking, including Seroquel and Haldol.
4. Fever: The patient has had low-grade temperatures, and it is unclear whether he has an underlying infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of his fever.
5. Corneal ulcer: The patient has a corneal ulcer that may be related to his neurologic deficits. Further management is needed to prevent further complications.
6. Elevated LFTs: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, and the cause is unclear. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of this condition.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels were elevated in the past, and it is unclear whether he is still at risk of developing this condition.
8. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm: The patient has had episodes of accelerated idioventricular rhythm, which may be related to his lyme disease. Further management is needed to prevent further complications.
9. Constipation: The patient has been experiencing constipation, which may be related to his medications or underlying medical condition.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continue inhaled medications for bronchospasm.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.
3. Continue to manage the patient's hypotension.
4. Monitor the patient's fever and determine the cause of it.
5. Continue to manage the patient's corneal ulcer.
6. Monitor the patient's liver function tests.
7. Continue to manage the patient's hypernatremia.
8. Continue to manage the patient's accelerated idioventricular rhythm.
9. Continue to manage the patient's constipation.

The patient's disposition is unclear, but it is mentioned that he will be transferred to a rehabilitation facility this week."

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis s/p 4 week treatment course with ceftriaxone.  Now
   transferred with continued altered mental status and fevers.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to Lyme encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use. Will try to minimize all medications. Seroquel dose currently 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **] (morning, afternoon), qhs 25mg; also 25 mg PRN agitation at night.
   Patient also required Haldol for agitation last night.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues,
   currently tapering due to sedation.  Today day #3 of 3 days at 5 TID,
   then will go to 3 days at 2.5 TID
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg; PRN 25mg for
   agitation at night
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been on trach collar since Sunday,
   tolerating well. CXR improved, making PNA less likely. Sputum cultures
   have been negative.  He has been on extended time period of  trach
   collar and does well with it. Respiratory acidosis and metabolic
   alkalosis. Patient most likely chronic COPD.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   - D/w renal attending, felt that it was likely related mostly to his
   respiratory acidosis
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  . D/c clonodine given that he is
   on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, appeared to be related to getting most of his
   medications together; medications were retimed and this along with
   taper of clonodine has resolved hypotension.
   - Currently tapering clonodine, 0.1mg daily x3 days, done today
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3). Was only on
   Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on due to transient
   hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with the idea that if
   he has a true infection, it would declare itself with elevated WBC
   and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All recent cultures
   negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA but this
   has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear infectious source
   other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophtho.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   -D/c vigamox
   -Per ophthomology patient should continue other eye drops until
   outpatient f/u, patient can follow up with ophthomologist at his rehab
   facility
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   #Hypernatremia (resolved): free water 300 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   -patient
s sodium should be maintained at exactly 140 if possible as
   this is where his mental status is best
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   have been negative.  He has been on extended time period of  trach
   collar and does well with it. Respiratory acidosis and metabolic
   alkalosis. Patient most likely chronic COPD.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   - D/w renal attending, felt that it was likely related mostly to his
   respiratory acidosis
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  . D/c clonodine given that he is
   on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, appeared to be related to getting most of his
   medications together; medications were retimed and this along with
   taper of clonodine has resolved hypotension.
   - Currently tapering clonodine, 0.1mg daily x3 days, done today
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3). Was only on
   Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on due to transient
   hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with the idea that if
   he has a true infection, it would declare itself with elevated WBC
   and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All recent cultures
   negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA but this
   has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear infectious source
   other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophtho.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   -D/c vigamox
   -Per ophthomology patient should continue other eye drops until

   facility
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   #Hypernatremia (resolved): free water 300 cc q4 hours with tube feeding

s sodium should be maintained at exactly 140 if possible as
   this is where his mental status is best

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, ITP, and chronic pain, admitted with neurologic changes and diagnosed with Lyme encephalitis after a 4-week treatment course with ceftriaxone. He is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), metabolic alkalosis, and altered mental status. The patient has been on a trach collar since Sunday, tolerating well, and has been on extended time period of trach collar and does well with it. He has also been experiencing hypotension, which has been resolved with IV fluids and medication changes. The patient has a history of chronic pain and is currently tapering off methadone.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis may worsen if not managed properly.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The source of the metabolic alkalosis is unclear, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
3. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypotension may recur if not managed properly.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may worsen if not managed properly.
5. Fevers: The patient's low-grade fevers may indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be further evaluated.
6. Corneal ulcer: The patient's corneal ulcer may worsen if not properly managed.
7. Elevated LFTs: The patient's elevated LFTs may indicate liver damage, which needs to be further evaluated.
8. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may worsen if not managed properly.
9. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm: The patient's accelerated idioventricular rhythm may worsen if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as needed.
2. Further evaluate the cause of the metabolic alkalosis and manage accordingly.
3. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust therapy as needed to prevent hypotension.
4. Continue to manage the patient's altered mental status and adjust therapy as needed.
5. Further evaluate the cause of the patient's fevers and manage accordingly.
6. Continue to manage the patient's corneal ulcer and adjust therapy as needed.
7. Further evaluate the cause of the patient's elevated LFTs and manage accordingly.
8. Monitor the patient's sodium levels and adjust therapy as needed to prevent hypernatremia.
9. Continue to manage the patient's accelerated idioventricular rhythm and adjust therapy as needed.

ICU Care:

1. Nutrition: The patient should receive adequate nutrition to support his metabolic needs.
2. Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels should be monitored and managed to prevent hyperglycemia.
3. Lines: The patient's lines should be monitored and managed to prevent infection.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient should receive prophylactic anticoagulation therapy to prevent DVT.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient should receive stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. VAP: The patient should receive VAP prophylaxis to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.
7. Comments: The patient's code status should be reviewed and updated as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis s/p 4 week treatment course with ceftriaxone.  Now
   transferred with continued altered mental status and fevers.
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to Lyme encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use. Will try to minimize all medications. Seroquel dose currently 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **] (morning, afternoon), qhs 25mg; also 25 mg PRN agitation at night.
   Patient also required Haldol for agitation last night.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues,
   currently tapering due to sedation.  Today day #3 of 3 days at 5 TID,
   then will go to 3 days at 2.5 TID
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg; PRN 25mg for
   agitation at night
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been on trach collar since Sunday,
   tolerating well. CXR improved, making PNA less likely. Sputum cultures
   have been negative.  He has been on extended time period of  trach
   collar and does well with it. Respiratory acidosis and metabolic
   alkalosis. Patient most likely chronic COPD.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   - D/w renal attending, felt that it was likely related mostly to his
   respiratory acidosis
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  . D/c clonodine given that he is
   on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, appeared to be related to getting most of his
   medications together; medications were retimed and this along with
   taper of clonodine has resolved hypotension.
   - Currently tapering clonodine, 0.1mg daily x3 days, done today
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3). Was only on
   Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on due to transient
   hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with the idea that if
   he has a true infection, it would declare itself with elevated WBC
   and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All recent cultures
   negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA but this
   has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear infectious source
   other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophthal.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   -D/c vigamox
   -Per ophthomology patient should continue other eye drops until
   outpatient f/u, patient can follow up with ophthomologist at his rehab
   facility
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   #Hypernatremia (resolved): free water 300 cc q4 hours with tube feeding
   -patient
s sodium should be maintained at exactly 140 if possible as
   this is where his mental status is best
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.
   FEN: correct/replete electrolytes, tube feeds

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient, a 63-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, fever, and respiratory failure. He has a history of hypertension, intrathoracic pain, and has been treated for Lyme encephalitis with ceftriaxone. The patient is currently on seroquel for agitation, and his mental status is impaired. He has been experiencing respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis, and his respiratory failure is likely related to chronic COPD.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC count: 8.2-8.6 K/uL
* Hct: 30.9-34.4%
* Plt: 333-333 K/uL
* Cr: 0.5-0.7 mg/dL
* TCO2: 45-39 mmHg
* Glucose: 140-146 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.5 g/dL
* LDH: 172 IU/L
* Ca++: 9.0 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.4 mg/dL
* PO4: 4.9 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Right eye closed
* Right toe ulceration improving
* Soft, non-pulsatile, and non-tender abdomen

The patient's vital signs are:

* Tcurrent: 35.9°C (96.7°F)
* HR: 101 bpm
* BP: 96/61 mmHg
* RR: 10 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 96%

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely related to chronic COPD, and he may require continued respiratory support.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis is unresolved, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
3. Electrolyte abnormalities: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and further monitoring is needed to prevent complications.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be related to delirium, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
5. Infection: The patient's fever and low-grade temperatures may indicate an underlying infection, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
6. Corneal ulcer: The patient's corneal ulcer may be related to his neurologic deficits, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
7. Elevated LFTs: The patient's elevated LFTs are unresolved, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
8. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is resolved, but further monitoring is needed to prevent recurrence.
9. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm: The patient's accelerated idioventricular rhythm is unresolved, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.

Based on the patient's condition, I recommend the following:

1. Continue respiratory support as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and correct any abnormalities.
3. Further evaluate the patient's altered mental status to determine the cause.
4. Monitor the patient's temperature and evaluate for any signs of infection.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's corneal ulcer and provide further evaluation as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's LFTs and evaluate for any signs of liver dysfunction.
7. Monitor the patient's sodium levels and provide further evaluation as needed to prevent hypernatremia.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's accelerated idioventricular rhythm and evaluate for any signs of cardiac dysfunction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with neurologic changes and a diagnosis of Lyme encephalitis. He has been treated with ceftriaxone for four weeks and has been transferred to the ICU with continued altered mental status and fevers. The patient has a history of hypertension, ITP, and chronic pain control issues. He is currently on Seroquel for agitation and Haldol for agitation at night.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, and blood pressure of 96/61 mmHg. His respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 96% on a trach mask. His laboratory results show respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis, with a bicarbonate level of 45 mmol/L.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been on a trach collar since Sunday and has been tolerating it well. His CXR has improved, and sputum cultures have been negative.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's bicarbonate level is normalized, and his urine chloride is normal, suggesting he is not volume depleted.
3. Hypotension: The patient has previously had periods of hypotension, which responded to IV fluids and antibiotics.
4. Fever: The patient has had daily low-grade temperatures, which have been attributed to his underlying infection.
5. Corneal ulcer: The patient has a corneal ulcer, which is likely related to his inability to protect his eye due to his neurologic deficits.
6. Elevated LFTs: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, but have normalized. The etiology is unclear.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated, which has been managed with free water and tube feeds.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue inhaled medications for bronchospasm.
2. Monitor his respiratory status and adjust his trach collar as needed.
3. Manage his metabolic alkalosis with electrolyte repletion and tube feeds.
4. Continue his antibiotics for Lyme disease.
5. Monitor his liver function tests and adjust his medications as needed.
6. Manage his hypernatremia with free water and tube feeds.
7. Provide wound care for his corneal ulcer.

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status could deteriorate, requiring increased oxygen therapy or intubation.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's bicarbonate level could continue to rise, requiring further management.
3. Hypotension: The patient could experience another episode of hypotension, requiring further management.
4. Fever: The patient's fever could continue to rise, requiring further investigation and treatment.
5. Corneal ulcer: The patient's corneal ulcer could become infected, requiring further management.
6. Elevated LFTs: The patient's liver function tests could continue to be elevated, requiring further investigation and treatment.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level could continue to rise, requiring further management."

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis s/p 4 week treatment course with ceftriaxone.  Now
   transferred with continued altered mental status and fevers.
   #Bloody bowel movement: Patient does appear to have some abdominal pain
   this morning in the setting of his bloody bowel movements, unclear as
   he is a poor historian. Pt having NABS. Has had 5 point drop in HCT.
   Per report, blood seems more like hemorrhoidal bleeding, but this
   should not give pain.
   -KUB in setting of pain to assess for free air
   -Pt has active T&S, 2 peripheral large bore IVs
   -q4 HCT
   -GI consult
   #[**Last Name (un) **] pain: unclear if patient is having pain due to poor history.
   -Lactate
   -LFTs, lipase
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to Lyme encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use. Will try to minimize all medications. Seroquel dose currently 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **] (morning, afternoon), qhs 25mg; also 25 mg PRN agitation at night.
   Patient also required Haldol for agitation last night.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues,
   currently tapering due to sedation.  Today day #1 of 3 days at 2.5 TID
   (after this done with methadone)
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg; PRN 25mg for
   agitation at night
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been on trach collar since Sunday,
   tolerating well. CXR improved, making PNA less likely. Sputum cultures
   have been negative.  He has been on extended time period of  trach
   collar and does well with it. Respiratory acidosis and metabolic
   alkalosis. Patient most likely chronic COPD.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   - D/w renal attending, felt that it was likely related mostly to his
   respiratory acidosis
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  . D/c clonodine given that he is
   on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, appeared to be related to getting most of his
   medications together; medications were retimed and this along with
   taper of clonodine has resolved hypotension.
   - Currently tapering clonodine, 0.1mg daily x3 days, done today
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3). Was only on
   Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on due to transient
   hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with the idea that if
   he has a true infection, it would declare itself with elevated WBC
   and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All recent cultures
   negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA but this
   has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear infectious source
   other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophtho.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   -D/c vigamox
   -Per ophthomology patient should continue other eye drops until
   outpatient f/u, patient can follow up with ophthomologist at his rehab
   facility
   # Elevated LFTs.  Normalized.  Unclear etiology, possibly due to
   ceftriaxone.
   #Hypernatremia free water 300 cc q4 hours with tube feeding; pt
   receiving 2 L D5W currently. Recheck Na+ in evening
   -patient
s sodium should be maintained at exactly 140 if possible as
   this is where his mental status is best
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis require close monitoring, and the patient's chronic COPD may worsen if not managed properly.
2. Bleeding: The patient's bloody bowel movements and recent drop in HCT (hematocrit) indicate a potential bleeding disorder. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and prevent further bleeding.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypernatremia and metabolic alkalosis require careful management to prevent further complications.
4. Infection: The patient's low-grade fever and recent antibiotic use suggest a potential infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and prevent antibiotic resistance.
5. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and agitation may be due to Lyme encephalitis, electrolyte imbalance, or medication side effects. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's bloody bowel movements and recent drop in HCT indicate a potential gastrointestinal bleeding disorder. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and prevent further bleeding.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's recent drop in platelet count (262 K/uL) suggests a potential bleeding disorder. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and prevent further bleeding.
8. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's elevated LFTs (liver function tests) may indicate liver dysfunction. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and prevent further complications.
9. Renal dysfunction: The patient's metabolic alkalosis and recent drop in HCT suggest a potential renal dysfunction. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and prevent further complications.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following assessments and plans are necessary:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Investigate the cause of the patient's bleeding and bleeding disorder, and provide appropriate treatment and management.
3. Manage the patient's electrolyte imbalance and metabolic alkalosis with careful monitoring and treatment.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's infection status and provide appropriate antibiotic treatment if necessary.
5. Manage the patient's delirium and agitation with close monitoring and treatment.
6. Investigate the cause of the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and provide appropriate treatment and management.
7. Monitor the patient's platelet count and provide platelet transfusions as necessary.
8. Investigate the cause of the patient's hepatic dysfunction and provide appropriate treatment and management.
9. Monitor the patient's renal status and provide appropriate treatment and management if necessary.

The patient's code status is full code, and the patient's disposition is to be transferred to the floor for further rehabilitation when a bed becomes available."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 70-inch tall, 85.6 kg male who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical issues. He has a history of hypernatremia, and his current sodium level is 127 mg/dL. He has also had a large bloody bowel movement, which has been type and crossed for possible transfusion. His hemoglobin level is 9.9 g/dL, and his platelet count is 262 K/uL. He has a history of constipation, and his current bowel movement is dark and bloody. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, and blood pressure of 113/68 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypernatremia: The patient's current sodium level is 127 mg/dL, which is higher than the normal range. This could lead to complications such as seizures, coma, and even death if left untreated.
2. Constipation: The patient's history of constipation and current bowel movement could lead to complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, and infection.
3. Hemorrhage: The patient's large bloody bowel movement could lead to complications such as hemorrhagic shock, anemia, and coagulopathy.
4. Infection: The patient's current condition could lead to complications such as sepsis, pneumonia, and wound infection.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory status could lead to complications such as respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory arrest.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's current neurological status could lead to complications such as seizures, stroke, and neurological deficits.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's current cardiovascular status could lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's current gastrointestinal status could lead to complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, and obstruction.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's current condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. The patient's hypernatremia, constipation, and hemorrhage need to be addressed promptly. The patient's respiratory status needs to be closely monitored, and oxygen therapy should be continued as needed. The patient's neurological and cardiovascular status also need to be closely monitored, and any changes should be reported promptly.

The patient's code status is full code, which means that all measures should be taken to save his life. The patient's disposition is still pending, but he will likely require further treatment and management in the ICU."

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis s/p 4 week treatment course with ceftriaxone.  Now
   transferred with continued altered mental status and fevers.
   #[**Last Name (un) **] pain: patient in pain this morning when examined on prerounds;
   received 2mg IV morphine and was seen by surgery, at that point no
   longer in pain. Per his report pain was in the RUQ. Possible etiologies
   of pain in RUQ that resolves include biliary colic, ulcer disease;
   could also be MI. Lactate normal making ischemia less of a concern.
   Patient may have acalculous cholecystitis in the setting of ceftriaxone
   use for 28 days.
   -LFTs, lipase
   -RUQ ultrasound
   -EKG
   -Serial troponins x 3
   -IV PPI
   #Bloody bowel movement: Patient does appear to have some abdominal pain
   this morning in the setting of his bloody bowel movements, unclear as
   he is a poor historian. Pt having NABS. Has had 5 point drop in HCT.
   Per report, blood seems more like hemorrhoidal bleeding, but this
   should not give pain. Patient may also have bleeding related to ulcer.
   -PEG tube lavage to assess for UGI bleed.
   -Pt has active T&S, 2 peripheral large bore IVs
   -q6 HCT
   -GI consult  for possible EGD and [**Last Name (un) **]
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to Lyme encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use. Will try to minimize all medications. Seroquel dose currently 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **] (morning, afternoon), qhs 25mg; also 25 mg PRN agitation at night.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues,
   currently tapering due to sedation.  Today day #1 of 3 days at 2.5 TID
   (after this done with methadone)
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg; PRN 25mg for
   agitation at night
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been on trach collar since Sunday,
   tolerating well. CXR improved, making PNA less likely. Sputum cultures
   have been negative.  Respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.
   Patient most likely chronic COPD.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   #Hypernatremia free water 300 cc q4 hours with tube feeding; pt
   receiving 2 L D5W currently. Recheck Na+ in evening
   -patient
s sodium should be maintained at exactly 140 if possible as
   this is where his mental status is best
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  . D/c clonodine given that he is
   on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, appeared to be related to getting most of his
   medications together; medications were retimed and this along with
   taper of clonodine has resolved hypotension.
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3). Was only on
   Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on due to transient
   hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with the idea that if
   he has a true infection, it would declare itself with elevated WBC
   and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All recent cultures
   negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA but this
   has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear infectious source
   other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophtho.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   -Per ophthomology patient should continue other eye drops until
   outpatient f/u, patient can follow up with ophthomologist at his rehab
   facility
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   transferred with continued altered mental status and fevers.
   #[**Last Name (un) **] pain: patient in pain this morning when examined on prerounds;
   received 2mg IV morphine and was seen by surgery, at that point no
   longer in pain. Per his report pain was in the RUQ. Possible etiologies
   of pain in RUQ that resolves include biliary colic, ulcer disease;
   could also be MI. Lactate normal making ischemia less of a concern.
   Patient may have acalculous cholecystitis in the setting of ceftriaxone
   use for 28 days.
   -LFTs, lipase
   -RUQ ultrasound
   -EKG
   -Serial troponins x 3
   -IV PPI
   #Bloody bowel movement: Patient does appear to have some abdominal pain
   this morning in the setting of his bloody bowel movements, unclear as
   he is a poor historian. Pt having NABS. Has had 5 point drop in HCT.
   Per report, blood seems more like hemorrhoidal bleeding, but this
   should not give pain. Patient may also have bleeding related to ulcer.
   -PEG tube lavage to assess for UGI bleed.
   -Pt has active T&S, 2 peripheral large bore IVs
   -q6 HCT
   -GI consult  for possible EGD and [**Last Name (un) **]
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to Lyme encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use. Will try to minimize all medications. Seroquel dose currently 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **] (morning, afternoon), qhs 25mg; also 25 mg PRN agitation at night.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues,
   currently tapering due to sedation.  Today day #1 of 3 days at 2.5 TID
   (after this done with methadone)
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg; PRN 25mg for
   agitation at night
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been on trach collar since Sunday,
   tolerating well. CXR improved, making PNA less likely. Sputum cultures
   have been negative.  Respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.
   Patient most likely chronic COPD.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   #Hypernatremia free water 300 cc q4 hours with tube feeding; pt
   receiving 2 L D5W currently. Recheck Na+ in evening
   -patient
s sodium should be maintained at exactly 140 if possible as
   this is where his mental status is best
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  . D/c clonodine given that he is
   on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, appeared to be related to getting most of his
   medications together; medications were retimed and this along with
   taper of clonodine has resolved hypotension.
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3). Was only on
   Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on due to transient
   hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with the idea that if
   he has a true infection, it would declare itself with elevated WBC
   and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All recent cultures
   negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA but this
   has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear infectious source
   other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophtho.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   -Per ophthomology patient should continue other eye drops until
   outpatient f/u, patient can follow up with ophthomologist at his rehab
   facility
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and Lyme encephalitis. He was admitted with neurologic changes and fevers, and is currently being treated for respiratory failure, metabolic alkalosis, and hypernatremia.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including:

1. Agitation and altered mental status, likely due to Lyme encephalitis, electrolyte abnormalities, and medication-related effects.
2. Bloody bowel movements, which may be related to hemorrhoidal bleeding, ulcer disease, or acalculous cholecystitis.
3. Respiratory failure, which is likely chronic COPD-related, although the patient has no clear history of COPD.
4. Metabolic alkalosis, which is unclear in origin, but not related to hypokalemia.
5. Hypernatremia, which is being treated with free water and tube feeding.
6. Hypotension, which has resolved with IV fluids and medication adjustments.
7. Fever, which has been present for several days and is not clearly related to an infectious source.
8. Corneal ulcer, which is likely related to the patient's neurologic deficits and inability to protect his eye.
9. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm, which is thought to be benign and not related to Lyme disease.

The patient's medical complications and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory decline and may require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Bleeding: The patient's bloody bowel movements and possible bleeding related to ulcer disease or acalculous cholecystitis increase his risk for bleeding complications.
3. Infection: The patient's low-grade fever and negative cultures suggest that he may still have an underlying infection, which could worsen his condition.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypernatremia and metabolic alkalosis increase his risk for further electrolyte imbalances, which could affect his mental status and cardiovascular stability.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's history of accelerated idioventricular rhythm and hypotension increase his risk for further cardiovascular instability.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued respiratory support with a trach collar and inhaled medications.
2. Monitoring of electrolyte levels and management of hypernatremia and metabolic alkalosis.
3. Further evaluation of the patient's bloody bowel movements, including PEG tube lavage and possible EGD.
4. Continued treatment for respiratory failure, including bronchodilators and oxygen therapy.
5. Monitoring of the patient's cardiovascular stability and management of any further episodes of hypotension or tachycardia.
6. Further evaluation of the patient's fever, including recultures and possible antibiotic therapy.
7. Continued management of the patient's corneal ulcer, including eye drops and follow-up with an ophthalmologist.
8. Monitoring of the patient's mental status and management of any further episodes of agitation or altered mental status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis s/p 4 week treatment course with ceftriaxone.  Now
   transferred with continued altered mental status and fevers.
   #[**Last Name (un) **] pain: patient
s pain has resolved. [**Month (only) 11**] have been related to
   constipation given amount of stool in colon. LFTs normal, RUQ
   ultrasound normal, EKG unchanged. Will restart tube feeds and monitor.
   Bowel regimen.
   #Bloody bowel movement: Patient no longer having bloody bowel
   movements, HCT has actually returned to baseline without transfusion.
   PEG tube lavage negative. GI did not do scope as bleeding had stopped.
   -Pt has active T&S, 2 peripheral large bore IVs
   - PO PPI
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to Lyme encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use. Will try to minimize all medications. Seroquel dose currently 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **] (morning, afternoon), qhs 25mg; also 25 mg PRN agitation at night.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues,
   currently tapering due to sedation.  Today day #2 of 3 days at 2.5 TID
   (after this done with methadone)
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg; PRN 25mg for
   agitation at night
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been on trach collar since Sunday,
   tolerating well. CXR improved, making PNA less likely. Sputum cultures
   have been negative.  Respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.
   Patient most likely chronic COPD.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   #Hypernatremia free water 300 cc q4 hours with tube feeding. Recheck
   Na+ in evening. Patient
s sodium dropped dramatically with stopping of
   tube feeds, will need to check salt content of tube feeds.
   -patient
s sodium should be maintained at exactly 140 if possible as
   this is where his mental status is best
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  . D/c clonodine given that he is
   on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, appeared to be related to getting most of his
   medications together; medications were retimed and this along with
   taper of clonodine has resolved hypotension.
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3). Was only on
   Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on due to transient
   hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with the idea that if
   he has a true infection, it would declare itself with elevated WBC
   and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All recent cultures
   negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA but this
   has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear infectious source
   other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophtho.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   -Per ophthomology patient should continue other eye drops until
   outpatient f/u, patient can follow up with ophthomologist at his rehab
   facility
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, ITP, and Lyme disease, admitted to the ICU with neurologic changes and fevers. He has been treated with ceftriaxone for Lyme encephalitis and has been experiencing altered mental status, constipation, and respiratory failure. He has a history of chronic pain and is currently on methadone and seroquel for pain control. He has also been experiencing hypotension, fever, and corneal ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to chronic COPD and acute respiratory acidosis. He may require continued mechanical ventilation and treatment with bronchodilators.
2. Constipation: The patient's constipation is likely due to his underlying medical conditions and medications. He may require bowel regimen and treatment with laxatives.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to his underlying medical conditions, including Lyme encephalitis, and may require treatment with antipsychotics and sedatives.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to his underlying medical conditions, medications, and dehydration. He may require treatment with fluids and vasopressors.
5. Fever: The patient's fever may be due to an underlying infection, including Lyme disease. He may require treatment with antibiotics and antifungals.
6. Corneal Ulcer: The patient's corneal ulcer may require treatment with antibiotics and antivirals, and he may require follow-up with an ophthalmologist.
7. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm: The patient's accelerated idioventricular rhythm may require treatment with medications and may be related to his underlying medical conditions.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and treatment to manage his various medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2102-10-26**] 03:45 PM
   - Had some RUQ transient abdominal pain that was resolved by time of
   rounds. Made NPO/stopped TF's. Lactate 1.3
   - LFT's added on: all normal
   - 1130am labs Hct 29.1 --> 30.2, CE's negative --> 6pm labs with Na
   134, Hct 32.4
   - KUB showing lots of stool. Significant fecal loading in ascending,
   transverse and descending colon, no evidence of small or large bowel
   obstruction
   - RUQ u/s showing apparently normal liver & gallbladder (limited exam)

   guaiac positive, a lot of stool in vault but no obvious hemorrhoids,
   fissures, defects, etc.
   - Did Gtube lavage x2 without any blood, only returned clear water
   - EKG was unchanged from previous

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Bells Palsy
   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis s/p 4 week treatment course with ceftriaxone.  Now
   transferred with continued altered mental status and fevers.
   #[**Last Name (un) **] pain: patient
s pain has resolved. [**Month (only) 11**] have been related to
   constipation given amount of stool in colon. LFTs normal, RUQ
   ultrasound normal, EKG unchanged. Will restart tube feeds and monitor.
   Bowel regimen.
   #Bloody bowel movement: Patient no longer having bloody bowel
   movements, HCT has actually returned to baseline without transfusion.
   PEG tube lavage negative, upper source for GI bleeding exceedingly
   unlikely. Patient does not require PPI. GI did not do scope as bleeding
   had stopped.
   -Pt has active T&S
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to Lyme encephalitis,
   though could be multifactorial - electrolyte abnormalities, other
   concurrent infection, med related.  Also with some chronic narcotic
   use. Will try to minimize all medications. Seroquel dose currently 12.5
   [**Hospital1 **] (morning, afternoon), qhs 25mg; also 25 mg PRN agitation at night.
   - Pt has been on Methadone 10 mg TID for chronic pain control issues,
   currently tapering due to sedation.  Today day #2 of 3 days at 2.5 TID
   (after this done with methadone)
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg; PRN 25mg for
   agitation at night
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been on trach collar since Sunday,
   tolerating well. CXR improved, making PNA less likely. Sputum cultures
   have been negative.  Respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.
   Patient most likely chronic COPD.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   #Hypernatremia free water 300 cc q4 hours with tube feeding. Recheck
   Na+ in evening. Patient
s sodium dropped dramatically with stopping of
   tube feeds, will need to check salt content of tube feeds.
   -patient
s sodium should be maintained at exactly 140 if possible as
   this is where his mental status is best
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  . D/c clonodine given that he is
   on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, appeared to be related to getting most of his
   medications together; medications were retimed and this along with
   taper of clonodine has resolved hypotension.
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3). Was only on
   Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on due to transient
   hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with the idea that if
   he has a true infection, it would declare itself with elevated WBC
   and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All recent cultures
   negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA but this
   has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear infectious source
   other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophtho.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   -Per ophthomology patient should continue other eye drops until
   outpatient f/u, patient can follow up with ophthomologist at his rehab
   facility
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been on a trach collar since Sunday and has respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis. He may require further respiratory support and monitoring.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's bicarbonate level is elevated, and the source is unclear. This may require further investigation and treatment.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated, and he requires close monitoring and management to maintain a safe level.
4. Constipation: The patient has significant fecal loading in his colon, which may lead to further complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
5. Altered mental status: The patient has impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, which may be related to Lyme encephalitis, electrolyte abnormalities, or other concurrent infections.
6. Fever: The patient has had daily low-grade temperatures, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause.
7. Corneal ulcer: The patient has a corneal ulcer, likely related to his neurologic deficits, which requires close monitoring and management.
8. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm: The patient has had an accelerated idioventricular rhythm, which may require further investigation and treatment.

The patient's medical history includes Lyme disease, hypertension, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). He has been treated with ceftriaxone and has a pending Vitamin B12 level. His current medications include Seroquel, Methadone, and metoprolol.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 7.6-10.9
* Hct: 29.1-32.4

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition is as follows:

* The patient experienced transient abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) that resolved on its own.
* Laboratory results show elevated lactate levels (1.3 mmol/L), and hemoglobin (Hct) levels have increased from 29.1% to 32.4%.
* The patient has significant fecal loading in the ascending, transverse, and descending colon, with no evidence of small or large bowel obstruction.
* The patient has a guaiac-positive stool, but no gross blood or other abnormalities were found on digital rectal examination (DRE).
* The patient has been managed conservatively with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and has been advised to take Vitamin B12 supplements.
* The patient has a history of confusion and delirium, but the current mental status is altered, not delirious.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:

* Constipation-related elimination alterations
* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
* Impaired muscle performance and impaired transfers
* Impaired balance and impaired cognitive function
* Potential for further gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation
* Risk of sepsis or infection due to fecal loading and potential for bowel perforation

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to assess the progression of their condition and adjust treatment accordingly."

   63M with HTN, ITP, admitted with neurologic changes and found to have
   lyme encephalitis s/p 4 week treatment course with ceftriaxone.  Now
   transferred with continued altered mental status and fevers.
   #[**Last Name (un) **] pain: patient in pain this morning when examined on prerounds;
   received 2mg IV morphine and was seen by surgery, at that point no
   longer in pain. Per his report pain was in the RUQ. Possible etiologies
   of pain in RUQ that resolves include biliary colic, ulcer disease;
   could also be MI. Lactate normal making ischemia less of a concern.
   Patient may have acalculous cholecystitis in the setting of ceftriaxone
   use for 28 days.
   -LFTs, lipase
   -RUQ ultrasound
   -EKG
   -Serial troponins x 3
   -IV PPI
   #Bloody bowel movement: Patient does appear to have some abdominal pain
   this morning in the setting of his bloody bowel movements, unclear as
   he is a poor historian. Pt having NABS. Has had 5 point drop in HCT.
   Per report, blood seems more like hemorrhoidal bleeding, but this
   should not give pain. Patient may also have bleeding related to ulcer.
   -PEG tube lavage to assess for UGI bleed.
   -Pt has active T&S, 2 peripheral large bore IVs
   -q6 HCT
   -GI consult  for possible EGD and [**Last Name (un) **]
   # Agitation/altered mental status. Primarily due to Lyme encephalitis,

   (after this done with methadone)
   - Currently on Seroquel 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with hs dose 25mg; PRN 25mg for
   agitation at night
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been on trach collar since Sunday,
   tolerating well. CXR improved, making PNA less likely. Sputum cultures
   have been negative.  Respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.
   Patient most likely chronic COPD.
   - Continue inhaled meds as prior for bronchospasm (no clear history of
   COPD, though with significant smoking history).
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb normalized. Urine chloride was normal,
   suggesting he is not volume depleted. Not related to hypokalemia as K+
   is normal. Unclear source.
   #Hypernatremia free water 300 cc q4 hours with tube feeding; pt
   receiving 2 L D5W currently. Recheck Na+ in evening
   -patient
s sodium should be maintained at exactly 140 if possible as
   this is where his mental status is best
   # Hypotension (resolved): Has previously had periods of hypotension
   with SBPs to 80s.  Responded to IV fluids and started on vanc, cefepime
   and cipro for a presumed hospital acquired pneumonia (had had CXR that
   showed possible new RLL infiltrates).  . D/c clonodine given that he is
   on metoprolol for control of HR after an accelerated idioventricular
   rhythm. Per nursing, appeared to be related to getting most of his
   medications together; medications were retimed and this along with
   taper of clonodine has resolved hypotension.
   - He had had a cards consult for tachycardia, which they felt was an
   accelerated idioventricular rhythm, given metoprolol for this.
   # Fever.  Daily low grade temps [**Date range (1) 9233**] (100-100.3). Was only on
   Ceftriaxone, but several more ABx
s were added on due to transient
   hypotense episodes, and then they were pulled off with the idea that if
   he has a true infection, it would declare itself with elevated WBC
   and high fevers. His WBC count still remains low. All recent cultures
   negative. CXR bilateral base opacification, atelectasis vs PNA but this
   has been present for several previous CXR
s. No clear infectious source
   other than the IgM Lyme.
   - If febrile again, recultures of everything
   - Hold off on starting any ABx for now
   # Corneal ulcer.  s/p eyelid suturing with ophtho.  Likely related to
   inability to protect eye with neurologic deficits.
   -Per ophthomology patient should continue other eye drops until
   outpatient f/u, patient can follow up with ophthomologist at his rehab
   facility
   # Accelerated idioventricular rhythm.  Cards saw; thought benign and
   not related to lyme disease.
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 63-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, fevers, and respiratory failure. He has a history of Lyme encephalitis, hypertension, and immune thrombocytopenia. He is currently receiving treatment for Lyme disease, but his mental status remains impaired. He has been experiencing abdominal pain, bloody stools, and constipation. His laboratory results show a low white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal pain, bloody stools, and constipation may indicate a gastrointestinal infection or inflammatory condition.
3. Infection: The patient's fevers and low white blood cell count may indicate a bacterial or viral infection.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypokalemia and hypernatremia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's impaired mental status and altered mental status may worsen, leading to seizures, coma, or other neurological complications.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's bloody stools and constipation may indicate a bleeding disorder or gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Inflammatory response: The patient's elevated lactate levels and abnormal liver function tests may indicate an inflammatory response, which may worsen his condition.

Plan:

1. Continue treatment for Lyme disease.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as needed.
3. Manage the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms with medications and fluids.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust therapy as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust therapy as needed.
6. Consider further diagnostic testing, such as a colonoscopy or upper GI endoscopy, to evaluate the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms.
7. Consider antibiotics for the patient's fevers and low white blood cell count.
8. Monitor the patient's bleeding status and adjust therapy as needed.
9. Consider further diagnostic testing, such as a CT scan or MRI, to evaluate the patient's neurological symptoms.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's condition and adjust therapy as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man admitted to the ICU with Lyme encephalitis, acute abdominal pain, and respiratory failure. The patient's abdominal pain has resolved, and imaging studies are reassuring. He is still experiencing encephalopathy and delirium, with a differential diagnosis including Lyme encephalitis, medication effects, general illness, and a combination of above.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 122/60 mmHg. His respiratory status is also stable, with an oxygen saturation of 98% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery. His physical examination is notable for facial droop, stable eye findings, and decreased breath sounds at the right base.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 343 K/uL. His electrolyte levels are normal, except for hypernatremia, which is being repleted with free water. His liver function tests are mildly elevated, and his renal function tests are normal.

The patient's medical plan includes complete tapering of methadone and clonidine, continuation of seroquel, and repletion of free water for hypernatremia. He is also receiving respiratory support with a tracheostomy, and his corneal ulcer is being treated with antibiotic ointment.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he may still be at risk for respiratory failure due to his underlying lung disease.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his immunocompromised state and the presence of a tracheostomy.
3. Delirium: The patient's encephalopathy and delirium may worsen, leading to increased agitation and difficulty with care.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may worsen, leading to seizures, coma, or other complications.
5. Corneal ulcer: The patient's corneal ulcer may worsen, leading to vision loss or other complications.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but he requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."
