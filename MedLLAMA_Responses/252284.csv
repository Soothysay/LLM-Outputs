   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 76 year old male with history of AS/AI, HTN s/p L hip
   revision on [**3-8**] who developed chest pain today found to have NSTEMI 48
   hrs after L hip revision ([**3-8**]), transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further
   workup.
   .
   #. CAD: Patient developed chest pain in peri-operative setting (48hrs
   out) and found to have positive cardiac markers.  Patient has known AS
   so MI possibly demand in this setting.  He was also noted to be anemic
   post-operatively.  Risk factors include hypertension.  Currently chest
   pain free.  EKG with LBBB which is old, difficult to assess.  Telemetry
   also demonstrated some NSVT since arrival.
   - Continue with heparin gtt which was started at OSH.
   - Start integrillin gtt with bolus given large CK leak and prolonged
   symptoms.
   - Continue beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated to goal HR 60-70s.
   - Aspirin, plavix load
   - Continue to cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Follow hct as patient is s/p hip surgery
   - Repeat EKG in the AM.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male who underwent left hip revision surgery on March 8th and developed chest pain 48 hours later, which was found to be a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and hypertension.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is 125/57 mmHg, and his heart rate is 83 beats per minute. His oxygen saturation is 96% on nasal cannula.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen via nasal cannula.
* Cardiac enzymes: Troponin-T is 0.49 ng/mL, and CK-MB is 1098 U/L.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 10.7 K/uL, hemoglobin is 9.0 g/dL, and platelet count is 194 K/uL.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's NSTEMI may lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock.
2. Pulmonary complications: The patient's respiratory support and oxygen therapy may lead to respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's age and medical history may increase his risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of hip surgery and prolonged hospitalization may increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation or ileus.
5. Infection: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and invasive medical devices may increase his risk of infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or central line-associated bloodstream infection.
6. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's history of hip surgery and prolonged immobility may increase his risk of venous thromboembolism.
7. Kidney injury: The patient's age, medical history, and prolonged hospitalization may increase his risk of kidney injury or acute kidney injury.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing heparin infusion and integrillin infusion to prevent thrombosis and further cardiac complications.
* Starting aspirin and clopidogrel to prevent further cardiac complications.
* Titrating beta blocker to achieve a heart rate of 60-70 beats per minute.
* Monitoring cardiac enzymes and troponin levels to assess cardiac function.
* Repeating echocardiogram on Monday to assess cardiac function.
* Monitoring for signs of cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock.
* Providing pain control and management of the patient's hip wound.
* Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, tachycardia, or leukocytosis.
* Providing nutrition and glycemic control to prevent malnutrition and hyperglycemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 76 year old male with history of AS/AI, HTN s/p L hip
   revision on [**3-8**] who developed chest pain today found to have NSTEMI 48
   hrs after L hip revision ([**3-8**]), transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further
   workup.  Has remained chest pain free since admission.
   .
   #. CAD: Patient developed chest pain in peri-operative setting (48hrs
   out) and found to have positive cardiac markers.  Patient has known AS
   so MI possibly demand in this setting.  He was also noted to be anemic
   post-operatively.  Risk factors include hypertension.  Currently chest
   pain free.  EKG with LBBB which is old, difficult to assess.  Telemetry
   also demonstrated some NSVT since arrival.
   - Continue with heparin gtt which was started at OSH.
   - Now that he has been given plavix load, will stop integrillin.
   Restart if recurrent chest pain.
   - Continue beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated to goal HR 60-70s,
   TID dosing.  Also treat anxiety with ativan which may improve HR.
   - Aspirin, plavix daily
   - Continue to cycle cardiac enzymes.  CK peak last night at 1154.
   - Follow hct as patient is s/p hip surgery.  Slightly down today.
   - Monitor on telemetry in CCU
   - Cardiac catheterization on Monday or sooner if CP recurs, cardiac
   enzymes continue to trend up.
   .
   # Chest pain: Also on differential includes PE vs ACS which is
   described above.  Patient is tachycardic, but not really hypoxic.
   However clinical setting would work ie post op hip with sudden onset
   chest pain.
   - CT chest to rule out PE.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - ACS work up as above.
   .
   # Nose bleed: Packed here but patient has bleeding noted posteriorly.
   - Consult ENT for proper nasal packing.  Saline spray.
   .
   #. Pump: EF 50% on last echocardiogram, appears euvolemic on exam with
   mild O2 requirement.
   - Repeat echocardiogram on Monday.
   .
   #. Rhythm: Normal sinus rhythm, one episode of NSVT since admission.
   - Continue beta blocker, titrate up as tolerated.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. s/p L hip repair: Failed hip arthroplasty s/p revision on [**3-8**].
   Reportedly was doing well from that perspective.  Ambulated with PT
   today without difficulty.  Still with some pain with transferring.
   - Heparin gtt for DVT ppx
   - Pain control PRN
   - PT once patient is cleared from cardiac perspective.
   - Discuss with Ortho regarding appropriate post-operative care.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis and hypertension who underwent left hip revision surgery on March 8th. He developed chest pain 48 hours post-operatively and was found to have non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He has been admitted to the ICU for further management. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure of 125/57 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He has a left bundle branch block (LBBB) on his electrocardiogram.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a nose bleed with packed nasal passages, and a left hip with a surgical dressing that is clean and mildly oozing. His laboratory results show anemia, elevated troponin levels, and mildly abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing heparin infusion, stopping eptifibatide (Integrilin) and restarting it if recurrent chest pain occurs, titrating beta blocker to a goal heart rate of 60-70 beats per minute, and monitoring for cardiac enzymes. A cardiac catheterization is planned for Monday or sooner if chest pain recurs or cardiac enzymes continue to trend upwards.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of aortic stenosis and has developed NSTEMI, which increases his risk of cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient has a nasal bleed and may be at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient has a nose bleed and is at risk for further bleeding complications, particularly in the context of his anticoagulation therapy.
4. Infection: The patient has a left hip surgical site infection and is at risk for further infection complications.
5. Thromboembolic complications: The patient is at risk for thromboembolic complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to his anticoagulation therapy and immobility.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if he continues to bleed or if his underlying anemia is not addressed.
7. Liver function test abnormalities: The patient's mildly abnormal liver function tests may indicate underlying liver disease or injury, which may worsen if not addressed."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 76 year old male with history of AS/AI, HTN s/p L hip
   revision on [**3-8**] who developed chest pain today found to have NSTEMI 48
   hrs after L hip revision ([**3-8**]), transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further
   workup.  Has remained chest pain free since admission.
   .
   #. CAD: Patient developed chest pain in peri-operative setting (48hrs
   out) and found to have positive cardiac markers.  Patient has known AS
   so MI possibly demand in this setting.  He was also noted to be anemic
   post-operatively.  Risk factors include hypertension.  Currently chest
   pain free.  EKG with LBBB which is old, difficult to assess.  Telemetry
   also demonstrated some NSVT since arrival.
   - Continue with heparin gtt which was started at OSH.
   - Now that he has been given plavix load, will stop integrillin.
   Restart if recurrent chest pain.
   - Continue beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated to goal HR 60-70s,
   TID dosing.  Also treat anxiety with ativan which may improve HR.
   - Aspirin, plavix daily
   - Continue to cycle cardiac enzymes.  CK peak last night at 1154.
   - Follow hct as patient is s/p hip surgery.  Slightly down today.
   - Monitor on telemetry in CCU
   - Cardiac catheterization on Monday or sooner if CP recurs, cardiac
   enzymes continue to trend up.
   .
   # Chest pain: Also on differential includes PE vs ACS which is
   described above.  Patient is tachycardic, but not really hypoxic.
   However clinical setting would work ie post op hip with sudden onset
   chest pain.
   - CT chest to rule out PE.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - ACS work up as above.
   .
   # Nose bleed: Packed here but patient has bleeding noted posteriorly.
   - Consult ENT for proper nasal packing.  Saline spray.
   .
   #. Pump: EF 50% on last echocardiogram, appears euvolemic on exam with
   mild O2 requirement.
   - Repeat echocardiogram on Monday.
   .
   #. Rhythm: Normal sinus rhythm, one episode of NSVT since admission.
   - Continue beta blocker, titrate up as tolerated.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. s/p L hip repair: Failed hip arthroplasty s/p revision on [**3-8**].
   Reportedly was doing well from that perspective.  Ambulated with PT
   today without difficulty.  Still with some pain with transferring.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and hypertension, who underwent left hip revision surgery on March 8th. He developed chest pain 48 hours post-operatively, which was found to be a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He has been admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure of 125/57 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is receiving heparin and eptifibatide infusions, as well as beta blockers and aspirin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of AS and has developed NSTEMI, which increases his risk of cardiac complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's oxygen saturation is 96%, but he may still be at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia, particularly given his recent surgery and hospitalization.
3. Bleeding Complications: The patient has a nose bleed and is receiving anticoagulant therapy, which increases his risk of bleeding complications.
4. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk for VTE due to his recent surgery and immobility, and is receiving heparin prophylaxis.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his recent surgery and hospitalization, and may require antibiotic prophylaxis.
6. Cardiac Catheterization: The patient is scheduled for cardiac catheterization on Monday or sooner if his cardiac enzymes continue to trend up, which may carry risks such as bleeding and cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient is at risk for PE due to his recent surgery and immobility, and is scheduled for a CT chest to rule out PE.
8. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.0 g/dL, which may indicate anemia, particularly given his recent blood loss and surgery.
9. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium level is 8.9 mg/dL, which may indicate hypocalcemia, particularly given his recent surgery and hospitalization.
10. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, including potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus, may be abnormal due to his recent surgery and hospitalization, which may require close monitoring and correction."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition remains stable, with no significant changes in vital signs or laboratory results. The patient is receiving infusions of heparin sodium and eptifibatide (Integrilin) to manage their bleeding risk.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's bleeding risk is increased due to the use of anticoagulants, which can lead to bleeding complications such as hematomas, bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, or bleeding from the surgical site.
2. Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised due to their underlying medical condition, which increases their risk of developing infections. Infections can be life-threatening and require prompt treatment.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation levels are within normal limits, but their respiratory rate is slightly elevated. This may indicate underlying respiratory failure, which can progress rapidly and require mechanical ventilation.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's heart rhythm is abnormal, with a left bundle branch block (LBBB). This can increase their risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening.
5. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine levels are slightly elevated, which may indicate underlying renal insufficiency. This can increase their risk of developing acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are slightly elevated, which may indicate underlying hyperglycemia. This can increase their risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is slightly low, which may indicate underlying thrombocytopenia. This can increase their risk of bleeding complications.

In conclusion, the patient's condition remains stable, but they are at risk for various medical complications. Close monitoring and prompt treatment are necessary to prevent or manage these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 76 year old male with history of AS/AI, HTN s/p L hip
   revision on [**3-8**] who developed chest pain today found to have NSTEMI 48
   hrs after L hip revision ([**3-8**]), transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further
   workup.
   .
   #. CAD: Patient developed chest pain in peri-operative setting (48hrs
   out) and found to have positive cardiac markers.  Patient has known AS
   so MI possibly demand in this setting.  He was also noted to be anemic
   post-operatively.  Risk factors include hypertension.  Currently chest
   pain free.  EKG with LBBB which is old, difficult to assess.  Telemetry
   also demonstrated some NSVT since arrival.
   - Continue with heparin gtt which was started at OSH.
   - Start integrillin gtt with bolus given large CK leak and prolonged
   symptoms.
   - Continue beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated to goal HR 60-70s.
   - Aspirin, plavix load
   - Continue to cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Follow hct as patient is s/p hip surgery
   - Repeat EKG in the AM.
   - Monitor on telemetry in CCU
   - Cardiac catheterization on Monday or sooner if CP recurs, cardiac
   enzymes continue to trend up.
   .
   #. Pump: EF 50% on last echocardiogram, appears euvolemic on exam with
   mild O2 requirement.
   - Repeat echocardiogram on Monday.
   - Check CXR on admission
   .
   #. Rhythm: Normal sinus rhythm, one episode of NSVT since admission.
   - Continue beta blocker, titrate up as tolerated.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. s/p L hip repair: Failed hip arthroplasty s/p revision on [**3-8**].
   Reportedly was doing well from that perspective.  Ambulated with PT
   today without difficulty.  Still with some pain with transferring.
   - Heparin gtt for DVT ppx
   - Pain control PRN
   - PT once patient is cleared from cardiac perspective.
   .
   #. FEN
   - Cardiac heart healthy diet
   - Monitor lytes and replete PRN
   .
   #. Access:  PIV x2
   .
   #. PPx:  heparin gtt, bowel regimen, regular diet.
   .
   #. Code: Full code

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 76 year old male with history of AS/AI, HTN s/p L hip
   revision on [**3-8**] who developed chest pain today found to have NSTEMI 48
   hrs after L hip revision ([**3-8**]), transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further
   workup.
   .
   #. CAD: Patient developed chest pain in peri-operative setting (48hrs
   out) and found to have positive cardiac markers.  Patient has known AS
   so MI possibly demand in this setting.  He was also noted to be anemic
   post-operatively.  Risk factors include hypertension.  Currently chest
   pain free.  EKG with LBBB which is old, difficult to assess.  Telemetry
   also demonstrated some NSVT since arrival.
   - Continue with heparin gtt which was started at OSH.
   - Start integrillin gtt with bolus given large CK leak and prolonged
   symptoms.
   - Continue beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated to goal HR 60-70s.
   - Aspirin, plavix load
   - Continue to cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Follow hct as patient is s/p hip surgery
   - Repeat EKG in the AM.
   - Monitor on telemetry in CCU
   - Cardiac catheterization on Monday or sooner if CP recurs, cardiac
   enzymes continue to trend up.
   .
   #. Pump: EF 50% on last echocardiogram, appears euvolemic on exam with
   mild O2 requirement.
   - Repeat echocardiogram on Monday.
   - Check CXR on admission
   .
   #. Rhythm: Normal sinus rhythm, one episode of NSVT since admission.
   - Continue beta blocker, titrate up as tolerated.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. s/p L hip repair: Failed hip arthroplasty s/p revision on [**3-8**].
   Reportedly was doing well from that perspective.  Ambulated with PT
   today without difficulty.  Still with some pain with transferring.
   - Heparin gtt for DVT ppx
   - Pain control PRN

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of aortic stenosis and hypertension who developed chest pain 48 hours after left hip revision surgery, which was found to be a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He has been treated with heparin, eptifibatide, and beta blockers, and is being monitored for cardiac enzymes, hemodynamics, and rhythm. He is also being managed for pain control, DVT prophylaxis, and bowel regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending up, and he has a history of aortic stenosis, which increases the risk of cardiac complications. He may be at risk for further cardiac events, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient has a mild oxygen requirement and may be at risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
3. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, which may indicate renal dysfunction or failure.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin and eptifibatide, which increases the risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or hematuria.
5. Infection complications: The patient has a central line and is at risk for central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs).
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to the anticoagulation therapy and the presence of a nasogastric tube.
7. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of left hip revision surgery and may be at risk for neurological complications, such as peripheral neuropathy or cerebral vasospasm.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Platelet count (Plt): 217 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.49 ng/mL
* Glucose: 139 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the lack of assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias due to left bundle branch block (LBBB)
* Hemodynamic instability due to fluid imbalance
* Sepsis or septic shock due to potential infection
* Respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation
* Renal failure due to decreased renal perfusion
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulceration
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility
* Nosocomial infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI)

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan should be implemented:

* Monitor vital signs and hemodynamic parameters closely
* Continue to manage fluid balance and electrolytes
* Administer antibiotics and anticoagulants as prescribed
* Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Monitor for signs of sepsis or septic shock
* Consider invasive cardiac monitoring and hemodynamic support as needed
* Monitor for respiratory failure and consider mechanical ventilation if necessary
* Monitor for gastrointestinal bleeding and consider endoscopy if necessary
* Monitor for DVT or PE and consider anticoagulation therapy as needed
* Monitor for nosocomial infections and consider appropriate antibiotic therapy if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis (AS), aortic insufficiency (AI), hypertension, and recent left hip revision surgery on [**3-8**]. He developed chest pain today and was found to have Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) 48 hours after the hip revision surgery. He was transferred to the catheterization laboratory (cath lab) for further evaluation and treatment.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 38.1°C, Tcurrent 37.6°C, HR 82 bpm, BP 111/52 mmHg, RR 15 inspirations per minute, SpO2 94%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion at 1,250 units per hour.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,099 mL of fluid and has lost 2,275 mL of fluid, resulting in a negative balance of 1,176 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is not receiving oxygen therapy, but his SpO2 is 94%.
* Physical examination: The patient is lying in bed and appears to be in no acute distress. He has a systolic murmur heard on his cardiovascular examination.
* Laboratory results: The patient's hemoglobin (Hb) level is 8.7 g/dL, platelet count is 217 K/uL, and white blood cell count is 10.7 K/uL. His troponin-T level is 0.49 ng/mL.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) due to the NSTEMI diagnosis
* Pulmonary embolism (PE) despite a negative computed tomography angiogram (CTA)
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to the patient's history of aortic stenosis and aortic insufficiency, as well as the recent hip revision surgery
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's history of aortic stenosis and aortic insufficiency
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's age and underlying medical conditions
* Infection due to the patient's recent surgery and the use of central lines and other invasive devices.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan of care can be considered:

* Continue heparin sodium infusion at 1,250 units per hour
* Continue beta blocker therapy to manage the patient's cardiac condition
* Restart ACE inhibitor therapy once the patient is cleared from the cardiac perspective
* Continue monitoring the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjusting therapy as necessary
* Monitor the patient's fluid balance and adjust fluid administration accordingly
* Continue prophylactic measures to prevent DVT and other complications
* Discuss the patient's post-operative care with the orthopedic team and consider transferring the patient to the floor once cleared from the cardiac perspective."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis (AS), hypertension, and a recent left hip revision on March 8th. He developed chest pain today and was found to have a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) 48 hours after the hip revision.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is receiving treatment for his cardiac condition. He has a left bundle branch block (LBBB) and a late peaking systolic murmur heard in the right upper sternal border (RUSB) crescendo decrescendo with a soft S2. His physical examination is otherwise unremarkable.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.7, a hemoglobin level of 23.3, and a platelet count of 194. His troponin-T level is 0.49, and his creatine kinase (CK) level is 1098.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Acute systolic and diastolic heart failure
* Anterior STEMI
* Severe AS
* Anemia with low post-operative hemoglobin levels
* Possible pulmonary embolism (PE)

The patient's medications include:

* Heparin sodium
* Beta blockers
* Plavix
* Aspirin
* ACE inhibitors

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Heart failure
* Pulmonary embolism
* Anemia
* Infection

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing beta blockers and plavix
* Restarting ACE inhibitors once cleared from cardiac perspective
* Monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias
* Continuing heparin gtt for now, with reassessment after cath lab
* Repeat echocardiogram
* Maintaining even fluid status
* Monitoring for signs of infection
* Discussing post-operative care with orthopedic team
* Consideration of lovenox for DVT prophylaxis

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to the cath lab this morning."

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis and hypertension who underwent left hip revision surgery on March 8th. He developed chest pain 48 hours after surgery, which was found to be a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He was transferred to the ICU for further workup and management.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 38.1°C, heart rate 82 bpm, blood pressure 111/52 mmHg, respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 94%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: He is receiving heparin sodium infusion at a rate of 1,250 units per hour.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,099 mL of fluids and has lost 2,275 mL of fluids.
* Respiratory support: The patient is not receiving any respiratory support.
* Labs: The patient's hemoglobin is 8.7 g/dL, hematocrit is 23.3%, and platelet count is 194 K/uL.
* Medical history: The patient has a history of aortic stenosis, hypertension, and left hip revision surgery.
* Current medications: The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion, aspirin, and clopidogrel.

Potential medical complications:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's NSTEMI and history of aortic stenosis put him at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and arrhythmias.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient's tachycardia and chest pain could be indicative of a pulmonary embolism, which is a potential complication of hip surgery.
* Bleeding complications: The patient's nose bleed and posterior bleeding could be indicative of bleeding complications related to his anticoagulation therapy.
* Infection: The patient's history of hip surgery and presence of drains and tubes increase his risk of infection.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 194 K/uL, which is slightly low. This could be a sign of thrombocytopenia, which is a potential complication of anticoagulation therapy.
* Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL, which is slightly elevated. This could be a sign of renal insufficiency, which is a potential complication of anticoagulation therapy.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is recommended that he continue to receive anticoagulation therapy with heparin sodium infusion and aspirin, and that his platelet count be monitored regularly to prevent thrombocytopenia. The patient should also be monitored for signs of cardiac complications, pulmonary embolism, bleeding complications, infection, and renal insufficiency."

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male who underwent left hip revision surgery on March 8th and developed chest pain today, which was found to be a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) 48 hours after the surgery. The patient has a history of aortic stenosis and hypertension. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated with heparin, beta blockers, and aspirin. The patient has a packed nasal cavity due to a nosebleed and is being followed by the ENT department.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of aortic stenosis and has developed an NSTEMI, which may lead to further cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock.
2. Pulmonary embolism: Although the CTA was negative, there is still a risk of pulmonary embolism, especially given the patient's history of aortic stenosis and the use of heparin.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's oxygen requirement may increase, and there is a risk of respiratory failure, especially if the patient develops pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's bleeding from the nose may be a sign of a coagulopathy, which could lead to gastrointestinal bleeding or other bleeding complications.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of aortic stenosis and the use of heparin may increase the risk of neurological complications such as stroke or transient ischemic attack.
6. Infection: The patient's use of antibiotics and the presence of a central line may increase the risk of infection, especially sepsis or central line-associated bloodstream infection.
7. Bleeding complications: The patient's bleeding from the nose and the use of heparin may increase the risk of bleeding complications, especially gastrointestinal bleeding or retroperitoneal bleeding.
8. Renal failure: The patient's history of aortic stenosis and the use of heparin may increase the risk of renal failure, especially if the patient develops acute kidney injury.
9. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, especially if the patient develops bleeding complications or gastrointestinal bleeding.
10. Pain management: The patient's pain from the hip revision surgery and the NSTEMI may be challenging to manage, especially if the patient develops opioid-related adverse effects."

   TTE:The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
   basal half of the inferolateral wall, distal half of the anteroseptal
   and anterior walls, and apex. The remaining segments contract well
   (LVEF= 35 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
   There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral leaflets and supporting structures
   are mildly fibrotic. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be quantified. There is no
   pericardial effusion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male who underwent left hip revision surgery on [**3-8**] and developed chest pain 48 hours later, which was found to be a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He was transferred to the cardiology service and underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed severe aortic stenosis and three-vessel coronary artery disease. He was referred to cardiac surgery for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR).

Current Status:

* The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis, mild aortic regurgitation, and mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
* He is on cardiac medications, including beta blockers, aspirin, and heparin, and is being monitored for cardiac rhythm disturbances.
* His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure of 107/45 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
* He has a small hematoma in his left hip and is at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
* He is being monitored for signs of sciatic nerve compression and is receiving pain management as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's severe aortic stenosis and three-vessel coronary artery disease put him at risk for cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
* Pulmonary complications: The patient's mild aortic regurgitation and pulmonary arterial hypertension put him at risk for pulmonary complications, including pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.
* Neurological complications: The patient's left hip hematoma and risk of sciatic nerve compression put him at risk for neurological complications, including numbness, tingling, and weakness in his legs.
* Thrombotic complications: The patient's risk of DVT and PE requires close monitoring and prophylactic measures, including anticoagulation therapy.
* Infection complications: The patient's risk of infection, particularly in the setting of his recent surgery and cardiac catheterization, requires close monitoring and prompt treatment of any suspected infections.

Recommendations:

* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust his medications as needed to prevent cardiac complications.
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his oxygen therapy as needed to prevent respiratory failure.
* Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his pain management as needed to prevent neurological complications.
* Monitor the patient's thrombotic risk and adjust his anticoagulation therapy as needed to prevent DVT and PE.
* Monitor the patient's infection risk and adjust his antibiotic therapy as needed to prevent infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   24 Hour Events:
   [**2114-3-12**]
   Cardiac cath:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Severe aortic stenosis (although [**Location (un) 342**] cannot be calculated with
   confidence given known aortic regurgitation).
   3. Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
   4. Severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   5. Procedure-related atrial fibrillation. Given severity of diastolic
   heart failure and aortic valve disease, recommendation is to pursue
   elective cardioversion in the CCU.
   6. Cardiac surgery consultation for suitability for AVR-CABG.
   .
   TTE:The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
   basal half of the inferolateral wall, distal half of the anteroseptal
   and anterior walls, and apex. The remaining segments contract well
   (LVEF= 35 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
   There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral leaflets and supporting structures
   are mildly fibrotic. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be quantified. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Severe aortic stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old male who underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have severe aortic stenosis, mild aortic regurgitation, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and mild mitral regurgitation. He was also found to have multivessel coronary artery disease. The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and he is at risk for cardiac complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's severe aortic stenosis and left ventricular systolic dysfunction put him at high risk for cardiac arrest.
2. Sepsis: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central lines and catheters increase his risk for sepsis.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension increase his risk for respiratory failure.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease (CKD) and use of nephrotoxic medications increase his risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) and renal failure.
5. Bleeding Complications: The patient's use of anticoagulant medications and presence of central lines and catheters increase his risk for bleeding complications.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's history of stroke and presence of central lines and catheters increase his risk for neurological complications such as seizures and stroke.
7. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central lines and catheters increase his risk for infection.
8. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and presence of cardiac catheters increase his risk for cardiac arrhythmias.
9. Heart Failure: The patient's severe aortic stenosis and left ventricular systolic dysfunction put him at high risk for heart failure.
10. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient's severe aortic stenosis and presence of central lines and catheters increase his risk for cardiac tamponade.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these potential complications and to optimize his cardiac function."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old male with history of AS/AI, HTN s/p L hip revision on [**3-8**]
   who developed chest pain today found to have NSTEMI 48 hrs after L hip
   revision ([**3-8**]), transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] and now in the cath lab.
   .
   #. CAD: Pt transferred to cardiology service with post-op MI in setting
   of increased exertion and demand. Etiology thought likely related to
   peri-operative setting, demand related to AS, and demand related to
   anemia with low post-op HCTs.
   -          cath lab today
   -          continue beta blocker, plavix, aspirin
   -          restart ACEI once returns from cath
    .
   2. Chest pain: Etiology is most likely ACS. Pulmonary embolism is
   unlikely given negative CTA. Will reassess after cath
   - Continue heparin gtt for now, will have received 48 hours at 8pm
   - ACS work up as above.
   .
   3. Nose bleed: Packed here but patient has bleeding noted posteriorly.
   - appreciate ENT recs
   - follow HCT [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   4. Pump: EF 50% on last echocardiogram, appears euvolemic on exam with
   mild O2 requirement.
   - Repeat echocardiogram
   - maintain even
   .
   5. Rhythm: Normal sinus rhythm, one episode of NSVT since admission.
   - Continue beta blocker, titrate up as tolerated.
   - Monitor on telemetry

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Cardiac cath:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Severe aortic stenosis (although [**Location (un) 342**] cannot be calculated with
   confidence given known aortic regurgitation).
   3. Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
   4. Severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   5. Procedure-related atrial fibrillation. Given severity of diastolic
   heart failure and aortic valve disease, recommendation is to pursue
   elective cardioversion in the CCU.
   6. Cardiac surgery consultation for suitability for AVR-CABG.
   .
   TTE:The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
   basal half of the inferolateral wall, distal half of the anteroseptal
   and anterior walls, and apex. The remaining segments contract well
   (LVEF= 35 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
   There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral leaflets and supporting structures
   are mildly fibrotic. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be quantified. There is no
   pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old male with history of AS/AI, HTN s/p L hip revision on [**3-8**]
   who developed chest pain today found to have NSTEMI 48 hrs after L hip
   revision ([**3-8**]), transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] and now in the cath lab.
   .
   #. CAD: Pt transferred to cardiology service with post-op MI in setting
   of increased exertion and demand. Etiology thought likely related to
   peri-operative setting, demand related to AS, and demand related to
   anemia with low post-op HCTs.
   -          cath lab today
   -          continue beta blocker, plavix, aspirin
   -          restart ACEI once returns from cath
    .
   2. Chest pain: Etiology is most likely ACS. Pulmonary embolism is
   unlikely given negative CTA. Will reassess after cath
   - Continue heparin gtt for now, will have received 48 hours at 8pm
   - ACS work up as above.
   .
   3. Nose bleed: Packed here but patient has bleeding noted posteriorly.
   - appreciate ENT recs
   - follow HCT [**Hospital1 7**]

   4. Pump: EF 50% on last echocardiogram, appears euvolemic on exam with
   mild O2 requirement.
   - Repeat echocardiogram
   - maintain even

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male who underwent left hip revision on March 8th and developed chest pain today, leading to a diagnosis of NSTEMI 48 hours after the surgery. He has a history of aortic stenosis and anemia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiac: He has severe aortic stenosis, mild aortic regurgitation, and mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with multivessel CAD. He has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35%.
* Respiratory: He has a mild anterior chest wall tenderness and is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula.
* Neurological: He is alert and awake, following commands.
* Laboratory results: His white blood cell count is 10.7, hemoglobin is 9.3 g/dL, and platelet count is 194.
* Electrolyte levels: His sodium level is 137 mmol/L, potassium level is 4.2 mmol/L, and magnesium level is 2.5 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Cardiac complications: Given the patient's severe aortic stenosis and mild aortic regurgitation, he is at risk for cardiac complications such as atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's mild anterior chest wall tenderness and oxygen therapy via nasal cannula may indicate underlying respiratory issues, such as pneumonia or pulmonary embolism.
* Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and seizure activity may indicate underlying neurological issues, such as stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage.
* Hematological complications: The patient's anemia and low platelet count may indicate underlying hematological issues, such as bleeding or thrombocytopenia.
* Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate underlying infection, such as sepsis or pneumonia.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following plan is recommended:

* Continue beta blocker, plavix, and aspirin therapy to manage the patient's cardiac condition.
* Restart ACEI once the patient returns from the cath lab.
* Continue heparin gtt for now, but reassess after the cath lab.
* Repeat echocardiogram to monitor the patient's cardiac function.
* Monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and adjust therapy as needed.
* Continue pain control PRN for the patient's hip pain.
* Discuss post-op anticoagulation with the orthopedic team and consider lovenox therapy.
* Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and replete as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust therapy as needed.
* Consider antibiotics for the patient's respiratory symptoms."
