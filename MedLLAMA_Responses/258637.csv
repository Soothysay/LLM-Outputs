   41 yo woman with acute v. acute on chronic liver failure p/w
   significant hematemesis, s/p banding of esophageal varices.
   .
   # Hematemesis: Source appears to be esophageal varices based on EGD
   tonight, now s/p banding x 4 without further evidence of active bleed.
   Has received 2 units pRBC and 2 units FFP (INR 2.6).  Remains HD
   stable. Ddx includes gastric varices (visualization impaired by clotted
   blood), PUD (gastric or duodenal), M-W tear, malignancy.
   - Continue octreotide gtt x 3 days and pantoprazole gtt for now
   - D/c prednisone
   - Active T&S, q6h Hct, trend coags, transfuse for goal Hct 25 (will
   give 1 unit pRBCs now)
   - Goal INR < 2.0 (will give 1 unit FFP now)
   - Keep NPO for now, consider clears in AM if stable
   - Ceftriaxone for SBP ppx and possible role in clot stabilization
   - If re-bleeds, would need to consider TIPS (will alert IR)
   - Appreciate Liver recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic liver failure: Most consistent with EtOH etiology.
   Does have some synthetic function, significant ascites (reaccumulation
   despite 3L para on [**4-14**]), portal hypertension, and now evidence of
   esophageal varices.
   - Monitor LFTs, coags
   - D/c prednisone as above
   - Continue pentoxyfilline for now; confirm with Liver
   - F/u liver bx
   - Consider therapeutic paracentesis
   - Hold diuretics for now
   - NPO for now but low Na when resumes diets
   - Check bladder pressure
 may require repeat paracentesis if elevated
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: This is mostly likely from acute hepatitis,
   prednisone; [**2186-4-15**] urine cx now growing E. coli. C. diff negative.
   [**4-14**] paracentesis not c/w SBP
   - Cont ceftriaxone for SBP ppx and to cover UTI
   - F/u micro
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to liver failure with hypovolemia, improving
   - Cont to monitor on fluid restriction
   - F/u renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # ETOH use: No evidence with withdrawal now.
   - Monitor for withdrawal symptoms
   - Resume MVI, thiamine, folate when able to take PO
   - Social work has been consulted
   # AMS: Likely secondary to sedation from morphine this AM. No evidence
   of encephalopathy, but if pt becomes confused or develops asterixis,
   would consider lactulose PO/PR.
   - Will monitor over course of day, adjust pain meds PRN
   # Tachycardia: Possibly related to blood loss/hypovolemia as well as
   component of pain.
   - Will monitor after transfusions

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with gastrointestinal bleeding (melena). They received 2 units of packed red blood cells and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma within 24 hours. The patient is being treated with various medications, including octreotide, pantoprazole, midazolam, fentanyl, and morphine sulfate. They are receiving respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen and have a SpO2 of 96%. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 121 bpm, and blood pressure of 123/73 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, lactate dehydrogenase, and liver enzymes. Their blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels are within normal limits. The patient's platelet count is 156 K/uL, and their hemoglobin level is 8.9 g/dL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is a significant concern, and it is essential to monitor their condition closely to prevent further bleeding and potential complications such as hypovolemic shock.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes suggest the possibility of sepsis. It is crucial to monitor their vital signs and laboratory results for signs of sepsis, such as fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's low platelet count and elevated liver enzymes suggest the possibility of coagulopathy. It is essential to monitor their coagulation studies and platelet count to prevent bleeding complications.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated lactate dehydrogenase and liver enzymes suggest the possibility of acute kidney injury. It is crucial to monitor their renal function and urine output to prevent acute kidney injury.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes suggest the possibility of infection. It is essential to monitor their vital signs and laboratory results for signs of infection, such as fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient's use of stress ulcer prophylaxis suggests the possibility of stress ulcer. It is essential to monitor their gastrointestinal symptoms and laboratory results to prevent stress ulcer.
7. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's use of DVT prophylaxis suggests the possibility of venous thromboembolism. It is essential to monitor their vital signs and laboratory results for signs of venous thromboembolism, such as tachycardia and tachypnea."

   41 yo woman with acute v. acute on chronic liver failure p/w
   significant hematemesis, s/p banding of esophageal varices.
   .
   # Hematemesis: Source appears to be esophageal varices based on EGD
   tonight, now s/p banding x 4 without further evidence of active bleed.
   Has received 2 units pRBC and 2 units FFP (INR 2.6).  Remains HD
   stable. Ddx includes gastric varices (visualization impaired by clotted
   blood), PUD (gastric or duodenal), M-W tear, malignancy.
   - Continue octreotide gtt x 3 days and pantoprazole gtt for now
   - D/c prednisone
   - Active T&S, q6h Hct, trend coags, transfuse for goal Hct 25
   - Keep NPO for now, consider clears in AM if stable
   - Ceftriaxone for SBP ppx and possible role in clot stabilization
   - If rebleeds, would need to consider TIPS
   - Appreciate Liver recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic liver failure: Most consistent with EtOH etiology.
   Does have some synthetic function, significant ascites (reaccumulation
   despite 3L para on [**4-14**]), portal hypertension, and now evidence of
   esophageal varices.
   - Monitor LFTs, coags
   - D/c prednisone as above
   - Continue pentoxyfilline for now; confirm with Liver
   - F/u liver bx
   - Consider therapeutic paracentesis
   - Hold diuretics for now
   - NPO for now but low Na when resumes diets
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: This is mostly likely from acute hepatitis,
   prednisone; [**2186-4-15**] urine cx now growing E. coli. C. diff negative.
   [**4-14**] paracentesis not c/w SBP
   - Cont ceftriaxone for SBP ppx and to cover UTI
   - F/u micro
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to liver failure with hypovolemia, improving
   - Cont to monitor on fluid restriction
   - F/u renal recs

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old woman with acute-on-chronic liver failure, who presented with significant hematemesis, and was found to have bleeding from esophageal varices. She has received 2 units of packed red blood cells and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma. Her current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 35.6°C (96°F)
* Heart rate: 121 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 123/73 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%

She is receiving octreotide and pantoprazole infusions, as well as other medications to manage her condition. Her laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 156 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 14.1 K/uL
* International normalized ratio (INR): 2.6
* Partial thromboplastin time (PTT): 38.6 seconds
* Lactic acid: 2.0 mmol/L

The patient has a diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding, upper (melena, GI bleed, GIB), and is being treated with banding of esophageal varices, octreotide, and pantoprazole. She is also being monitored for potential complications such as gastric varices, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), Mallory-Weiss tear, and malignancy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Rebleeding from the esophageal varices
* Development of gastric varices
* Peptic ulcer disease (PUD)
* Mallory-Weiss tear
* Malignancy
* Hepatic encephalopathy
* Renal failure
* Respiratory failure
* Infection (UTI, pneumonia)
* Hemodynamic instability
* Coagulopathy

The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and further treatment and management will depend on her response to current therapy and any changes in her condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   41 yr old  with new diagnosis of EtOH cirrhosis, hematemesis yesterday
   - EGD revealed bleeding esophageal varices, now s/p 4 bands.
   GI Bleed/Blood Loss Anemia: S/p banding.  Monitor frequent Hcts.  Still
   tachycardic - transfus 1 additional unit of pRBCs and 1 of FFP.
   Protonix gtt.  Restart clears later today if she remains stable.
   Abd Pain: Improved this AM.  mildly tender on exam.  Will probably need
   another paracentesis - but will defere for today due to concerns about
   her hemodynamics.
   Cirrhosis: Will need to restart lactulose and rifaxamin when restarting
   clears.  Monitor LFTs.  Cont CTX for SBP ppx - also treating UTI with
   the CTX

   41 yo woman with acute v. acute on chronic liver failure p/w
   significant hematemesis, s/p banding of esophageal varices.
   .
   # Hematemesis/Melena: Source appears to be esophageal varices based on
   EGD, now s/p banding x 4 without further evidence of active bleed. Has
   received 6 units pRBC total since [**4-16**] (including 3 during morning of
   [**4-17**]), 6u FFP, 2u cryo.  Remains HD stable. Ddx includes gastric
   varices (visualization impaired by clotted blood), PUD (gastric or
   duodenal), M-W tear, malignancy.
   - Continue octreotide gtt x 3 days (day 1 = [**4-16**]) and pantoprazole gtt
   for now
   - Prednisone discontinued per liver team as may increase bleeding
   - Active T&S, q6h Hct, trend coags, transfuse for goal Hct 25
   (transfuse 1 unit now [**4-18**] am)
   - Transfuse FFP for goal INR < 2.0
   - Keep NPO for now; ADAT by mental status
   - Ceftriaxone for SBP ppx and possible role in clot stabilization (day
   1 = [**4-16**])
   - If re-bleeds, would need to consider TIPS (IR evaluated pt on [**4-17**])
   - Appreciate Liver recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic liver failure: Most consistent with EtOH etiology.
   Does have some synthetic dysfunction, significant ascites
   (reaccumulation despite 3L paracentesis on [**4-14**]), portal hypertension,
   and now evidence of esophageal varices.
   - Monitor LFTs qd, coags [**Hospital1 **]
   - Prednisone discontinued as above
   - Continue pentoxyfilline for now (day 1 = [**4-12**])
   - F/u liver bx (pending)
   - Therapeutic paracentesis when stable followed by albumin [**6-6**] g/L of
   fluid removed
   - Hold diuretics for now
   - Low sodium diet when tolerating POs
   - Monitor bladder pressure
 may require repeat paracentesis if
   elevated (18 on [**4-17**] at 11pm)

   - Monitor for withdrawal symptoms
   - Resume MVI, thiamine, folate when able to take PO
   - Social work has been consulted
   # AMS: Likely secondary to sedation from morphine. No evidence of
   encephalopathy at present.
   - Lactulose PO/PR.
   - Will monitor over course of day, adjust pain meds PRN
   # Tachycardia: Likely related to blood loss/hypovolemia as well as
   component of pain. Concern for occult infection though afebrile.
   - Will monitor
   # FEN: No IVFs, monitor/replete electrolytes, sips (when taking POs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo woman with acute v. acute on chronic liver failure p/w
   significant hematemesis, s/p banding of esophageal varices.
   .
   # Hematemesis/Melena: Source appears to be esophageal varices based on
   EGD, now s/p banding x 4 without further evidence of active bleed. Has
   received 6 units pRBC total since [**4-16**] (including 3 during morning of
   [**4-17**]), 6u FFP, 2u cryo.  Remains HD stable. Ddx includes gastric
   varices (visualization impaired by clotted blood), PUD (gastric or
   duodenal), M-W tear, malignancy.
   - Continue octreotide gtt x 3 days (day 1 = [**4-16**]) and pantoprazole gtt
   for now
   - Prednisone discontinued per liver team as may increase bleeding
   - Active T&S, q6h Hct, trend coags, transfuse for goal Hct 25
   (transfuse 1 unit now [**4-18**] am)
   - Transfuse FFP for goal INR < 2.0
   - Keep NPO for now; ADAT by mental status
   - Ceftriaxone for SBP ppx and possible role in clot stabilization (day
   1 = [**4-16**])
   - If re-bleeds, would need to consider TIPS (IR evaluated pt on [**4-17**])
   - Appreciate Liver recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic liver failure: Most consistent with EtOH etiology.
   Does have some synthetic dysfunction, significant ascites
   (reaccumulation despite 3L paracentesis on [**4-14**]), portal hypertension,
   and now evidence of esophageal varices.
   - Monitor LFTs qd, coags [**Hospital1 **]
   - Prednisone discontinued as above
   - Continue pentoxyfilline for now (day 1 = [**4-12**])
   - F/u liver bx (pending)
   - Therapeutic paracentesis when stable followed by albumin [**6-6**] g/L of
   fluid removed
   - Hold diuretics for now
   - Low sodium diet when tolerating POs
   - Monitor bladder pressure
 may require repeat paracentesis if
   elevated (18 on [**4-17**] at 11pm)
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: This is mostly likely from acute hepatitis,
   prednisone; [**2186-4-15**] urine cx growing E. coli. C. diff negative. [**4-14**]
   paracentesis not c/w SBP.
   - Cont ceftriaxone for SBP ppx and to cover UTI (day 1 = [**4-16**]) for 3
   day course for UTI (Foley inserted [**4-17**])
   - F/u micro
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to liver failure with hypovolemia, resolved
   - Cont to monitor on fluid restriction
   - Appreciate renal recs; team has now signed off.
   - Daily electrolytes
   .
   # ETOH use: No evidence for withdrawal now.
   - Monitor for withdrawal symptoms
   - Resume MVI, thiamine, folate when able to take PO
   - Social work has been consulted
   # AMS: Likely secondary to sedation from morphine. No evidence of
   encephalopathy at present.
   - Lactulose PO/PR.
   - Will monitor over course of day, adjust pain meds PRN
   # Tachycardia: Likely related to blood loss/hypovolemia as well as
   component of pain. Concern for occult infection though afebrile.
   - Will monitor
   # FEN: No IVFs, monitor/replete electrolytes, sips (when taking POs
   will use 1L fluid restriction and low sodium diet)

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old woman with acute-on-chronic liver failure, presenting with significant hematemesis, s/p banding of esophageal varices. The patient has received 6 units of packed red blood cells, 6 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 2 units of cryoprecipitate since admission.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.4°C (99.4°F)
* Heart rate: 107 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 133/84 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 92%
* SpO2: 92%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 156 x 10^9/L
* White blood cell count: 14.1 x 10^9/L
* Bilirubin: 131 mg/dL
* Albumin: 25.9 g/L
* International normalized ratio (INR): 1.8
* Partial thromboplastin time (PTT): 33.1 seconds
* Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT): 19.9 seconds

The patient's medical conditions include acute-on-chronic liver failure, significant hematemesis, and possible gastric varices. The patient has received octreotide and pantoprazole for bleeding prophylaxis and treatment.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Re-bleeding: The patient has received treatment for bleeding, but the source of bleeding is still unclear. Re-bleeding is a possibility, especially if the patient's liver function does not improve.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of E. coli urinary tract infection and may be at risk for further infections, particularly in the context of liver failure and immunosuppression.
3. Encephalopathy: The patient's liver function is impaired, and encephalopathy may develop if the patient's liver function does not improve.
4. Renal failure: The patient's liver function is impaired, and renal failure may develop if the patient's kidneys are not functioning properly.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's liver function is impaired, and malnutrition may develop if the patient is not able to absorb nutrients properly.
6. Fluid overload: The patient has received large volumes of fluid, and fluid overload may develop if the patient's kidneys are not functioning properly.
7. Sepsis: The patient has a history of E. coli urinary tract infection and may be at risk for sepsis, particularly in the context of liver failure and immunosuppression.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Monitoring of liver function and bleeding
2. Treatment of bleeding with octreotide and pantoprazole
3. Antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infection
4. Monitoring of electrolytes and fluid balance
5. Nutritional support with lactulose and albumin
6. Pain management with morphine and lidocaine patch
7. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer

The patient's disposition is pending, but it is likely that she will require further treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) to manage her medical conditions and prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 ARTERIAL LINE - START [**2186-4-17**] 08:29 PM
   placed at ?4pm
   - During the day, large volume of melana, tachy to 130s. Transfused 3U
   PRBC (6 units total since [**4-16**]), 4u FFP, 2u cryo. Unclear if new
   bleeding or old from overnight (have to assume it new). Hepatology has
   no plans to re-scope or place [**Last Name (un) 1048**] if opens up. IR called to
   evaluate for urgent TIPS. HCT stabilized after transfusions so plan to
   manage conservatively for now.
   - GI recs: Lactulose PO/PR (start with PR enemas and progress to PO
   once mental status improves); advance diet as tolerated according to
   mental status; when stable, patient should undergo paracentesis
   (therapeutic) followed by albumin [**6-6**] g/L of fluid removed; continue
   PPI; continue ceftriaxone; Dobhoff tube if unable to tolerate PO diet;

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo woman with acute v. acute on chronic liver failure p/w
   significant hematemesis, s/p banding of esophageal varices.
   .
   # Hematemesis: Source appears to be esophageal varices based on EGD
   tonight, now s/p banding x 4 without further evidence of active bleed.
   Has received 2 units pRBC and 2 units FFP (INR 2.6).  Remains HD
   stable. Ddx includes gastric varices (visualization impaired by clotted
   blood), PUD (gastric or duodenal), M-W tear, malignancy.
   - Continue octreotide gtt x 3 days and pantoprazole gtt for now
   - D/c prednisone
   - Active T&S, q6h Hct, trend coags, transfuse for goal Hct 25 (will
   give 1 unit pRBCs now)
   - Goal INR < 2.0 (will give 1 unit FFP now)
   - Keep NPO for now, consider clears in AM if stable
   - Ceftriaxone for SBP ppx and possible role in clot stabilization
   - If re-bleeds, would need to consider TIPS (will alert IR)
   - Appreciate Liver recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic liver failure: Most consistent with EtOH etiology.
   Does have some synthetic function, significant ascites (reaccumulation
   despite 3L para on [**4-14**]), portal hypertension, and now evidence of
   esophageal varices.
   - Monitor LFTs, coags
   - D/c prednisone as above
   - Continue pentoxyfilline for now; confirm with Liver
   - F/u liver bx
   - Consider therapeutic paracentesis
   - Hold diuretics for now
   - NPO for now but low Na when resumes diets
   - Check bladder pressure
 may require repeat paracentesis if elevated
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: This is mostly likely from acute hepatitis,
   prednisone; [**2186-4-15**] urine cx now growing E. coli. C. diff negative.
   [**4-14**] paracentesis not c/w SBP
   - Cont ceftriaxone for SBP ppx and to cover UTI
   - F/u micro
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely due to liver failure with hypovolemia, improving
   - Cont to monitor on fluid restriction
   - F/u renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # ETOH use: No evidence with withdrawal now.
   - Monitor for withdrawal symptoms
   - Resume MVI, thiamine, folate when able to take PO
   - Social work has been consulted
   # AMS: Likely secondary to sedation from morphine this AM. No evidence
   of encephalopathy, but if pt becomes confused or develops asterixis,
   would consider lactulose PO/PR.
   - Will monitor over course of day, adjust pain meds PRN
   # Tachycardia: Possibly related to blood loss/hypovolemia as well as
   component of pain.
   - Will monitor after transfusions

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old woman with acute-on-chronic liver failure, significant hematemesis, and s/p banding of esophageal varices. She has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to treat bleeding. The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, with a heart rate of 107 bpm and a blood pressure of 133/84 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 14.1-14.6 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 26.9-26.6%
* Plt: 156-109 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 0.6-0.7 mg/dL
* TCO2: 31 mmol/L
* Glucose: 134-142 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 19.9/33.1/1.8, ALT/AST: 33/103 IU/L, Alk Phos/T Bili: 94/21.8 IU/L, Differential-Neuts: 84.0%, Band: 1.0%, Lymph: 9.0%, Mono: 5.0%, Eos: 0.0%, Fibrinogen: 81 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 1.5 mmol/L, LDH: 320 IU/L, Ca++: 8.7 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.6 mg/dL, PO4: 1.9 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Somnolent this morning after morphine, oriented
* Sclera icteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
* Supple neck, JVP not elevated, no LAD
* Bibasilar crackles in the lungs
* Regular rate and rhythm, II/VI systolic murmur at RUSB
* Very distended abdomen with positive fluid wave, nontender, normoactive BS
* Warm, well-perfused extremities, 2+ pulses, no LE edema
* CNs II-XII grossly intact, no asterixis

The patient's medical complications include:

* Acute-on-chronic liver failure
* Significant hematemesis
* Leukocytosis/fever
* Hyponatremia
* AMS (likely secondary to sedation from morphine)
* Tachycardia (possibly related to blood loss/hypovolemia as well as pain)

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further bleeding
* Development of encephalopathy
* Increased risk of infections due to immunosuppression
* Kidney injury or failure due to liver failure and hypovolemia
* Respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema or ARDS
* Cardiovascular instability due to hypovolemia and electrolyte imbalances
* Neurological complications due to liver failure and AMS
* Increased risk of sepsis and multi-organ failure

Based on the patient's condition, the plan is to:

* Continue octreotide gtt x 3 days and pantoprazole gtt for now
* D/c prednisone
* Active T&S, q6h Hct, trend coags, transfuse for goal Hct 25
* Goal INR < 2.0
* Keep NPO for now, consider clears in AM if stable
* Ceftriaxone for SBP ppx and possible role in clot stabilization

   varices (visualization impaired by clotted blood), PUD (gastric or
   duodenal), M-W tear, malignancy.
   - Continue octreotide gtt x 3 days (day 1 = [**4-16**]) and pantoprazole gtt
   for now
   - Prednisone discontinued per liver team as may increase bleeding
   - Active T&S, q6h Hct, trend coags, transfuse for goal Hct 25
   (transfuse 1 unit now [**4-18**] am)
   - Transfuse FFP for goal INR < 2.0
   - Keep NPO for now; ADAT by mental status
   - Ceftriaxone for SBP ppx and possible role in clot stabilization (day

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old woman with acute and chronic liver failure, who presented with significant hematemesis and was found to have esophageal varices. She has received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) since admission, with ongoing bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 107 beats per minute, blood pressure of 133/84 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 92%. She has a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F) and a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute.

The patient's physical examination reveals scleral icterus, dry mucous membranes, and multiple telangiectasias on the face. Her abdomen is distended with a positive fluid wave, and she has a normoactive bowel sound.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.1 K/μL, hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 156 K/μL. Her liver function tests are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 103 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 33 U/L. Her international normalized ratio (INR) is 1.8, and her partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is 33.1 seconds.

The patient has a diagnosis of acute on chronic liver failure, likely secondary to ethanol use, and has evidence of portal hypertension and esophageal varices. She is at risk for further bleeding, and the team is considering the placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) if she re-bleeds.

The patient is also at risk for developing sepsis, given her elevated white blood cell count and fever. She has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is receiving antibiotics for this.

The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a sodium level of 134 mmol/L and a potassium level of 4.1 mmol/L. She is at risk for developing hyponatremia and hypokalemia.

The patient is receiving octreotide and pantoprazole to manage her bleeding and gastric acid suppression, respectively. She is also receiving ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis and to cover her UTI.

The patient's plan includes continuing octreotide and pantoprazole, transfusing PRBC and FFP as needed, and monitoring her liver function tests and coagulation studies. She will also receive lactulose to manage her encephalopathy and will be monitored for signs of withdrawal.

The patient's potential medical complications include further bleeding, sepsis, and liver failure. She is at risk for developing a variety of infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections. She is also at risk for developing gastrointestinal bleeding, including bleeding from esophageal varices and gastric ulcers."

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo woman with acute v. acute on chronic liver failure p/w
   significant hematemesis, s/p banding of esophageal varices.
   .
   # Hematemesis: Source appears to be esophageal varices based on EGD,
   now s/p banding x 4 without further evidence of active bleed. Has
   received 5 units pRBC total since [**4-16**] (including 3 during morning of
   [**4-17**]), 6u FFP, 2u cryo.  Remains HD stable. Ddx includes gastric
   varices (visualization impaired by clotted blood), PUD (gastric or
   duodenal), M-W tear, malignancy.
   - Continue octreotide gtt x 3 days (day 1 = [**4-16**]) and pantoprazole gtt
   for now
   - Prednisone discontinued per liver team as may increase bleeding
   - Active T&S, q6h Hct, trend coags, transfuse for goal Hct 25
   - Transfuse FFP for goal INR < 2.0
   - Keep NPO for now; ADAT by mental status
   - Ceftriaxone for SBP ppx and possible role in clot stabilization (day
   1 = [**4-16**])
   - If re-bleeds, would need to consider TIPS (IR evaluated pt on [**4-17**])
   - Appreciate Liver recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic liver failure: Most consistent with EtOH etiology.
   Does have some synthetic dysfunction, significant ascites
   (reaccumulation despite 3L paracentesis on [**4-14**]), portal hypertension,
   and now evidence of esophageal varices.
   - Monitor LFTs qd, coags [**Hospital1 **]
   - Prednisone discontinued as above
   - Continue pentoxyfilline for now (day 1 = [**4-12**])
   - F/u liver bx (pending)
   - Therapeutic paracentesis when stable followed by albumin [**6-6**] g/L of
   fluid removed
   - Hold diuretics for now
   - Low sodium diet when tolerating POs
   - Monitor bladder pressure
 may require repeat paracentesis if
   elevated (18 on [**4-17**] at 11pm)
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: This is mostly likely from acute hepatitis,
   prednisone; [**2186-4-15**] urine cx growing E. coli. C. diff negative. [**4-14**]
   paracentesis not c/w SBP.
   - Cont ceftriaxone for SBP ppx and to cover UTI (day 1 = [**4-16**]) for 3
   day course for UTI (Foley inserted [**4-17**])
   - F/u micro
   .

   - Cont to monitor on fluid restriction
   - Appreciate renal recs; team has now signed off.
   - Daily electrolytes
   .
   # ETOH use: No evidence for withdrawal now.
   - Monitor for withdrawal symptoms
   - Resume MVI, thiamine, folate when able to take PO
   - Social work has been consulted
   # AMS: Likely secondary to sedation from morphine. No evidence of
   encephalopathy at present.
   - Lactulose PO/PR.
   - Will monitor over course of day, adjust pain meds PRN
   # Tachycardia: Likely related to blood loss/hypovolemia as well as
   component of pain. Concern for occult infection though afebrile.
   - Will monitor
   # FEN: No IVFs, monitor/replete electrolytes, NPO (when taking POs will
   use 1L fluid restriction and low sodium diet)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - During the day, large volume of melana, tachy to 130s. Transfused 3U
   PRBC (6 units total since [**4-16**]), 4u FFP, 2u cryo. Unclear if new
   bleeding or old from overnight (have to assume it new). Hepatology has
   no plans to re-scope or place [**Last Name (un) 1048**] if opens up. IR called to
   evaluate for urgent TIPS. HCT stabilized after transfusions so plan to
   manage conservatively for now.
   - GI recs: Lactulose PO/PR (start with PR enemas and progress to PO
   once mental status improves); advance diet as tolerated according to
   mental status; when stable, patient should undergo paracentesis
   (therapeutic) followed by albumin [**6-6**] g/L of fluid removed; continue
   PPI; continue ceftriaxone; Dobhoff tube if unable to tolerate PO diet;

Summary:

The patient is a 41-year-old woman with acute-on-chronic liver failure, who presented with significant hematemesis and was found to have esophageal varices. She has undergone banding of esophageal varices and has received 5 units of packed red blood cells, 6 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 2 units of cryoprecipitate. Her hemodynamic status is stable, and she is being managed conservatively for now.

The patient has a number of ongoing medical issues, including:

* Acute-on-chronic liver failure, likely due to EtOH etiology
* Esophageal varices, which have been banded
* Significant ascites, which has been partially treated with paracentesis
* Portal hypertension
* Leukocytosis and fever, likely due to acute hepatitis and a UTI
* Hyponatremia, which has resolved
* ETOH use, which is not currently a concern
* AMS, likely secondary to sedation from morphine
* Tachycardia, which is likely related to blood loss/hypovolemia and pain

Potential medical complications:

* Re-bleeding from esophageal varices, which could require urgent TIPS
* Development of gastric varices, which could require further intervention
* Infection, particularly given the patient's leukocytosis and fever
* Hypovolemia, which could worsen the patient's hemodynamic status
* Encephalopathy, which could develop if the patient's liver function worsens
* UTI, which could worsen the patient's overall condition
* Malnutrition, particularly if the patient is unable to tolerate oral intake
* Respiratory failure, particularly if the patient's ascites worsens and compresses her lungs

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to address her ongoing medical issues and prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 41-year-old woman with ETOH hepatitis and cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU with gastrointestinal bleeding, melena, and dark red emesis. She had a paracentesis, received blood transfusions, and was started on octreotide and protonix. The patient has a history of variceal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding. She is also at risk for complications such as ascites, encephalopathy, and sepsis.

1. Variceal bleeding: The patient has a history of variceal bleeding, and it is likely that the current bleeding is due to variceal rupture. She is at risk for further bleeding and may require further interventions such as endoscopy or TIPS placement.
2. Ascites: The patient has cirrhosis and is at risk for developing ascites, which can lead to respiratory compromise and other complications.
3. Encephalopathy: The patient has cirrhosis and is at risk for developing encephalopathy, which can lead to altered mental status, seizures, and coma.
4. Sepsis: The patient has a history of ETOH hepatitis and cirrhosis, which can increase her risk for developing sepsis.
5. Respiratory compromise: The patient has ascites and is at risk for developing respiratory compromise due to compression of the lungs.
6. Malnutrition: The patient has cirrhosis and is at risk for malnutrition due to impaired liver function and decreased appetite.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding, which can lead to anemia, hypovolemic shock, and other complications.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve her condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo woman with acute v. acute on chronic liver failure p/w
   significant hematemesis, s/p banding of esophageal varices.
   .
   # Hematemesis/Melena: Source appears to be esophageal varices based on
   EGD, now s/p banding x 4 without further evidence of active bleed. Has
   received 6 units pRBC total since [**4-16**] (including 3 during morning of
   [**4-17**], none [**2097-4-17**]), 6u FFP, 2u cryo.  Remains HD stable. Ddx includes
   gastric varices (visualization impaired by clotted blood), PUD (gastric
   or duodenal), M-W tear, malignancy.
   - Continue octreotide gtt (day 1 = [**4-16**]) and pantoprazole gtt per liver
   team
   - Prednisone discontinued per liver team as may increase bleeding
   - Active T&S, q8h Hct, trend coags, transfuse for goal Hct 25
   - Transfuse FFP for goal INR < 2.0
   - ADAT by mental status (now taking sips)
   - Ceftriaxone for SBP ppx and possible role in clot stabilization (day
   1 = [**4-16**])
   - If re-bleeds, would need to consider TIPS (IR evaluated pt on [**4-17**])
   - Appreciate Liver recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic liver failure: Most consistent with EtOH etiology.
   Does have some synthetic dysfunction, significant ascites
   (reaccumulation despite 3L paracentesis on [**4-14**]), portal hypertension,
   and now evidence of esophageal varices.
   - Monitor LFTs qd, coags [**Hospital1 **]
   - [**4-19**]: MELD 24, discriminant function 56
   - Prednisone discontinued due to risk of bleeding
   - Continue pentoxyfilline (day 1 = [**4-12**]), rifaximin, lactulose
   - F/u liver bx (pending)
   - Therapeutic paracentesis when stable followed by albumin [**6-6**] g/L of
   fluid removed
   - Hold diuretics for now
   - Low sodium diet when tolerating POs
   - Monitor bladder pressure
 may require repeat paracentesis if
   elevated (18 on [**4-17**] at 11pm; 16 on [**4-18**] at 6pm)
   .
   # Leukocytosis/fever: This is mostly likely from acute hepatitis,
   prednisone; [**2186-4-15**] urine cx growing E. coli. C. diff negative. [**4-14**]
   paracentesis not c/w SBP. Leukocytosis continues [**4-19**] despite stopping
   prednisone and appropriate treatment for UTI.
   - Cont ceftriaxone for SBP ppx and to cover UTI (day 1 = [**4-16**]) for 3
   day course for UTI (Foley inserted [**4-17**])
   - F/u micro
   - CIS
   - Check C. diff
   .
   # Altered sodium balance: Initially hyponatremic, then resolved, Na 146
   on [**4-19**]. Free water deficit calculated at 2L.
   - Pt thirsty, will give PO water as tolerated by mental status and
   otherwise start 1L NS 100cc/hr
   - Low-sodium diet when advanced
   - Appreciate renal recs; team has now signed off
   - Daily electrolytes
   .
   # ETOH use: No evidence for withdrawal now.
   - Monitor for withdrawal symptoms
   - Resume MVI, thiamine, folate when able to take PO
   - Social work input appreciated
   .
   # AMS: Likely hepatic encephalopathy in setting of hepatic dysfunction.
   - Lactulose PO/PR, rifaximin
   - Will monitor over course of day, adjust pain meds PRN
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely related to blood loss/hypovolemia as well as
   component of pain. Concern for occult infection though afebrile.
   - Will monitor
   # FEN: IVFs, monitor/replete electrolytes, advance diet as tolerate by
   mental status, now on clears (starting)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Ascites fluid: NGTD (anaerobic is still preliminary)

**Assessment and Plan:**

* Continue octreotide and pantoprazole infusions per liver team
* Discontinue prednisone per liver team
* Monitor Hct and trend coags, transfuse for goal Hct 25
* Transfuse FFP for goal INR < 2.0
* Continue ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis and possible role in clot stabilization
* If re-bleeds, consider TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) with IR evaluation
* Monitor LFTs daily, coags, and electrolytes
* Continue pentoxyfilline and folic acid
* Hold diuretics for now
* Low sodium diet when tolerating POs
* Monitor bladder pressure

* Re-bleeding from esophageal varices
* Hepatic encephalopathy
* Infection (UTI, pneumonia, or sepsis)
* Fluid and electrolyte imbalance
* Renal dysfunction
* Hypovolemic shock
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias

**Recommendations:**

* Continue close monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic status, liver function, and electrolyte levels
* Consider repeating paracentesis if bladder pressure remains elevated
* Continue prophylactic antibiotics for SBP and UTI
* Monitor for signs of hepatic encephalopathy and adjust lactulose and rifaximin dosages as needed
* Consider switching to a low-sodium diet when the patient is tolerating POs
* Monitor for signs of withdrawal from ethanol use
* Continue stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole
* Monitor for signs of infection and adjust antibiotics as needed
* Consider repeat imaging studies (e.g., CT or MRI) to evaluate the patient's liver and portal hypertension."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I will summarize the patient's condition and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 41-year-old woman with acute-on-chronic liver failure, significant hematemesis, and s/p banding of esophageal varices. She has received 6 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) since admission. Her hemoglobin (Hb) has increased from 21.7 to 26.1 g/dL, but she remains hemodynamically stable. The patient has also received octreotide and pantoprazole infusions to manage bleeding and gastric acid production.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Rebleeding:** The patient's esophageal varices may continue to bleed, leading to further hematemesis and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. **Infection:** The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is at risk for sepsis, particularly with her compromised liver function and recent use of antibiotics.
3. **Hepatic Encephalopathy:** The patient's liver dysfunction may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status, confusion, and coma.
4. **Renal Failure:** The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) may progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not managed properly.
5. **Electrolyte Imbalance:** The patient's altered sodium balance and potential for fluid overload may lead to electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyponatremia.
6. **Coagulopathy:** The patient's liver dysfunction may lead to coagulopathy, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
7. **Pulmonary Complications:** The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to her underlying liver disease and potential for aspiration.
8. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient's gastrointestinal tract may become further compromised due to her liver disease, leading to malnutrition and potential for further bleeding.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic status and bleeding risk.
2. Manage the patient's UTI promptly and effectively to prevent sepsis.
3. Monitor the patient's liver function and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Manage the patient's electrolyte imbalances and fluid status carefully to prevent further complications.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulation profile and bleeding risk.
6. Consider transferring the patient to a liver transplant center if her condition does not improve with current treatment.
7. Consider adjusting the patient's medication regimen to minimize the risk of bleeding and electrolyte imbalances."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 41-year-old woman with ETOH hepatitis and variceal bleeding who has been stable with stable Hct for 48 hours. She has been oriented and doing better today. She has been receiving octreotide and pantoprazole infusions, as well as other medications such as morphine, trental, thiamin, and lactulose. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, and blood pressure of 107/65 mmHg. She has a SpO2 of 94% and is receiving oxygen therapy.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient has a history of variceal bleeding, which can recur if the underlying causes are not addressed.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of encephalopathy, which can be exacerbated by liver disease and other factors.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of E. coli infection, which can lead to sepsis and other complications.
4. Liver disease: The patient has ETOH hepatitis, which can lead to liver failure and other complications.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of coagulopathy, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, which can be exacerbated by blood loss and other factors.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by pneumonia and other complications.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of cardiovascular disease, which can lead to complications such as heart failure and arrhythmias.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is essential to monitor her closely for any signs of bleeding, encephalopathy, infection, liver disease, coagulopathy, anemia, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular complications."
