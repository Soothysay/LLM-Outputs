   #.
 .H/O HEMORRHAGE/HEMATOMA, PROCEDURE-RELATED (E.G., CATH,
   PACEMAKER, ICD BLEED) : Most likely source of bleeding is
   intra-abdominal secondary to recent surgery.  The patient is guaiac
   positive, however does not have evidence of frank GI bleed, and has
   hemorrhoids on rectal exam.  She had a CT abdomen which showed
   perihepatic fluid and focus of fluid at the surgical site, which likely
   accounts for her Hct drop.
   - NPO for now as she may require surgical intervention
   - Monitor Q4H Hct
   - Transfuse for Hct < 28, receiving 3^rd unit this AM
   - Monitor for signs of hemodynamic compromise and treat with IV fluids
   PRN
   - IV PPI for prophylaxis, although less likely to have GI bleed

   #.  S/P right laparascopic adrenalectomy:  Secondary to non-hormone
   secreting tumor (4cm) per previous endocrine workup.  Will follow
   pathology, pending currently.  Will follow recommendations from primary
   general surgery team.  Monitor for signs of adrenal insufficiency,
   however should be unlikely given no intervention to L adrenal.
   - Morphine for pain control, however will attempt to decrease doses
   given signs of ileus on exam.
   .
   #.  Elevated Temp:  The patient is not currently febrile, however
   differential for elevated temp in post-op patient include atelecatsis,
   infection or inflammatory reaction.  Most likely in this patient is
   atelectasis given decreased O2 on RA and evidence of atelectasis at
   bases on CT abd.  However, will monitor for signs of infection.  If the
   patient develops a higher temp (>101.5), will pan culture at that time.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female who underwent right adrenalectomy for a non-hormone secreting tumor and is currently admitted to the ICU for anemia. She has a history of papillary thyroid carcinoma, hypertension, impaired glucose intolerance, and hypothyroidism. She is currently receiving blood transfusions due to a drop in her hemoglobin level, and her hemodynamic monitoring shows a stable blood pressure and heart rate. Her respiratory support is minimal, and she is not receiving oxygen therapy. Her physical examination shows signs of ileus, and her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count and a decreased platelet count.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhage/ Hematoma: The patient has a high risk of bleeding due to her recent surgery and the presence of perihepatic fluid and a focus of fluid at the surgical site.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection, particularly in the surgical site, given the presence of perihepatic fluid and a focus of fluid at the surgical site.
3. Atelectasis: The patient has signs of atelectasis on her CT scan, which may be contributing to her elevated temperature.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of papillary thyroid carcinoma and has undergone thyroidectomy and ablation. She is at risk of developing hypothyroidism.
5. Hypocalemia: The patient has hypoparathyroidism and is at risk of developing hypocalemia.
6. Impaired glucose tolerance: The patient has impaired glucose tolerance and is at risk of developing hyperglycemia.
7. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is at risk of developing hypertension again.
8. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has undergone right adrenalectomy and is at risk of developing adrenal insufficiency.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's hemodynamic status closely and treat any signs of bleeding or hypovolemia.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and treat any signs of atelectasis or pneumonia.
3. Start a bowel regimen to prevent ileus and promote bowel movement.
4. Monitor the patient's temperature and treat any signs of infection.
5. Restart home levothyroxine and calcium supplementation when the patient is taking oral medications.
6. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and treat any signs of hyperglycemia.
7. Restart home medications for hypertension when the patient is taking oral medications.
8. Monitor the patient's adrenal function and treat any signs of adrenal insufficiency."

   47 yo female with history of papillary thyroid carcinoma, hypertension,
   impaired glucose intolerance POD 1 of right adrenalectomy for
   non-hormone secreting tumor admitted for anemia.
   .
   #.
 .H/O HEMORRHAGE/HEMATOMA, PROCEDURE-RELATED (E.G., CATH,
   PACEMAKER, ICD BLEED) : Most likely source of bleeding is
   intra-abdominal secondary to recent surgery.  The patient is guaiac
   positive, however does not have evidence of frank GI bleed, and has
   hemorrhoids on rectal exam.  She had a CT abdomen which showed
   perihepatic fluid and focus of fluid at the surgical site, which likely
   accounts for her Hct drop.
   - NPO for now as she may require surgical intervention
   - Monitor Q4H Hct
   - Monitor for signs of hemodynamic compromise and treat with IV fluids
   PRN
   - IV PPI for prophylaxis, although less likely to have GI bleed
   - f/u final read CT
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   .
   #.  S/P right laparascopic adrenalectomy:  Secondary to non-hormone
   secreting tumor (4cm) per previous endocrine workup.  Will follow
   pathology, pending currently.  Will follow recommendations from primary
   general surgery team.  Monitor for signs of adrenal insufficiency,
   however should be unlikely given no intervention to L adrenal.
   - Morphine for pain control, however will attempt to decrease doses
   given signs of ileus on exam.
   .
   #.  Elevated Temp:  The patient is not currently febrile, however
   differential for elevated temp in post-op patient include atelecatsis,
   infection or inflammatory reaction.  Most likely in this patient is
   atelectasis given decreased O2 on RA and evidence of atelectasis at
   bases on CT abd.  However, will monitor for signs of infection.  If the
   patient develops a higher temp (>101.5), will pan culture at that time.
   - Incentive spirometry
   .
   #.  Hypothyroidism:  S/p thyroidectomy and ablation for papillary
   thyroid cancer.  When taking POs will restart home levothyroxine dose,
   137mcg.
   .
   #.  Hypocalemia:  Secondary to hypoparathyroidism.  Will restart home
   calcium supplementation when taking POs.
   .
   #.  Impaired glucose tolerance:  Likely pre-diabetic.  Will monitor for
   signs of hyperglycemia and treat with insulin SS.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female who underwent right adrenalectomy for a non-hormone secreting tumor and is currently admitted to the ICU for anemia. She has a history of papillary thyroid carcinoma, hypertension, and impaired glucose intolerance. She has been experiencing nausea and dry heaves, and was given zofran IV. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 143/81 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute. She has a slight decrease in hemoglobin level, and her blood products have been transfused.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient has a history of hemorrhage and hematoma, and her recent surgery may have caused bleeding. Her hemoglobin level has decreased, and she may require further transfusions.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated temperature may be due to atelectasis, infection, or inflammatory reaction. She should be monitored for signs of infection, and if her temperature increases to >101.5°C, she should be pan-cultured.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of papillary thyroid cancer and has undergone thyroidectomy and ablation. She will need to restart her home levothyroxine dose when taking POs.
4. Hypocalemia: The patient has hypoparathyroidism and will need to restart her home calcium supplementation when taking POs.
5. Impaired glucose tolerance: The patient is likely pre-diabetic and should be monitored for signs of hyperglycemia. She should be treated with insulin SS as needed.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently well-controlled off her home medications. She should be monitored and restarted on her medications when taking POs.
7. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of hemorrhoids and has been guaiac positive. She should be monitored for signs of GI bleeding.
8. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has undergone right laparoscopic adrenalectomy and should be monitored for signs of adrenal insufficiency."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old overweight female admitted to the ICU with a history of hemorrhage and hematoma related to a surgical procedure. She received 2 units of blood overnight, with her hemoglobin level increasing from 24.3 to 27.2. She is currently receiving insulin for glycemic control and is being monitored for potential complications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, and blood pressure of 143/81 mmHg. Her respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 97% and no oxygen therapy required.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's history of hemorrhage and hematoma increases the risk of further bleeding complications, particularly with the presence of a small focus of hyperdensity adjacent to the surgical bed, which may represent a surgical staple or a small venous or arterial bleed.
2. Infection: The patient's surgical site and the presence of a possible subcapsular hematoma at the right inferior border of the liver increase the risk of infection.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is negative, with a total outflow of 2,700 mL and a total inflow of 1,624 mL, which may indicate dehydration or fluid overload.
4. Respiratory compromise: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the presence of a possible subcapsular hematoma at the right inferior border of the liver may increase the risk of respiratory compromise if the hematoma expands or compresses the surrounding structures.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of hemorrhage and hematoma may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation, particularly if the patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of hemorrhage and hematoma may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac tamponade or pericardial effusion, particularly if the patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of hemorrhage and hematoma may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or cerebral edema, particularly if the patient is experiencing increased intracranial pressure."

   Assessment and Plan
   47 yo female with history of papillary thyroid carcinoma, hypertension,
   impaired glucose intolerance POD 1 of right adrenalectomy for
   non-hormone secreting tumor admitted for anemia.
   .
   #.
 .H/O HEMORRHAGE/HEMATOMA, PROCEDURE-RELATED (E.G., CATH,
   PACEMAKER, ICD BLEED) : Most likely source of bleeding is
   intra-abdominal secondary to recent surgery.  The patient is guaiac
   positive, however does not have evidence of frank GI bleed, and has
   hemorrhoids on rectal exam.  She had a CT abdomen which showed
   perihepatic fluid and focus of fluid at the surgical site, which likely
   accounts for her Hct drop.
   - NPO for now as she may require surgical intervention
   - Monitor Q4H Hct, will space out checks if next hct stable
   - Monitor for signs of hemodynamic compromise and treat with IV fluids
   boluses PRN
   - IV PPI for prophylaxis, although less likely to have GI bleed
   - f/u final read CT
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   .
   #.  S/P right laparascopic adrenalectomy:  Secondary to non-hormone
   secreting tumor (4cm) per previous endocrine workup.  Will follow
   pathology, pending currently.  Will follow recommendations from primary
   general surgery team.  Monitor for signs of adrenal insufficiency,
   however should be unlikely given no intervention to L adrenal.
   - Morphine for pain control, however will attempt to decrease doses
   given signs of ileus on exam.
   - Tylenol prn for fever/pain control
   .
   #.  Elevated Temp:  The patient is not currently febrile, however
   differential for elevated temp in post-op patient include atelecatsis,
   infection or inflammatory reaction.  Most likely in this patient is
   atelectasis given decreased O2 on RA and evidence of atelectasis at
   bases on CT abd.  However, will monitor for signs of infection.  If the
   patient develops a higher temp (>101.5), will pan culture at that time.
   - Incentive spirometry
   .
   #.  Hypothyroidism:  S/p thyroidectomy and ablation for papillary
   thyroid cancer.  When taking POs will restart home levothyroxine dose,
   137mcg.  Until then, can give IV synthroid.
   .
   #.  Hypocalemia:  Secondary to hypoparathyroidism.  Will restart home
   calcium supplementation when taking POs.
   .
   #.  Impaired glucose tolerance:  Likely pre-diabetic.  Will monitor for
   signs of hyperglycemia and treat with insulin SS.
   .
   #   Hypertension:  Blood pressure is currently well controlled off home
   medications. Will monitor and restart when taking POs.

   Tiny focus of hyperdensity adjacent to the surgical bed may represent

   staple; however, a small venous or arterial bleed is not excluded.
   Otherwise,
   no evidence of active extravasation. Unchanged appearance of
   high-density
   material in the surgical bed in the perihepatic, perisplenic, and
   perirenal
   space compared to the most recent CT and consistent with hematoma.
   Possible
   subcapsular hematoma at the right inferior border of the liver.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 yo female with history of papillary thyroid carcinoma, hypertension,
   impaired glucose intolerance POD 1 of right adrenalectomy for
   non-hormone secreting tumor admitted for anemia.
   .
   #.
 .H/O HEMORRHAGE/HEMATOMA, PROCEDURE-RELATED (E.G., CATH,
   PACEMAKER, ICD BLEED) : Most likely source of bleeding is
   intra-abdominal secondary to recent surgery.  The patient is guaiac
   positive, however does not have evidence of frank GI bleed, and has
   hemorrhoids on rectal exam.  She had a CT abdomen which showed
   perihepatic fluid and focus of fluid at the surgical site, which likely
   accounts for her Hct drop.
   - NPO for now as she may require surgical intervention
   - Monitor Q4H Hct, will space out checks if next hct stable
   - Monitor for signs of hemodynamic compromise and treat with IV fluids
   boluses PRN
   - IV PPI for prophylaxis, although less likely to have GI bleed
   - f/u final read CT
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   .
   #.  S/P right laparascopic adrenalectomy:  Secondary to non-hormone
   secreting tumor (4cm) per previous endocrine workup.  Will follow
   pathology, pending currently.  Will follow recommendations from primary
   general surgery team.  Monitor for signs of adrenal insufficiency,
   however should be unlikely given no intervention to L adrenal.
   - Morphine for pain control, however will attempt to decrease doses
   given signs of ileus on exam.
   - Tylenol prn for fever/pain control
   .
   #.  Elevated Temp:  The patient is not currently febrile, however
   differential for elevated temp in post-op patient include atelecatsis,
   infection or inflammatory reaction.  Most likely in this patient is
   atelectasis given decreased O2 on RA and evidence of atelectasis at
   bases on CT abd.  However, will monitor for signs of infection.  If the
   patient develops a higher temp (>101.5), will pan culture at that time.
   - Incentive spirometry
   .
   #.  Hypothyroidism:  S/p thyroidectomy and ablation for papillary
   thyroid cancer.  When taking POs will restart home levothyroxine dose,
   137mcg.  Until then, can give IV synthroid.
   .
   #.  Hypocalemia:  Secondary to hypoparathyroidism.  Will restart home
   calcium supplementation when taking POs.
   .
   #.  Impaired glucose tolerance:  Likely pre-diabetic.  Will monitor for
   signs of hyperglycemia and treat with insulin SS.
   .
   #   Hypertension:  Blood pressure is currently well controlled off home
   medications. Will monitor and restart when taking POs.

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female who underwent right adrenalectomy for a non-hormone secreting tumor. She was admitted for anemia and has a history of papillary thyroid carcinoma, hypertension, impaired glucose intolerance, and hypothyroidism. She has been experiencing nausea, dry heaves, and RUQ pain, which were managed with zofran and morphine. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, and blood pressure of 143/81 mmHg. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a slight increase in total blood volume over the past 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhage/ Hematoma: The patient's Hct drop and CT abdomen showing perihepatic fluid and focus of fluid at the surgical site suggest intra-abdominal bleeding as the most likely source. The patient may require surgical intervention.
2. GI Bleed: The patient is guaiac positive, but does not have evidence of frank GI bleed. However, she has hemorrhoids on rectal exam, which could lead to bleeding.
3. Atelectasis: The patient's decreased O2 saturation and evidence of atelectasis at the bases on CT abdomen suggest the possibility of atelectasis.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated temperature could be due to infection, inflammatory reaction, or atelectasis. If the temperature increases to >101.5°C, a pan culture will be performed.
5. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient may be at risk for adrenal insufficiency due to the removal of the right adrenal gland. Monitoring for signs of adrenal insufficiency is necessary.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is managed with IV synthroid, but will require restarting home levothyroxine dose when taking POs.
7. Hypocalemia: The patient's hypocalemia is secondary to hypoparathyroidism and will require restarting home calcium supplementation when taking POs.
8. Impaired Glucose Tolerance: The patient's impaired glucose tolerance may lead to hyperglycemia, which will require treatment with insulin SS.
9. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently well-controlled off home medications, but will require restarting when taking POs."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of thyroid carcinoma and recent elective adrenalectomy. She experienced a critical drop in hemoglobin on post-operative day 1 and is suspected to have a liver lac during surgery. She has been receiving PRBC transfusions and is currently receiving pantoprazole and morphine for nausea and abdominal pain. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, and blood pressure of 128/85 mmHg. She has a SpO2 of 96% and is receiving oxygen therapy. Her laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, white blood cell count of 8.5 K/uL, and platelet count of 159 K/uL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Intra-abdominal bleed: The patient's critical drop in hemoglobin and suspected liver lac during surgery increase the risk of intra-abdominal bleeding, which can lead to further hemodynamic instability and organ failure.
2. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of thyroid carcinoma and recent adrenalectomy increase the risk of hypothyroidism, which can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance.
3. Hypoparathyroidism: The patient's history of thyroid carcinoma and recent adrenalectomy also increase the risk of hypoparathyroidism, which can lead to symptoms such as muscle weakness, cramping, and tingling.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support with oxygen therapy and ABG results of 7.26% increase the risk of respiratory failure, particularly in the setting of post-operative respiratory complications.
5. Infection: The patient's low-grade temperature and guaiac-positive stool increase the risk of infection, particularly in the setting of post-operative sepsis.
6. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance data shows a negative balance of 1,077 mL, which may indicate inadequate fluid resuscitation or ongoing fluid losses, potentially leading to hypovolemic shock.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal pain, nausea, and dry heaves increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, particularly in the setting of post-operative ileus or bowel obstruction."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -started IV Levothyroxine
   -Hct drop in am to 21, received 2U PRBC, back to OR, took out clots and
   saw one site of active bleeding.  Was tranfsued one additional U of
   PRBC.  Went from 21.1 to 37.4 then down to 36.3 then 35.8 post op.
   -was reintubated in PACU for tachypnea.  plan to stay intubated until
   am.  Was changed from PS to AC in ICU due to aggitation and need for
   more sedation with bolused fentanyl. On AC 440/16/5/.50 ABG was
   7.39/38/164 so decreased to .40.
   -repleted K and Calcium (quite low), and Mg
   -increasing WBC so sent diff
   -spike to 101.3 at m/n, sent urine and blood.  were considering
   starting vanc/zosyn but surgery felt would hold for now.
   -ET tube was placed too far.  Withdrawn multiple times and at m/n 1 cm
   above carina.

   Assessment and Plan
   47 yo female with history of papillary thyroid carcinoma, hypertension,
   impaired glucose intolerance POD 1 of right adrenalectomy for
   non-hormone secreting tumor admitted for anemia.
   .
   #.
 .H/O HEMORRHAGE/HEMATOMA, PROCEDURE-RELATED (E.G., CATH,
   PACEMAKER, ICD BLEED) : Most likely source of bleeding is
   intra-abdominal secondary to recent surgery.  The patient is guaiac
   positive, however does not have evidence of frank GI bleed, and has
   hemorrhoids on rectal exam.  She had a CT abdomen which showed
   perihepatic fluid and focus of fluid at the surgical site, which likely
   accounts for her Hct drop.
   - NPO for now as she may require surgical intervention
   - Monitor Q4H Hct, will space out checks if next hct stable
   - Monitor for signs of hemodynamic compromise and treat with IV fluids
   boluses PRN
   - IV PPI for prophylaxis, although less likely to have GI bleed
   - f/u final read CT
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   .
   #.  S/P right laparascopic adrenalectomy:  Secondary to non-hormone
   secreting tumor (4cm) per previous endocrine workup.  Will follow
   pathology, pending currently.  Will follow recommendations from primary
   general surgery team.  Monitor for signs of adrenal insufficiency,
   however should be unlikely given no intervention to L adrenal.
   - Morphine for pain control, however will attempt to decrease doses
   given signs of ileus on exam.
   - Tylenol prn for fever/pain control
   .
   #.  Elevated Temp:  The patient is not currently febrile, however
   differential for elevated temp in post-op patient include atelecatsis,
   infection or inflammatory reaction.  Most likely in this patient is
   atelectasis given decreased O2 on RA and evidence of atelectasis at
   bases on CT abd.  However, will monitor for signs of infection.  If the
   patient develops a higher temp (>101.5), will pan culture at that time.
   - Incentive spirometry
   .
   #.  Hypothyroidism:  S/p thyroidectomy and ablation for papillary
   thyroid cancer.  When taking POs will restart home levothyroxine dose,
   137mcg.  Until then, can give IV synthroid.
   .
   #.  Hypocalemia:  Secondary to hypoparathyroidism.  Will restart home
   calcium supplementation when taking POs.
   .
   #.  Impaired glucose tolerance:  Likely pre-diabetic.  Will monitor for
   signs of hyperglycemia and treat with insulin SS.
   .
   #   Hypertension:  Blood pressure is currently well controlled off home
   medications. Will monitor and restart when taking POs.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   intra-abdominal secondary to recent surgery.  The patient is guaiac
   positive, however does not have evidence of frank GI bleed, and has
   hemorrhoids on rectal exam.  She had a CT abdomen which showed
   perihepatic fluid and focus of fluid at the surgical site, which likely
   accounts for her Hct drop.
   - NPO for now as she may require surgical intervention
   - Monitor Q4H Hct, will space out checks if next hct stable
   - Monitor for signs of hemodynamic compromise and treat with IV fluids

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female who underwent a right adrenalectomy for a non-hormone secreting tumor and is currently admitted to the ICU for anemia.

The patient has had several complications since admission, including:

1. Hemorrhage: The patient had a significant drop in hemoglobin level, which was attributed to intra-abdominal bleeding secondary to the recent surgery. The patient was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells and had an additional unit transfused after the bleeding site was identified.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient was reintubated in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) due to tachypnea and was placed on assisted ventilation. The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but the patient is at risk for further respiratory complications due to the recent surgery and potential atelectasis.
3. Fever: The patient's temperature spiked to 101.3°F, which may be attributed to atelectasis, infection, or inflammatory reaction. The patient's temperature is currently under control with acetaminophen and the patient is being monitored for signs of infection.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient is hypothyroid due to the thyroidectomy and ablation for papillary thyroid cancer. The patient is being treated with IV levothyroxine and will restart home medications when taking oral medications.
5. Hypocalcemia: The patient has hypocalcemia secondary to hypoparathyroidism. The patient will restart home calcium supplementation when taking oral medications.
6. Impaired glucose tolerance: The patient has impaired glucose tolerance and is at risk for hyperglycemia. The patient is being monitored and treated with insulin as needed.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently well-controlled off home medications, but the patient will restart medications when taking oral medications.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.1°F
* Heart rate: 99 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 142/83 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's lab results show:

* Hemoglobin: 35.8%
* Platelet count: 169,000/μL
* White blood cell count: 10.2 K/μL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 24 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 95 mg/dL
* Calcium: 7.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 4.1 mg/dL

The patient's plan of care includes:

* NPO status for now, with repletion of electrolytes as needed
* Monitoring of hemodynamic status and treatment with IV fluids and blood products as needed
* Prophylaxis for stress ulcer with IV pantoprazole
* Monitoring for signs of infection and treatment with antibiotics if necessary
* Restart of home medications when taking oral medications
* Close communication with the patient and her husband regarding the patient's status and plan of care.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further bleeding or hemorrhage
* Respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome
* Infection or sepsis
* Hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis
* Hypocalcemia or hypoparathyroidism
* Hypothyroidism or thyroid storm
* Adrenal insufficiency or crisis
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female who underwent right adrenalectomy for a non-hormone secreting tumor. She was admitted for anemia, POD 1, following re-exploration for post-op bleeding. The patient's condition is complex, with multiple potential complications arising from the surgery and underlying medical conditions.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Hemodynamically stable, with a stable Hct and no signs of hemodynamic compromise
* Fever spike to 101.3°F, with pending blood and urine cultures
* Elevated WBC count, with a differential showing a significant neutrophilic response
* Hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia, likely secondary to hypoparathyroidism
* Impaired glucose tolerance, likely pre-diabetic
* Hypertension, currently well-controlled off home medications

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's fever and elevated WBC count
* Respiratory failure due to atelectasis or pneumonia
* Cardiac complications due to hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia
* Adrenal insufficiency due to the recent adrenalectomy
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as ileus or perforation, due to the patient's recent surgery
* Hypothyroidism, which may require further management and monitoring

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitoring for signs of hemodynamic compromise and treating with IV fluids and vasopressors as needed
* Monitoring for signs of hypothyroidism and treating with IV levothyroxine as needed
* Monitoring for signs of hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia, and treating with IV calcium, magnesium, and potassium as needed
* Monitoring for signs of impaired glucose tolerance and treating with insulin SS as needed
* Monitoring for signs of hypertension and treating with antihypertensive medications as needed
* Considering the possibility of surgical intervention for the patient's bleeding complications
* Following up with the patient's primary general surgery team for further recommendations and guidance

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female who underwent right adrenalectomy for a non-hormone secreting tumor. She was admitted to the ICU due to post-operative bleeding and re-exploration. She is currently on bedrest and is being monitored for signs of hemodynamic compromise, hypothyroidism, and other potential complications.

The patient is experiencing minimal pain in the RUQ, mostly when moving or coughing, and has intermittent nausea. She has had no emesis overnight and has passed flatus and had a bowel movement this morning. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 148/77 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's laboratory results show stable hemoglobin and platelet counts, but elevated liver enzymes and alkaline phosphatase. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for hypocalcemia. She has no new imaging studies this morning.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's fever overnight could be related to recent surgery or developing pneumonia.
2. Atelectasis: The patient's fever could also be related to atelectasis in the post-operative setting.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: Although the patient did not have any intervention to the left adrenal, she is at risk for adrenal insufficiency due to the surgery.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of papillary thyroid cancer and underwent thyroidectomy and ablation. She may require thyroid hormone replacement therapy.
5. Hypocalcemia: The patient has hypoparathyroidism and may require calcium supplementation.
6. Impaired glucose tolerance: The patient has a history of impaired glucose tolerance and may require insulin therapy.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently well-controlled off home medications, but she may require restarting her medications when taking oral medications.
8. DVT: The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to her recent surgery and immobilization.
9. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for developing stress ulcer due to her recent surgery and potential bleeding.
10. VAP: The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to her recent surgery and potential respiratory complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a post-operative patient who was extubated in the morning and is currently on bedrest for three days. They are receiving morphine sulfate for pain control and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, and blood pressure of 148/77 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 99%. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 190 K/uL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level. The patient's imaging studies are negative for any abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but they are at risk for respiratory failure due to their post-operative status and potential for pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
2. Hemorrhage: The patient has a history of hemorrhage and hematoma, and is at risk for further bleeding due to their post-operative status and potential for coagulopathy.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to their post-operative status and potential for bacteremia or other infections.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but they are at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to their post-operative status and potential for electrolyte imbalances.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, or bleeding due to their post-operative status and potential for electrolyte imbalances.
6. Neurological complications: The patient is at risk for neurological complications such as seizures or stroke due to their post-operative status and potential for electrolyte imbalances or bleeding.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications due to their post-operative status and potential for coagulopathy, infection, cardiac complications, gastrointestinal complications, and neurological complications. Close monitoring and aggressive treatment are necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

   #.  S/P right laparascopic adrenalectomy:  Secondary to non-hormone
   secreting tumor (4cm) per previous endocrine workup.  Will follow
   recommendations from primary general surgery team.  Monitor for signs
   of adrenal insufficiency, however should be unlikely given no
   intervention to L adrenal.
   - Morphine for pain control, however will attempt to decrease doses
   given signs of ileus on exam.
   - Tylenol prn for fever/pain control
   - Will follow pathology, pending currently.
   #.  Elevated Temp:  Fevers overnight, likely related to recent
   surgery.  Could also be developing pneumonia, but more likely related
   to atelectasis in the post-op setting.
   - Incentive spirometry
   #.  Hypothyroidism:  S/p thyroidectomy and ablation for papillary
   thyroid cancer.  When taking POs will restart home levothyroxine dose,
   137mcg.  Until then, can give IV synthroid.
   #.  Hypocalemia:  Secondary to hypoparathyroidism.  Will restart home
   calcium supplementation when taking POs.
   #.  Impaired glucose tolerance:  Likely pre-diabetic.  Will monitor for
   signs of hyperglycemia and treat with insulin SS.
   #   Hypertension:  Blood pressure is currently well controlled off home
   medications. Will monitor and restart when taking POs.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female who underwent a right adrenalectomy for a non-hormone secreting tumor and is currently admitted to the ICU due to anemia and post-operative bleeding. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, and blood pressure of 148/77 mmHg.

The patient has a history of papillary thyroid carcinoma, hypertension, impaired glucose intolerance, and hypothyroidism. She is currently on morphine for pain control and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.5-12.2 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 12.1-12.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 157-190 x 10^9/L. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low calcium level.

The patient has been experiencing fevers overnight, which may be related to recent surgery or developing pneumonia. She is also at risk for atelectasis due to her post-operative setting.

The patient's current medications include morphine, pantoprazole, and IV fluids. She is NPO and will be discussed with surgery about advancing to clear liquids.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's fevers and risk of developing pneumonia, sepsis is a potential complication.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's risk of atelectasis and pneumonia increases her risk of respiratory failure.
3. Hemorrhage: Although the patient's bleeding has been controlled, there is still a risk of further bleeding.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's recent surgery may have affected her adrenal function, increasing her risk of adrenal insufficiency.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's recent thyroidectomy and ablation for papillary thyroid cancer increase her risk of hypothyroidism.
6. Hypocalemia: The patient's hypoparathyroidism increases her risk of hypocalemia.
7. Impaired glucose tolerance: The patient's pre-diabetic state increases her risk of developing hyperglycemia.
8. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension increases her risk of developing hypertension while in the ICU.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent or promptly manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female who underwent a right adrenalectomy for a non-hormone secreting tumor and is currently admitted to the ICU due to anemia and post-operative bleeding. She has a history of papillary thyroid carcinoma, hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, and hypothyroidism. The patient is currently NPO, receiving morphine for pain control, and is being monitored for signs of hemodynamic compromise.

Physical Examination:

* Gen: Overweight female, lying in bed, NAD, awake and alert
* CV: RRR, S1, S2, no m/r/g
* Pulm: CTAB, soft crackles at bases b/l
* Abd: Distended and firm in RUQ, slightly tender to palp in RUQ
* Extrem: No abnormalities noted

Lab Results:

* Hemoglobin: 12.1 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 33.9%
* White Blood Cell Count: 10.5-12.2 K/uL
* Platelet Count: 157-190 K/uL

* Alk Phos/T Bili: 56/1.3 IU/L
* Differential-Neuts: 81.1% Lymph: 13.8% Mono: 3.6% Eos: 1.3%

Potential Medical Complications:

* Pneumonia: Given the patient's recent surgery and fevers overnight, pneumonia is a possible complication.
* Atelectasis: The patient's symptoms of fever and cough could be related to atelectasis in the post-operative setting.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of papillary thyroid cancer and underwent thyroidectomy and ablation. She will need to restart her home levothyroxine dose when taking POs.
* Hypocalemia: The patient has hypoparathyroidism and will need to restart her home calcium supplementation when taking POs.
* Impaired glucose tolerance: The patient has a history of impaired glucose tolerance and will need to be monitored for signs of hyperglycemia and treated with insulin SS.
* Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and will need to be monitored and restarted on home medications when taking POs.

Recommendations:

* Continue NPO status until further advised by surgery
* Monitor Hct and adjust fluid management accordingly
* Monitor for signs of hemodynamic compromise and treat with IV fluids as needed
* Continue IV PPI and consider changing to PO when appropriate
* Monitor for signs of adrenal insufficiency and treat accordingly
* Continue morphine for pain control and attempt to decrease doses as tolerated
* Monitor for signs of ileus and treat with laxatives or stool softeners as needed
* Follow up with pathology and microbiology results
* Monitor for signs of infection and treat accordingly
* Consider restarting home medications when taking POs."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is receiving IV fluids and has a fluid balance of 552 mL over the past 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhagic Shock: The patient's intra-abdominal bleeding may lead to hypovolemic shock, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's postoperative status and potential atelectasis may increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's low-grade fever and positive blood culture may indicate sepsis, which can progress to severe sepsis or septic shock if not recognized and treated early.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications such as myxedema coma.
5. Impaired Glucose Tolerance: The patient's impaired glucose tolerance may increase the risk of developing hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, which can have serious consequences if not managed properly.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and postoperative status may increase the risk of DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if not prevented or treated promptly.
7. Stress Ulcer Bleeding: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis may not be sufficient to prevent bleeding, which can lead to gastrointestinal hemorrhage and shock.
8. Infection: The patient's positive blood culture and potential atelectasis may indicate infection, which can spread to other parts of the body and cause serious complications if not treated promptly.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust management accordingly to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, hypertension, and glucose intolerance. She underwent elective resection of an adrenal adenoma and subsequently developed a liver bleed, requiring reoperation.

The patient is currently in the ICU, four days post-operatively, and has been extubated. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 91 beats per minute, blood pressure of 148/77 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute.

The patient's physical examination is significant for right lower extremity edema (1+), left lower extremity edema (1+), and soft, bowel sounds present but decreased, with mildly distended abdomen and tender surgical sites. Neurologically, the patient is attentive and follows simple commands.

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 12.1 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 37.4%
* Platelet count: 156-190 x 10^9/L
* White blood cell count: 9.8-11.3 x 10^9/L
* Blood urea nitrogen: 9-12 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 0.5-0.6 mg/dL
* Sodium: 137-141 mmol/L
* Potassium: 3.5-4.1 mmol/L
* Glucose: 77-112 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.7 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.0 g/dL
* LDH: 299 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.1 mg/dL

The patient's diagnosis includes postoperative bleeding, hypothyroidism, impaired glucose tolerance, and possible atelectasis. The plan includes:

* Co-managing with surgery
* Incentive spirometer
* Pneumoboots
* Pain control with morphine as needed
* Advance diet and resume PO medications
* Follow-up with pan cultures and NGTD
* Holding on empiric antibiotics
* Follow clinically

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Bleeding complications due to continued postoperative bleeding
* Respiratory complications due to possible atelectasis
* Infection due to prolonged antibiotic use
* Hypothyroidism complications due to inadequate replacement therapy
* Impaired glucose tolerance complications due to inadequate insulin therapy
* Fluid overload due to excessive fluid administration
* DVT or PE due to immobility and risk factors
* Stress ulcer due to prolonged critical illness and risk factors

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent or promptly address these potential complications."
