   Assessment and Plan
   70 year old male with known CLL presents with hemoptysis in setting of
   known LLL mass; now s/p embolization of bronchial artery.
   # Hemoptysis: patient underwent bronchoscopy complicated by massive
   bleeding from thrombus / mass lesion in LLL lobe; now s/p IR
   embolization of bronchial artery with injection of alcohol into the
   tumor. Currently Hct has been stable
   - Will monitor hct q6 (pt also with autoimmune hemolytic anemia)
   - Transfuse Hct< 25
   - If patient begins to have active bleeding, will need to intubate R.
   mainstem given site of bleed is left side; given high suspicion for
   metastatic renal cell cancer however options are limited if further
   bleeding develops, however will likely require thoracic surgery and IR
   .
   # Respiratory Distress- Patient successfully extubated, now stable on
   high flow oxygen however with embolized LLL and with persistant RUL
   collapse, contributing to dyspnea. He was extremely anxious overnight
   with concern that he may need to be re-intubated.
   -Treat anxiety prn
   -Will continue treatment for pneumonia with
   Vanc/Levo/Cefepime/Voriconazole
   .
   #CAD: Patient with profound anemia in setting of CLL, autoimmune
   hemolitic anemia and recent large volume bleed. ECG now with
   anteroseptal T wave inversions and ~1mm ST depression along inferior
   leads. Given thrombocytopenia, recent bleeding and active CLL, patient
   is not a candidate for antiplatelet therapy (aspirin / clopidogrel) and
   this likely represents a demand related event and not platelet related
   coronary thrombosis. Troponin already on way down inspite of worsening
   renal function suggesting minimal myocardial involvement.. Enzymes have
   remained flat
   - Continue metoprolol as tolerated
   - Avoid aspirin / clopidogrel / heparin
   - Transfuse to goal Hct ~25, nitrates / morphine PRN
   .
   # Fever: Temp 100.5 overnight; Unknown how long patient has been
   afebrile but patient had a week of fever prior to admission and has
   been treated by MICU/BMT teams with broad coverage given
   immunosuppressed state. Flu swab negative, U/A negative, Urine
   Legionella negative and all blood cultures to date with no growth. CXR
   and CT with concern for pneumonia vs atelectasis.  All culture data
   since [**1-9**] has been negative and NGTD on [**1-17**] and [**1-17**] surveillence
   cultures.
   -Will continue Vanc/Levo/Cefepime/ Voriconazole(need to clarify
   duration)
   -Follow up culture data
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr very elevated to 1.5 today, (baseline 1.0-1.2); unclear
   etiology at this point but may be due to hypovolemia in setting of
   massive blood loss, however this is most likely cause. Given history of
   RCC however, wou ld conisder this in working diagnosis
   - Volume resuscitate
   - Continue to trend for now
   .
   # Anemia: Patient has known AIHA related to CLL and HCT 25 from
   baseline 28-30 with increased hyperbilirubinemia possibly related to
   hemolysis with elevated TB, low haptoglobin. Transfused 1 unit PRBCs in
   ED. Had responsded appropriate to transfusion, and hct stable

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with known Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) who presented with hemoptysis and was subsequently treated with bronchoscopy and IR embolization of the bronchial artery. He has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for close monitoring and treatment. The patient's condition is complicated by autoimmune hemolytic anemia, anemia, and recent large-volume bleeding. He is also at risk for respiratory distress due to embolized left lower lobe and persistent right upper lobe collapse.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is at risk for re-intubation due to persistant right upper lobe collapse and dyspnea.
2. Bleeding: The patient has a history of massive bleeding from the thrombus/mass lesion in the left lower lobe and may require further transfusions to maintain a stable hemoglobin level.
3. Infection: The patient has a fever and is at risk for pneumonia or atelectasis, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
4. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he may require further treatment for kidney injury.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has anteroseptal T wave inversions and ST depression on ECG, which could indicate coronary thrombosis or demand-related cardiac event.
6. Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia: The patient's autoimmune hemolytic anemia may require further treatment with steroids or other medications to manage the condition.
7. Metabolic Complications: The patient has diabetes and may require further treatment for hyperglycemia.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may increase his risk for bleeding complications.
9. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require mechanical ventilation to manage his respiratory distress.
10. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his immunocompromised state and potential infections."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with known chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who presented with hemoptysis and was found to have a large left lower lobe (LLL) mass. He underwent bronchoscopy complicated by massive bleeding from the thrombus/mass lesion in the LLL lobe, and subsequently underwent interventional radiology (IR) embolization of the bronchial artery with injection of alcohol into the tumor.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is 115/53 mmHg, and his heart rate is 108 bpm.
* Respiratory support: The patient is on high-flow oxygen and has a SpO2 of 96%.
* Neurological status: The patient's neurological status is not assessed due to his sedation and mechanical ventilation.
* Laboratory results: The patient's hemoglobin level is 10.2 g/dL, and his platelet count is 46 K/uL. His white blood cell count is 3.8 K/uL, and his creatinine level is 1.5 mg/dL.
* Assessment and plan: The patient is at risk for further bleeding and requires close monitoring. He is on anticoagulation therapy with warfarin, and his international normalized ratio (INR) is 1.5. He is also on aspirin and clopidogrel, which are contraindicated due to his bleeding risk. The patient is at risk for pneumonia and will require antibiotics and antifungal therapy if symptoms develop.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further bleeding: The patient is at risk for further bleeding due to his underlying condition and the presence of a large LLL mass.
* Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for pneumonia due to his underlying condition and the presence of a large LLL mass.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to his underlying condition and the presence of a large LLL mass.
* Cardiac complications: The patient is at risk for cardiac complications due to his underlying condition and the presence of a large LLL mass.
* Renal failure: The patient is at risk for renal failure due to his underlying condition and the presence of a large LLL mass.

Based on the patient's condition and the potential medical complications that can arise, it is recommended that the patient be closely monitored and receive aggressive treatment for any signs of bleeding, pneumonia, or respiratory failure."

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of hemoptysis. They have undergone arterial line insertion and removal without suturing. The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypertension and tachycardia, which have been managed with lopressor and ativan. They have also developed a fever, which has been treated with antibiotics and antifungals. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a stable heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. However, they have developed acute renal failure, which is being managed with gentle diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and they are at risk of developing respiratory failure due to atelectasis, LLL infarction, and possible pneumonia.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia may lead to cardiac complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's LE weakness, upgoing toes, and decreased tone may indicate neurological complications such as spinal cord compression or peripheral neuropathy.
4. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of infection, which may be caused by the LLL mass, pneumonia, or other underlying conditions.
5. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's hemoptysis and unstable blood pressure may increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications, such as bleeding from the LLL mass or other sites.
6. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
7. Sepsis: The patient's elevated temperature, white blood cell count, and decreased blood pressure may indicate the development of sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

 LE weakness: upgoing toes, 3/5 strength, will consult Neuro, too
   unstable for MRI now.
 Hypoxia/respiratory failure: probable d/t atelectasis + LLL
   infarction + ? pneumonia + residual hemorrhage + some volume overload.
   We will continue to gently diurese, chest PT, would not encourage cough
   given hemoptysis, would encourage deep breathing. Continue iv
   antibiotics, O2 supplementation. Send BNP
 Fever: spiked in the PACU ? related to developing LLL infarction, on
   vanco, levo, cefepime, and voriconzole. Will discuss with oncology re-
   stopping  voriconazole as he will need IV as he is not able to take po.
Acute Renal failure: send urine lytes, trend cr, will diurese gently
   given pulmonary status. Baseline ~1.3

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with hemoptysis, likely secondary to a left lower lobe (LLL) mass. The patient underwent embolization, which has stabilized their hemoglobin levels and stopped further bleeding. They are currently experiencing hypoxia, respiratory failure, and fever, which may be related to atelectasis, LLL infarction, and possible pneumonia. The patient has acute renal failure, and their laboratory results show elevated creatinine and potassium levels. They are also experiencing left lower extremity weakness, which is being managed with physical therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's hypoxia and respiratory failure may be exacerbated by pneumonia, which could lead to further respiratory compromise and potential sepsis.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxia and respiratory failure could progress to ARDS, which would require mechanical ventilation and potentially lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count could indicate sepsis, which would require prompt recognition and treatment to prevent multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure could worsen, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and potential need for dialysis.
5. Left Lower Lobe Infarction: The patient's LLL infarction could progress, leading to further respiratory compromise and potential pulmonary embolism.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's left lower extremity weakness could worsen, leading to potential neurological deficits and decreased mobility.
7. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of a LLL mass could increase their risk of infection, particularly pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and skin infections."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with known chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who presented with hemoptysis and was found to have a left lower lobe (LLL) mass. He underwent bronchoscopy, which was complicated by massive bleeding, and was subsequently treated with bronchial artery embolization. He is currently being treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory distress, anemia, and possible cardiac issues.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with persistent right upper lobe (RUL) collapse and pneumonia. He is at risk for further respiratory decline and potential need for reintubation.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia is worsening, with a current hematocrit (Hct) of 25%. He is at risk for further bleeding and may require transfusions.
3. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and is currently experiencing anteroseptal T wave inversions and ST depression on his electrocardiogram (ECG). He is at risk for further cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction and cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Renal Complications: The patient's creatinine (Cr) levels are elevated, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels are also elevated. He is at risk for further renal decline and potential need for dialysis.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is at risk for further infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Bleeding Complications: The patient has a history of bleeding complications, including massive bleeding during bronchoscopy. He is at risk for further bleeding, particularly in the setting of thrombocytopenia and anemia.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient has a history of lower extremity weakness, which may be related to spinal artery emboli or other neurological issues. He is at risk for further neurological decline and potential need for neurosurgical intervention.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is unstable, and he requires close monitoring and management in the ICU. He will continue to receive treatment for his respiratory distress, anemia, and cardiac issues. He will also require ongoing management of his bleeding complications, infection risk, and potential neurological issues."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with known Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), who presented with hemoptysis and was treated with embolization of the bronchial artery. The patient has several underlying medical conditions, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia, chronic kidney disease, and type II diabetes mellitus.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring shows a stable heart rate of 89 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 118/52 mmHg.
* The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula, with a SpO2 of 95%.
* The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute.
* The patient's neurological status is not fully assessed, but he is able to respond to stimuli.
* The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (1.5 mg/dL), urea nitrogen (158 mg/dL), and potassium (4.9 mEq/L).
* The patient's blood cultures have been negative to date.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's recent embolization of the bronchial artery and history of massive bleeding may increase the risk of further bleeding.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's persistant right upper lobe collapse and pneumonia may lead to respiratory distress and failure.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's coronary artery disease and recent episode of ischemia may increase the risk of further cardiac events.
4. Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of chronic kidney disease may worsen his renal function.
5. Anemia: The patient's autoimmune hemolytic anemia and recent blood loss may lead to further anemia and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and recent antibiotic treatment may increase the risk of infection.
7. Thrombotic complications: The patient's history of thrombocytopenia and recent blood loss may increase the risk of thrombotic complications.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan should be considered:

1. Monitor the patient's bleeding status closely and be prepared to intervene if bleeding occurs.
2. Continue respiratory support with oxygen therapy and consider non-invasive ventilation if necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and consider invasive cardiac monitoring if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider dialysis if necessary.
5. Continue transfusions to maintain a hemoglobin level of 25%.
6. Consider further treatment for pneumonia if the patient's respiratory status worsens.
7. Monitor the patient's infection status closely and consider further antibiotic treatment if necessary.
8. Consider thromboprophylaxis with heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin to reduce the risk of thrombotic complications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan as necessary to prevent complications and improve outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   70 year old male with known CLL presents with hemoptysis in setting of
   known LLL mass; now s/p embolization of bronchial artery.
   # Hemoptysis: patient underwent bronchoscopy complicated by massive
   bleeding from thrombus / mass lesion in LLL lobe; now s/p IR
   embolization of bronchial artery with injection of alcohol into the
   tumor. Currently Hct has been stable
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - Transfuse Hct< 25
   - If patient begins to have active bleeding, will need to intubate R.
   mainstem given site of bleed is left side; given high suspicion for
   metastatic renal cell cancer however options are limited if further
   bleeding develops, however will likely require thoracic surgery and IR
   #LUL Mass- Differential includes CLL vs Renal cell carcinoma in order
   to determine treatment options; currently need a tissue diagnosis.  IP
   not comfortable repeating bronch in light of bleeding that occurred on
   previous bronch.  Options include VATS vs mediastinoscopy
   -Will need to discuss with thoracic surgery
   .
   # Respiratory Distress- Patient successfully extubated, now stable on
   high flow oxygen however with embolized LLL and with persistant RUL
   collapse. Other components contributing to respiratory distress include
   pneumonia. Currently weaned down to 4L
   -Aggressive Chest PT
   -Continue nebs for bronchospasm
   -Treat anxiety prn
   -Will continue treatment for pneumonia with
   Vanc/Levo/Cefepime/Voriconazole-plan for 8 day course
   #Lower extremity weakness- Initial concern for possible spinal artery
   emboli post procedure; consulted neuro who felt less likely and didn
   want to get MRI given pt would not tolerate it (cannot lie flat);
   however pts ability to move lower extremities has improved; may be due
   to sedation/meds that are now wearing off
   -Continue to monitor exam closely
   -Neuro following, appreciate recs
   .
   #CAD: Patient with profound anemia in setting of CLL, autoimmune
   hemolitic anemia and recent large volume bleed. ECG now with
   anteroseptal T wave inversions and ~1mm ST depression along inferior
   leads. Given thrombocytopenia, recent bleeding and active CLL, patient
   is not a candidate for antiplatelet therapy (aspirin / clopidogrel) and
   this likely represents a demand related event and not platelet related
   coronary thrombosis. Troponin already on way down inspite of worsening
   renal function suggesting minimal myocardial involvement.. Enzymes have
   remained flat
   - Continue metoprolol as tolerated
   - Avoid aspirin / clopidogrel / heparin
   - Transfuse to goal Hct ~25, nitrates / morphine PRN
   ..
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr continues to be elevated 1.6 from 1.7 yesterday (baseline
   1.0-1.2); unclear etiology at this point but may be due to hypovolemia
   in setting of massive blood loss, however this is most likely cause.
   Given history of RCC however, this may also be contributing. FENA 2.7
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Anemia: Patient has known AIHA related to CLL and HCT 25 from
   baseline 28-30 with increased hyperbilirubinemia possibly related to
   hemolysis with elevated TB, low haptoglobin. Transfused 1 unit PRBCs in
   ED. Had responsded appropriate to transfusion, and hct stable
   - serial HCTs q8
   - Iron studies c/w ACD
   - GAS
   - resume Prednisone 5mg daily today now that tolerating PO
   .
   # CLL: Per oncology plan is to defer further treatment; oncologist Dr

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with known chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who presented with hemoptysis and a lung mass. The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which was complicated by massive bleeding from a thrombus/mass lesion in the left lower lobe (LLL) lung. The bleeding was stopped with embolization of the bronchial artery.

The patient is currently being treated in the ICU for respiratory distress, anemia, and hemoptysis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, and blood pressure of 118/52 mmHg.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress can worsen, leading to respiratory failure. This can be exacerbated by the patient's underlying chronic lung disease and the embolization of the bronchial artery.
2. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for further bleeding, particularly from the LLL lung. This can be life-threatening and may require emergency surgery.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to the tissues. This can exacerbate the patient's respiratory distress and increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly pneumonia, given his underlying lung disease and the embolization of the bronchial artery.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status can worsen, particularly given his underlying coronary artery disease and the potential for further bleeding.
6. Neurological complications: The patient is at risk for neurological complications, particularly spinal artery embolization, given his underlying CLL and the embolization of the bronchial artery.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal complications, particularly bleeding, given his underlying CLL and the potential for further bleeding.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Respiratory support: The patient is being treated with high-flow oxygen and will continue to receive aggressive chest physiotherapy to improve lung function.
2. Blood transfusions: The patient will continue to receive blood transfusions to correct his anemia.
3. Antibiotics: The patient will continue to receive antibiotics to treat pneumonia and other potential infections.
4. Cardiovascular support: The patient will continue to receive metoprolol to support his cardiac status.
5. Neurological monitoring: The patient will continue to be monitored for neurological complications, particularly spinal artery embolization.
6. Gastrointestinal monitoring: The patient will continue to be monitored for gastrointestinal complications, particularly bleeding.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for a number of potential medical complications, including respiratory failure, bleeding, anemia, infection, cardiac complications, neurological complications, and gastrointestinal complications. The patient's treatment plan is focused on supporting his respiratory status, correcting his anemia, treating potential infections, and monitoring for potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   70 year old male with known CLL presents with hemoptysis in setting of
   known LLL mass; now s/p embolization of bronchial artery.
   # Hemoptysis: patient underwent bronchoscopy complicated by massive
   bleeding from thrombus / mass lesion in LLL lobe; now s/p IR
   embolization of bronchial artery with injection of alcohol into the
   tumor. Currently Hct has been stable
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - Transfuse Hct< 25
   - If patient begins to have active bleeding, will need to intubate R.
   mainstem given site of bleed is left side; given high suspicion for
   metastatic renal cell cancer however options are limited if further
   bleeding develops, however will likely require thoracic surgery and IR
   #LUL Mass- Differential includes CLL vs Renal cell carcinoma in order
   to determine treatment options; currently need a tissue diagnosis.  IP
   not comfortable repeating bronch in light of bleeding that occurred on
   previous bronch.  Options include VATS vs mediastinoscopy
   -Will need to discuss with thoracic surgery
   .
   # Respiratory Distress- Patient successfully extubated, now stable on
   high flow oxygen however with embolized LLL and with persistant RUL
   collapse. Other components contributing to respiratory distress include
   pneumonia. Currently weaned down to 4L
   -Aggressive Chest PT
   -Continue nebs for bronchospasm
   -Treat anxiety prn
   -Will continue treatment for pneumonia with
   Vanc/Levo/Cefepime/Voriconazole-plan for 8 day course
   .# s/p fall: Pt fell from bed last night. Head CT negative.  Pt with
   some bleeding from lip.  Neuro exam stable
   -- cont neuro checks
   -- repeat CT-head if neuro exam changes
   -- neurology following
   .
   #Lower extremity weakness- Initial concern for possible spinal artery
   emboli post procedure; consulted neuro who felt less likely and didn
   want to get MRI given pt would not tolerate it (cannot lie flat);
   however pts ability to move lower extremities has improved; may be due
   to sedation/meds that are now wearing off
   -Continue to monitor exam closely
   -Neuro following, appreciate recs
   .
   #CAD: Patient with profound anemia in setting of CLL, autoimmune
   hemolitic anemia and recent large volume bleed. ECG now with
   anteroseptal T wave inversions and ~1mm ST depression along inferior
   leads. Given thrombocytopenia, recent bleeding and active CLL, patient
   is not a candidate for antiplatelet therapy (aspirin / clopidogrel) and
   this likely represents a demand related event and not platelet related
   coronary thrombosis. Troponin already on way down inspite of worsening
   renal function suggesting minimal myocardial involvement.. Enzymes have
   remained flat
   - Continue metoprolol as tolerated
   - Avoid aspirin / clopidogrel / heparin
   - Transfuse to goal Hct ~25, nitrates / morphine PRN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with known Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) who presented with hemoptysis in the setting of a known left lower lobe (LLL) mass. He underwent bronchoscopy complicated by massive bleeding from a thrombus/mass lesion in the LLL lobe, followed by interventional radiology (IR) embolization of the bronchial artery with injection of alcohol into the tumor. The patient is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with ongoing respiratory distress, anemia, and renal insufficiency.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 91 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 128/62 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 96%. His respiratory support includes a nasal cannula, and his lung examination reveals rhonchi on the right side.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 57 g/dL, elevated creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 42 x 10^9/L. His electrolyte levels are normal, and his liver function tests are slightly elevated.

The patient's medical history includes CLL, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and recent large-volume bleeding. He has a known left lower lobe mass, which is suspected to be metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The patient is not a candidate for antiplatelet therapy due to thrombocytopenia and recent bleeding.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory distress and pneumonia increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Bleeding: The patient's recent massive bleeding from the bronchial artery and thrombus/mass lesion in the LLL lobe may recur, potentially leading to further bleeding complications.
3. Anemia: The patient's ongoing anemia and recent large-volume bleeding may lead to further complications, such as heart failure or cardiogenic shock.
4. Renal insufficiency: The patient's elevated creatinine level and ongoing anemia may worsen his renal function, potentially leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and recent large-volume bleeding increase the risk of infection, particularly sepsis or septic shock.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's recent large-volume bleeding and anemia may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or cardiogenic shock.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's recent fall and ongoing anemia may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's current condition is stable, with ongoing respiratory distress, anemia, and renal insufficiency. The patient's bleeding has been stabilized, and his respiratory support has been adjusted. Further treatment is planned to address the patient's pneumonia, anemia, and renal insufficiency. The patient's oncologist has deferred further treatment for his CLL, and the patient is being closely monitored for any signs of complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   70 year old male with known CLL presents with hemoptysis in setting of
   known LLL mass; now s/p embolization of bronchial artery.
   # Hemoptysis: patient underwent bronchoscopy complicated by massive
   bleeding from thrombus / mass lesion in LLL lobe; now s/p IR
   embolization of bronchial artery with injection of alcohol into the
   tumor. Currently Hct has been stable
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - Transfuse Hct< 25
   - If patient begins to have active bleeding, will need to intubate R.
   mainstem given site of bleed is left side; given high suspicion for
   metastatic renal cell cancer however options are limited if further
   bleeding develops, however will likely require thoracic surgery and IR
   #LUL Mass- Differential includes CLL vs Renal cell carcinoma in order
   to determine treatment options; currently need a tissue diagnosis.  IP
   not comfortable repeating bronch in light of bleeding that occurred on
   previous bronch.  Options include VATS vs mediastinoscopy
   -Will need to discuss with thoracic surgery
   .
   # Respiratory Distress- Patient successfully extubated, now stable on
   high flow oxygen however with embolized LLL and with persistant RUL
   collapse. Other components contributing to respiratory distress include
   pneumonia. Currently weaned down to 4L
   -Aggressive Chest PT
   -Continue nebs for bronchospasm
   -Treat anxiety prn
   -Will continue treatment for pneumonia with
   Vanc/Levo/Cefepime/Voriconazole-plan for 8 day course
   .# s/p fall: Pt fell from bed last night. Head CT negative.  Pt with
   some bleeding from lip.  Neuro exam stable
   -- cont neuro checks
   -- repeat CT-head if neuro exam changes
   -- neurology following
   .
   #Lower extremity weakness- Initial concern for possible spinal artery
   emboli post procedure; consulted neuro who felt less likely and didn
   want to get MRI given pt would not tolerate it (cannot lie flat);
   however pts ability to move lower extremities has improved; may be due
   to sedation/meds that are now wearing off
   -Continue to monitor exam closely
   -Neuro following, appreciate recs
   .
   #CAD: Patient with profound anemia in setting of CLL, autoimmune
   hemolitic anemia and recent large volume bleed. ECG now with
   anteroseptal T wave inversions and ~1mm ST depression along inferior
   leads. Given thrombocytopenia, recent bleeding and active CLL, patient
   is not a candidate for antiplatelet therapy (aspirin / clopidogrel) and
   this likely represents a demand related event and not platelet related
   coronary thrombosis. Troponin already on way down inspite of worsening
   renal function suggesting minimal myocardial involvement.. Enzymes have
   remained flat
   - Continue metoprolol as tolerated
   - Avoid aspirin / clopidogrel / heparin
   - Transfuse to goal Hct ~25, nitrates / morphine PRN
   ..
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr continues to be elevated 1.6 from 1.7 yesterday (baseline
   1.0-1.2); unclear etiology at this point but may be due to hypovolemia
   in setting of massive blood loss, however this is most likely cause.
   Given history of RCC however, this may also be contributing. FENA 2.7
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Anemia: Patient has known AIHA related to CLL and HCT 25 from
   baseline 28-30 with increased hyperbilirubinemia possibly related to
   hemolysis with elevated TB, low haptoglobin. Transfused 1 unit PRBCs in
   ED. Had responsded appropriate to transfusion, and hct stable
   - serial HCTs q8
   - Iron studies c/w ACD
   - GAS
   - resume Prednisone 5mg daily today now that tolerating PO

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), who was admitted to the ICU for hemoptysis and underwent bronchoscopy complicated by massive bleeding from a thrombus/mass lesion in the left lower lobe (LLL) lobe. He was subsequently embolized with alcohol injection into the tumor. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) has been stable, but he has experienced some bleeding from his lip and has a history of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) related to his CLL.

The patient's current condition is stable, but he has several potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has persistent right upper lobe (RUL) collapse and pneumonia, which may require further treatment.
2. Lower Extremity Weakness: The patient's initial concern for possible spinal artery emboli has been ruled out, but he may still have some weakness in his lower extremities due to sedation/medications.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has profound anemia, thrombocytopenia, and recent large-volume bleeding, which may increase his risk of CAD. He is not a candidate for antiplatelet therapy (aspirin/clopidogrel) due to his thrombocytopenia.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine (Cr) level has increased to 1.6, which may be due to hypovolemia or underlying kidney disease.
5. Anemia: The patient's Hct has decreased to 25 from a baseline of 28-30, and he has received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in the emergency department.
6. CLL: The patient's oncologist has deferred further treatment for his CLL, and the patient is currently being monitored for any signs of progression.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may require further treatment, including antibiotics and respiratory support.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's RUL collapse and pneumonia may lead to respiratory failure, which may require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's CAD and anemia may increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, including myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and arrhythmias.
4. Kidney Injury: The patient's AKI may worsen if he does not receive adequate fluid resuscitation and treatment.
5. Bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding from his lip and recent large-volume bleeding may increase his risk of further bleeding complications.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to his CLL and recent blood transfusions may increase his risk of infection.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's pneumonia with antibiotics and respiratory support.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and provide treatment for any signs of cardiovascular complications.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and provide treatment for any signs of kidney injury.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding status and provide treatment for any signs of further bleeding complications.
6. Consider further treatment for the patient's CLL, including chemotherapy or radiation therapy, if his disease progresses."

   Assessment and Plan
   70 year old male with known CLL presents with hemoptysis in setting of
   known LLL mass; now s/p embolization of bronchial artery.
   # Hemoptysis: patient underwent bronchoscopy complicated by massive
   bleeding from thrombus / mass lesion in LLL lobe; now s/p IR
   embolization of bronchial artery with injection of alcohol into the
   tumor. Currently Hct has been stable
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - Transfuse Hct< 25
   - If patient begins to have active bleeding, will need to intubate R.
   mainstem given site of bleed is left side; given high suspicion for
   metastatic renal cell cancer however options are limited if further
   bleeding develops, however will likely require thoracic surgery and IR
   #LUL Mass- Differential includes CLL vs Renal cell carcinoma in order
   to determine treatment options; currently need a tissue diagnosis.  IP
   not comfortable repeating bronch in light of bleeding that occurred on
   previous bronch.  Options include VATS vs mediastinoscopy
   -Will need to discuss with thoracic surgery
   .
   # Respiratory Distress- Patient successfully extubated, now stable on
   high flow oxygen however with embolized LLL and with persistant RUL
   collapse. Other components contributing to respiratory distress include
   pneumonia. Currently weaned down to 4L
   -Aggressive Chest PT
   -Continue nebs for bronchospasm
   -Treat anxiety prn
   -Will continue treatment for pneumonia with
   Vanc/Levo/Cefepime/Voriconazole-plan for 8 day course
   #Lower extremity weakness- Initial concern for possible spinal artery
   emboli post procedure; consulted neuro who felt less likely and didn
   want to get MRI given pt would not tolerate it (cannot lie flat);
   however pts ability to move lower extremities has improved; may be due
   to sedation/meds that are now wearing off
   -Continue to monitor exam closely
   -Neuro following, appreciate recs

   #CAD: Patient with profound anemia in setting of CLL, autoimmune
   hemolitic anemia and recent large volume bleed. ECG now with
   anteroseptal T wave inversions and ~1mm ST depression along inferior
   leads. Given thrombocytopenia, recent bleeding and active CLL, patient
   is not a candidate for antiplatelet therapy (aspirin / clopidogrel) and
   this likely represents a demand related event and not platelet related
   coronary thrombosis. Troponin already on way down inspite of worsening
   renal function suggesting minimal myocardial involvement.. Enzymes have
   remained flat
   - Continue metoprolol as tolerated
   - Avoid aspirin / clopidogrel / heparin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who was admitted to the ICU for hemoptysis. He underwent bronchoscopy complicated by massive bleeding from a thrombus/mass lesion in the left lower lobe (LLL) and was subsequently treated with embolization of the bronchial artery. The patient is currently receiving treatment for pneumonia with vancomycin, cefepime, and voriconazole.

The patient has experienced several medical complications, including:

1. Fall: The patient fell out of bed at midnight, which resulted in a head computed tomography (CT) scan that was preliminarily negative.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient has persistent respiratory distress due to embolization of the LLL and pneumonia, which has required high-flow oxygen and nebulizers.
3. Lower extremity weakness: The patient initially had concern for possible spinal artery emboli post-procedure, but his ability to move his lower extremities has improved, which may be due to sedation/medications wearing off.
4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has profound anemia in the setting of CLL, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and recent large-volume bleeding, which has resulted in anteroseptal T-wave inversions and ST depression on his electrocardiogram (ECG).
5. Elevated creatinine: The patient's creatinine level has continued to be elevated, with a value of 1.6 mg/dL, which may be due to hypovolemia in the setting of massive blood loss or possibly related to his history of renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

Potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to his underlying respiratory disease and treatment with immunosuppressive agents.
2. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding complications, including the massive bleeding episode during bronchoscopy, and is at risk for further bleeding complications.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's CAD and anemia may increase his risk for cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
4. Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine level may indicate renal damage or dysfunction, which could worsen if left untreated.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not treated, which could further compromise his respiratory and cardiac function.

Plan:

1. Continue treatment for pneumonia with vancomycin, cefepime, and voriconazole.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust oxygen therapy as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment accordingly.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust treatment accordingly.
7. Consider discussing the patient's treatment options with the oncologist to determine the best course of action for his CLL.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust treatment accordingly.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust treatment accordingly.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's lines and adjust treatment accordingly."
