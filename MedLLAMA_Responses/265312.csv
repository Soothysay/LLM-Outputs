   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male with recent pneumonectomy for SCCA in the setting of a
   history of COPD and now admitted with progressive respiratory distress
   in the setting of cough and worsening dyspnea.  CXR at rehab concerning
   for PNA and ABX started 2 days ago following Rx of Vanco/Zosyn.  He had
   significant and persistent respiratory distress in the setting of A-fib
   and has maintained tachycardia despite continued ABX, nebs and
   supplemental O2 support.  He required BIPAP support for persistent and
   worsening hypoxemia this morning.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with COPD, pneumonectomy and reasonable
   clinical history and CXR findings to suggest PNA.  Certainly metastatic
   involvement and lymphagiocarcinomatosis is possible but given acute
   changes will likely be rapid onset of changes consistent with acute
   infectious process.
   -Will continue with non-invasive ventilatory support
   -Vanco/Zosyn
   -Follow up sputum cultures
   -Will continue with Solumedrol but COPD flare does not appear to be
   dominant pathology here and will have to evaluate change and tolerance
   on ventilator given nl PCO2 and exam
   2)Atrial Fibrillation-
   -Continue Amiodarone
   -Continue with B-blocker
   -F/U ECG post intubation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of COPD, who underwent pneumonectomy for SCCA and is currently admitted with progressive respiratory distress, cough, and worsening dyspnea. The patient's vital signs are:

* T-max: 36.7°C (98°F)
* T-current: 36.7°C (98°F)
* HR: 72 bpm (71-126 bpm)
* BP: 113/55 mmHg (69-126/89 mmHg)
* RR: 22 inspirations per minute (22-31 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 95%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat
* Tachycardia with a regular rhythm
* Distant S2 heart sound
* No peripheral vascular pulses assessed
* Respiratory/chest examination shows symmetric expansion, dull percussion, and crackles and wheezes in both lungs
* Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present
* Extremities show trace edema in both legs
* Skin is not assessed
* Neurologic examination shows the patient follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has no movement or tone assessment

Laboratory results include:

* WBC: 10.5 K/uL
* Hct: 35.9%
* Plt: 556 K/uL
* Cr: 0.7 mg/dL
* TCO2: 29 mmHg
* Glucose: 196 mg/dL
* Other labs show Lactic Acid: 1.9 mmol/L, Ca++: 9.0 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.5 mg/dL, PO4: 3.7 mg/dL

Imaging studies include a CXR showing LLL infiltrate with consolidation, concerning for pneumonia.

The patient's conditions and potential medical complications are:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has COPD, pneumonectomy, and a CXR showing LLL infiltrate with consolidation, suggesting pneumonia. He requires non-invasive ventilatory support, antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn), and follow-up sputum cultures.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of A-fib and requires continuation of Amiodarone and B-blocker therapy.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient has persistent and worsening hypoxemia, which requires BIPAP support.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has a CXR showing LLL infiltrate with consolidation, concerning for pneumonia.
5. COPD flare: The patient has a history of COPD, which may be contributing to his respiratory distress.
6. Metastatic involvement and lymphangio-carcinomatosis: Although less likely, these conditions should be considered in the patient's differential diagnosis.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has tachycardia and may be at risk for cardiovascular instability due to his underlying conditions and medication regimen.
8. Sepsis: The patient has a history of pneumonia and sepsis should be considered in his differential diagnosis.
9. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate further, requiring closer monitoring and potential intubation.
10. ICU-acquired complications: The patient is at risk for ICU-acquired complications such as VAP, DVT, and stress ulceration."

   74 yo M with COPD, s/p right pneumonectomy with increasing dyspnea and
   worsening O2 requirement who was found to have a LLL consolidation at
   rehab and was admited to ICU for hypoxemia requiring NRB.
   Hypoxemia/respiratory distress: patient with poor reserve given recent
   right pneumonectomy and underlying mild COPD.  Given clinical picture
   and images, likely pneumonia.  With recent hospitalizations and rehab
   stay will need to treat emperically for HAP.  Also on differential is
   COPD flair, PE, cong heart failure and mucous plugging/atelectasis. CTA
   negative for PE.  However with consolidation on CXR and PE exam

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of COPD, who underwent right pneumonectomy and was admitted to the ICU for hypoxemia requiring NRB. He was intubated on assist control ventilation overnight and a CTA showed no evidence of PE, but did reveal left lower lobe pneumonia vs aspiration pneumonitis and emphysematous changes. The patient's blood and sputum cultures are pending. He has a PICC line in place and is receiving vancomycin and Zosyn for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, and blood pressure of 86/44 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and has a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. His ABG results show a pH of 7.44, pCO2 of 48 mmHg, and pO2 of 77 mmHg.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is receiving amiodarone and metoprolol. He is also receiving anticoagulation therapy with aspirin and lovenox.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 10.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 556 K/uL. His creatinine level is 0.7 mg/dL, and his lactate level is 1.9 mmol/L.

The patient's plan includes continuing vancomycin and Zosyn for HAP, frequent nebs, and a pressure support trial today. He will also continue to receive lasix 20 mg daily and will have arterial access established.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or COPD exacerbation
* Sepsis or septic shock due to HAP
* Hypotension or hypovolemic shock due to fluid loss or cardiac dysfunction
* Atrial fibrillation or other cardiac arrhythmias
* Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism
* Mucous plugging or atelectasis
* COPD exacerbation or respiratory failure
* Infection or sepsis from indwelling lines or devices
* Metastatic spread of lung cancer"

* Heart rate: 69 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 86/44 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a heart rhythm of atrial fibrillation, with a mean arterial pressure of 54 mmHg. The patient's fluid balance is as follows:

* Total in: 4,289 mL
* Total out: 1,030 mL
* Balance: 3,259 mL

The patient is receiving various medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, and antibiotics. The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.5 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 35.9%
* Platelet count: 556 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Total CO2: 29 mmHg
* Glucose: 196 mg/dL
* Other labs: Lactic acid: 1.9 mmol/L, calcium: 9.0 mg/dL, magnesium: 2.5 mg/dL, phosphate: 3.7 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their critical condition, but it is noted that their peripheral vascular examination, skin examination, and neurologic examination are not assessable.

Based on this information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo M with COPD, s/p right pneumonectomy with increasing dyspnea and
   worsening O2 requirement who was found to have a LLL consolidation at
   rehab and was admitted to ICU for hypoxemia requiring NRB, now with
   findings on CTA concerning for air leak into the right chest.
   Hypoxemia/respiratory distress: patient with poor reserve given recent
   right pneumonectomy and underlying mild COPD.  Given clinical picture
   and images, likely pneumonia with evolving sepsis.  With recent
   hospitalizations and rehab stay will need to treat empirically for
   HAP.  Also on differential is COPD flair, PE, cong heart failure and
   mucous plugging/atelectasis. CTA negative for PE but concerning for
   leak into right chest (post-operative dehiscence of right mainstem
   closure?).
   -continue Vanc/Zosyn for HAP, broaden for atypicals with azithromycin
   -standing nebs
   -stop steroids
   -infectious work-up with sputum bacterial and viral cultures, urine
   legionella
   -establish arterial access
   -thoracics consult to evaluate right chest air leak, consider
   bronchoscopy
   -decrease PEEP as tolerated, may increase tidal volume to allow for
   better ventilation
   -repeat ABG later this morning
   # Hypotension: received 4L overnight, still hypotensive. Concern of
   evolving sepsis versus impaired cardiac output due to elevated
   intrathoracic pressure from possible bronchial leak
   -thoracics consult as above
   -establish central venous access and start Levophed
   -continue to bolus with IVF for goal MAP >60
   # Acute renal failure: likely prerenal in setting of sepsis, decreased
   renal perfusion
   -check urine electrolytes
   -renal consult
   -IVF as above
   -treat hyperkalemia with insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate
   # Elevated INR:
   -will send for DIC panel, also check liver enzymes
   # COPD: possible flair but unlikely (see above).  No known PFTs.
   Patient recieved solu-medrol in ED.  On solmederol at home.
   -stop steroids today
   -nebs standing and PRN
   # A-Fib: recent dx per patient.  Possibly occurring in peri-op time.
   Patient on amiodarone 200mg until [**5-2**].  Also on metoprolol 37.5.
   -holding metoprolol due to hypotension
   -hold anticoagulation for now
   # Lung Ca: Recent Dx of squameous cell lung cancer.  Unclear if disease
   metastatic.  Patient coping well with Dx.  Nothing to do for now.
   Continue outpatient work up.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo M with COPD, s/p right pneumonectomy with increasing dyspnea and
   worsening O2 requirement who was found to have a LLL consolidation at
   rehab and was admitted to ICU for hypoxemia requiring NRB, now with
   findings on CTA concerning for air leak into the right chest.
   Hypoxemia/respiratory distress: patient with poor reserve given recent
   right pneumonectomy and underlying mild COPD.  Given clinical picture
   and images, likely pneumonia with evolving sepsis.  With recent
   hospitalizations and rehab stay will need to treat empirically for
   HAP.  Also on differential is COPD flair, PE, cong heart failure and
   mucous plugging/atelectasis. CTA negative for PE but concerning for
   leak into right chest (post-operative dehiscence of right mainstem
   closure?).
   -continue Vanc/Zosyn for HAP, broaden for atypicals with azithromycin
   -standing nebs
   -stop steroids
   -infectious work-up with sputum bacterial and viral cultures, urine
   legionella
   -establish arterial access
   -thoracics consult to evaluate right chest air leak, consider
   bronchoscopy
   -decrease PEEP as tolerated, may increase tidal volume to allow for
   better ventilation
   -repeat ABG later this morning
   # Hypotension: received 4L overnight, still hypotensive. Concern of
   evolving sepsis versus impaired cardiac output due to elevated
   intrathoracic pressure from possible bronchial leak
   -thoracics consult as above
   -establish central venous access and start Levophed
   -continue to bolus with IVF for goal MAP >60
   # Acute renal failure: likely prerenal in setting of sepsis, decreased
   renal perfusion
   -check urine electrolytes
   -renal consult
   -IVF as above
   -treat hyperkalemia with insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate
   # Elevated INR:
   -will send for DIC panel, also check liver enzymes
   # COPD: possible flair but unlikely (see above).  No known PFTs.
   Patient recieved solu-medrol in ED.  On solmederol at home.
   -stop steroids today
   -nebs standing and PRN
   # A-Fib: recent dx per patient.  Possibly occurring in peri-op time.
   Patient on amiodarone 200mg until [**5-2**].  Also on metoprolol 37.5.
   -holding metoprolol due to hypotension
   -hold anticoagulation for now

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who underwent a right pneumonectomy and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypoxemia requiring non-rebreather mask (NRB). The patient's condition has deteriorated, with worsening oxygen requirements and findings on computed tomography angiogram (CTA) concerning for air leak into the right chest.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98°F)
* Heart rate: 69 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 86/44 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Intubated and sedated
* Absent breath sounds on the right side, with coarse breath sounds throughout the left lung field
* Distant S1 and S2 heart sounds, with a regular rhythm
* Soft and non-tender abdomen

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.5 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 35.9%
* Platelet count: 556 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 27 mg/dL
* Glucose: 196 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.9 mmol/L
* Calcium: 9.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.5 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.7 mg/dL

The patient's condition is complicated by:

* Hypoxemia and respiratory distress
* Air leak into the right chest, potentially related to post-operative dehiscence of the right mainstem closure
* Sepsis, likely related to pneumonia
* Acute renal failure, likely prerenal in origin
* Elevated INR, potentially related to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
* Atrial fibrillation
* Hyperkalemia
* Possible flair of COPD

The plan is to:

* Continue vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)
* Broaden antibiotics to include atypical organisms with azithromycin
* Stop steroids
* Perform infectious work-up, including sputum bacterial and viral cultures, urine legionella
* Establish arterial access
* Consult thoracic surgery to evaluate the right chest air leak and consider bronchoscopy
* Decrease PEEP as tolerated and increase tidal volume to improve ventilation
* Repeat ABG later in the morning

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening respiratory failure
* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Acute kidney injury
* Bleeding complications due to coagulopathy
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Hyperkalemia
* Mucous plugging and atelectasis
* Pneumonia-related complications, such as pleural effusion or empyema."

   Fluid analysis / Other labs: 7.03/94/63
   Imaging: CXR--Patient with left sided lower lobe infiltrates noted on
   morning film.  In addition patient with suggestion of air in right
   chest which is new.  Minimal evidence for evolution of significant
   pulmonary edema.
   CTA-Confirming large cavity with air-fluid level in right chest.
   Extensive emphysema and GGO in left lung at base and with some areas of
   confluent opacity.
   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male with h/o COPD and also pneumonectomy now presenting with
   multfocal PNA in remaining lung.  His initial presentation was one of
   progressive respiratory distress and subsequent respiratory failure
   with both COPD, impaired baseline function and multifocal PNA driving
   respiratory failure.  Of note he also has had signficiant hypotension
   which is secondary to significant impairment in right sided heart
   function as well as progression of pneumonia to septic shock despite 5
   liters IVF fluid resuscitation.  Patient has had substantial
   detrioration across the night
likely representing a worsening of
   ventilation in the setting of multifocal PNA and severe COPD and with
   severe respiratory acidosis.  In addition patient has had worsening
   hypotension which appears to be a manifestation of evolving sepsis
   1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])-
   -Pneumonia
will continue with Vanco/Zosyn, will send sputum culture and
   viral cultures
inculding influenze and given concern for possible
   atypical bacterial organisms including Mycoplasma and Chlamydia.  Will
   need to consider bronch to eval significant air leak into right chest
   and if performed or unable to get a sample
will need to stabilize
   ventilation as possible
   -COPD-Resistance and compliance to this point do appear to be
   reasonable, wheezing is minimal so will D/C systemic steroids at this
   point given minimal evidence of significant and persistent
   bronchospasm.
   -Hypercarbia
have moved to RR at 24-28 which appears maximum and based
   on ABG will need to consider further increase in Vt from 320
360 if
   needed
   -Hypoxemia
Will have to decrease PEEP as close to 0 as tolerated with
   evidence of significant air leak into right chest.  Will maintain FIO2
   at 1.0 to allow some adequate oxygenation
   -Needs A-line now and will work with anesthesia to maintain placement.
   2)Sepsis-Likely secondary to significant pulmonary infection with
   systemic insult now evolving across time despite ABX and Fluids given.
    Now with pressors started and will move to central pressors and CVP
   measurements.
   -CVP goal to be driven by findings and consistent with right heart
   failure
   -Pressors to change to Levophed
   -Will continue ABX
   -Will need to address all sources of infection including right chest
   and
   -Will check for DIC labs now
   2.5)Pleural Space Infection/Air fluid level-
   -Likely wound dehisence from right mainstem closure.  Will need to
   evaluate and treat ASAP with visualization.
   -Minimze PEEP
   -Thoracic Surgery Consultation for urgent evaluation
   3)Acute Renal Failure-This is likely related to significant ATN from
   sepsis and a significant component of pre-renal azotemia.
   -Will continue with volume and BP support
   -Will check FENa to confirm
   -Will need to check urine for muddy brown casts
   -Consider renal consult for CVVH if worsening volume
   status/hyperkalemia all seen
   4)A-Fib-

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Extensive emphysema and GGO in left lung at base and with some areas of
   confluent opacity.
   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male with h/o COPD and also pneumonectomy now presenting with
   multfocal PNA in remaining lung.  His initial presentation was one of
   progressive respiratory distress and subsequent respiratory failure
   with both COPD, impaired baseline function and multifocal PNA driving
   respiratory failure.  Of note he also has had signficiant hypotension
   which is secondary to significant impairment in right sided heart
   function as well as progression of pneumonia to septic shock despite 5
   liters IVF fluid resuscitation.  Patient has had substantial
   detrioration across the night
likely representing a worsening of
   ventilation in the setting of multifocal PNA and severe COPD and with
   severe respiratory acidosis.  In addition patient has had worsening
   hypotension which appears to be a manifestation of evolving sepsis
   1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])-
   -Pneumonia
will continue with Vanco/Zosyn, will send sputum culture and
   viral cultures
inculding influenze and given concern for possible
   atypical bacterial organisms including Mycoplasma and Chlamydia.  Will
   need to consider bronch to eval significant air leak into right chest
   and if performed or unable to get a sample
will need to stabilize
   ventilation as possible
   -COPD-Resistance and compliance to this point do appear to be
   reasonable, wheezing is minimal so will D/C systemic steroids at this
   point given minimal evidence of significant and persistent
   bronchospasm.
   -Hypercarbia
have moved to RR at 24-28 which appears maximum and based
   on ABG will need to consider further increase in Vt from 320
360 if
   needed
   -Hypoxemia
Will have to decrease PEEP as close to 0 as tolerated with
   evidence of significant air leak into right chest.  Will maintain FIO2
   at 1.0 to allow some adequate oxygenation
   -Needs A-line now and will work with anesthesia to maintain placement.
   2)Sepsis-Likely secondary to significant pulmonary infection with
   systemic insult now evolving across time despite ABX and Fluids given.
    Now with pressors started and will move to central pressors and CVP
   measurements.
   -CVP goal to be driven by findings and consistent with right heart
   failure
   -Pressors to change to Levophed
   -Will continue ABX
   -Will need to address all sources of infection including right chest
   and
   -Will check for DIC labs now
   2.5)Pleural Space Infection/Air fluid level-
   -Likely wound dehisence from right mainstem closure.  Will need to
   evaluate and treat ASAP with visualization.
   -Minimze PEEP
   -Thoracic Surgery Consultation for urgent evaluation
   3)Acute Renal Failure-This is likely related to significant ATN from
   sepsis and a significant component of pre-renal azotemia.
   -Will continue with volume and BP support
   -Will check FENa to confirm
   -Will need to check urine for muddy brown casts
   -Consider renal consult for CVVH if worsening volume
   status/hyperkalemia all seen
   4)A-Fib-
   Amiodarone
   -Will hold anticoagulation

   Total time spent: 90 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonectomy, who is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure, sepsis, acute renal failure, and pleural space infection.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with persistent hypoxemia and worsening hypercarbic failure. He requires invasive ventilation, and his oxygenation is being maintained with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%. The patient's respiratory acidosis is worsening, and his ventilation parameters need to be adjusted accordingly.

The patient's hemodynamic status is also critical, with significant impairment in right-sided heart function and hypotension. He has been receiving fluid resuscitation, and his central venous pressure (CVP) goal is being driven by findings consistent with right heart failure.

The patient has a high risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) due to sepsis and pre-renal azotemia. His creatinine level is 2.2 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 36 mg/dL. He is being managed with volume and blood pressure support, and his urine output is being monitored closely.

The patient has a pleural space infection with an air-fluid level in his right chest, which is likely due to a wound dehiscence from his right mainstem closure. He requires urgent evaluation and treatment, and a thoracic surgery consultation has been requested.

The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation, and he is being managed with amiodarone. He has a high risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and he is receiving prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH).

The patient's nutritional status is being managed with nothing by mouth (NPO), and his glycemic control is being monitored closely. He has a central venous catheter (CVC) and a peripheral intravenous catheter (PICC) in place, and he is receiving prophylactic antibiotics.

The patient's condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and management in the ICU. His family has been informed of his acute decline, and they have been advised to provide a full update. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: Pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, and pleural space infection can all contribute to respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely secondary to his pulmonary infection, and it can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury is likely related to sepsis and pre-renal azotemia, and it can lead to chronic kidney disease.
4. Pleural space infection: The patient's pleural space infection can lead to empyema, which can be life-threatening.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can increase his risk of stroke and cardiac arrest.
6. Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism: The patient's high risk of DVT and PE can lead to life-threatening complications.
7. Wound dehiscence: The patient's wound dehiscence can lead to infection and further complications.
8. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation: The patient's COPD exacerbation can lead to respiratory failure and death.
9. Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy: The patient's sepsis can lead to cardiomyopathy, which can be life-threatening.
10. Multi-organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis can lead to multi-organ dysfunction, which can be life-threatening."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo M with COPD, s/p right pneumonectomy with increasing dyspnea and
   worsening O2 requirement who was found to have a LLL consolidation at
   rehab and was admitted to ICU for hypoxemia requiring NRB, now with
   findings on CTA concerning for air leak into the right chest.
   Hypoxemia/respiratory distress: patient with poor reserve given recent
   right pneumonectomy and underlying mild COPD.  Given clinical picture
   and images, likely pneumonia with evolving sepsis.  With recent
   hospitalizations and rehab stay will need to treat empirically for
   HAP.  Also on differential is COPD flair, PE, cong heart failure and
   mucous plugging/atelectasis. CTA negative for PE but concerning for
   leak into right chest (post-operative dehiscence of right mainstem
   closure?).
   -continue Vanc/Zosyn for HAP, broaden for atypicals with azithromycin
   -standing nebs
   -stop steroids
   -infectious work-up with sputum bacterial and viral cultures, urine
   legionella
   -establish arterial access

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo M with COPD, s/p right pneumonectomy with increasing dyspnea and
   worsening O2 requirement who was found to have a LLL consolidation at
   rehab and was admitted to ICU for hypoxemia requiring NRB, now with
   findings on CTA concerning for air leak into the right chest.
   Hypoxemia/respiratory distress: patient with poor reserve given recent
   right pneumonectomy and underlying mild COPD.  Given clinical picture
   and images, likely pneumonia with evolving sepsis.  With recent
   hospitalizations and rehab stay will need to treat empirically for
   HAP.  Also on differential is COPD flair, PE, cong heart failure and
   mucous plugging/atelectasis. CTA negative for PE but concerning for
   leak into right chest (post-operative dehiscence of right mainstem
   closure?).
   -continue Vanc/Zosyn for HAP, broaden for atypicals with azithromycin
   -standing nebs
   -stop steroids
   -infectious work-up with sputum bacterial and viral cultures, urine
   legionella
   -establish arterial access
   -thoracics consult to evaluate right chest air leak, consider
   bronchoscopy
   -decrease PEEP as tolerated, may increase tidal volume to allow for
   better ventilation
   -repeat ABG later this morning
   # Hypotension: received 4L overnight, still hypotensive. Concern of
   evolving sepsis versus impaired cardiac output due to elevated
   intrathoracic pressure from possible bronchial leak
   -thoracics consult as above
   -establish central venous access and start Levophed
   -continue to bolus with IVF for goal MAP >60
   # Acute renal failure: likely prerenal in setting of sepsis, decreased
   renal perfusion
   -check urine electrolytes
   -renal consult
   -IVF as above
   -treat hyperkalemia with insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate
   # Elevated INR:
   -will send for DIC panel, also check liver enzymes
   # COPD: possible flair but unlikely (see above).  No known PFTs.
   Patient recieved solu-medrol in ED.  On solmederol at home.
   -stop steroids today
   -nebs standing and PRN
   # A-Fib: recent dx per patient.  Possibly occurring in peri-op time.
   Patient on amiodarone 200mg until [**5-2**].  Also on metoprolol 37.5.
   -holding metoprolol due to hypotension
   -hold anticoagulation for now
   # Lung Ca: Recent Dx of squameous cell lung cancer.  Unclear if disease
   metastatic.  Patient coping well with Dx.  Nothing to do for now.
   Continue outpatient work up.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who underwent a right pneumonectomy and was admitted to the ICU for worsening hypoxemia and respiratory distress. The patient has developed several medical complications, including:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation has decreased to 89% despite being on 100% FiO2, and his ABG results show a PaO2 of 59 mmHg.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient has coarse breath sounds throughout his left lung field and absent breath sounds on the right side, suggesting a possible air leak into the right chest.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has a left lower lobe consolidation on CT scan, which is likely due to pneumonia.
4. Sepsis: The patient's clinical picture and laboratory results suggest evolving sepsis, with a white blood cell count of 17.5 x 10^9/L and a C-reactive protein level of 348 mg/dL.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 2.9 mg/dL, and his urine output has decreased to 355 mL over 24 hours.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 96/58 mmHg, and he has received 4L of fluid overnight. His heart rate is 94 beats per minute, and his central venous pressure is 16 mmHg.
7. Elevated INR: The patient's INR is 30.2, which may be due to sepsis or liver dysfunction.
8. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a recent diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and is receiving amiodarone 1 mg/min.
9. Lung cancer: The patient has a recent diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer, and it is unclear if the disease is metastatic.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia.
2. Mechanical ventilation: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.
3. Fluid management: The patient is receiving IV fluids to maintain a mean arterial pressure of greater than 60 mmHg.
4. Renal support: The patient is receiving IV fluids and may require dialysis if his renal function does not improve.
5. Anticoagulation: The patient is receiving low-molecular-weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.
6. Cardioversion: The patient's atrial fibrillation is being monitored, and cardioversion may be considered if his heart rate remains elevated.
7. Lung cancer treatment: The patient is receiving outpatient work-up for his lung cancer, and further treatment will depend on the results of his diagnostic tests.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Pneumonia progression: The patient's pneumonia may progress and require more aggressive treatment.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen and require more aggressive treatment, including vasopressors and corticosteroids.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may require dialysis and further management.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may require more aggressive treatment, including vasopressors and fluids.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may require cardioversion or anticoagulation therapy.
6. Lung cancer progression: The patient's lung cancer may progress and require more aggressive treatment, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo M with COPD, s/p right pneumonectomy with increasing dyspnea and
   worsening O2 requirement who was found to have a LLL consolidation at
   rehab and was admitted to ICU for hypoxemia, clinical status continuing
   to worsen.
   # Hypoxemia/respiratory distress: Patient with poor reserve given
   recent right pneumonectomy and underlying mild COPD.  Given clinical
   picture and images, likely pneumonia with evolving sepsis and
   complicated by pulmonary embolism and air-fluid level in R
   pneumonectomy cavity s/p chest tube placement.
   -Continue Vanc and azithromycin for PNA, change Zosyn to Meropenem for
   coverage of ESBL
   -F/u pending micro including from bronch
   -Continue heparin gtt for PE, f/u LENIs
   -Chest tube in place; f/u Thoracics recs
   -Steroids discontinued [**4-22**] as COPD likely major component; continue
   standing nebs
   -Increasing PEEP or trial of PS are remaining options in optimizing
   respiratory status
   # Hypotension: Likely with components from sepsis unresponsive to
   current abx, cardiogenic given arrythmia, anatomic given R pleural
   cavity process.
   -Broaden abx coverage as above
   -Continue amiodarone gtt for Afib (can d/c home po dose)
   -Continue chest tube and f/u Thoracics recs
   -Ability to fluid resuscitate limited by respiratory status; can try
   small boluses as tolerated
   -Continue pressors which are currently maxed out; dobutamine would be
   option but run risk of increasing susceptibility to arrhythmia
   # Acute renal failure: Rapid decline
   -Appreciate renal recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Family meeting: confirmed full code
   - Renal consulted for rapidly worsening renal function
   - CT chest with large R air-fluid cavity -> PEEP decreased to 4,
   Thoracics consulted. Chest tube placed with 1L drained of exudative
   fluid. Bronch'd with thick secretions from L side (?PNA), no evidence
   of large hole or chest tube leak with positive pressure. Lavage (sent
   for micro). Hypoxia after lavage to 88%, improved to 98% with left side
   down. Vent settings adjustments: Vt and FiO2 increased, PEEP decreased
   to 3. PEEP increased back to 5 for increasing hypoxia as FiO2 and Vt
   maxed.
   - Started on heparin gtt for revised CT-PE read of subsegmental PE in
   LUL
   - R Brachial A-line placed, started on norepinephrine. Increased to 0.4
   as hypotensive after bronch with stabililization of BP. Titrated back
   down to 0.3 overnight as MAPs in 70s. Became hypotensive this AM in
   setting of intermittent Afib with RVR converted back to sinus first to
   phenylephrine and then amiodarone bolus and drip. Vasopressin and
   stress dose steroids also started.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo M with COPD, s/p right pneumonectomy with increasing dyspnea and
   worsening O2 requirement who was found to have a LLL consolidation at
   rehab and was admitted to ICU for hypoxemia, clinical status continuing
   to worsen.
   # Hypoxemia/respiratory distress: Patient with poor reserve given
   recent right pneumonectomy and underlying mild COPD.  Given clinical
   picture and images, likely pneumonia with evolving sepsis and
   complicated by pulmonary embolism and air-fluid level in R
   pneumonectomy cavity s/p chest tube placement.
   -Continue Vanc and azithromycin for PNA, change Zosyn to Meropenem for
   coverage of ESBL
   -F/u pending micro including from bronch
   -Continue heparin gtt for PE, f/u LENIs
   -Chest tube in place; f/u Thoracics recs
   -Steroids discontinued [**4-22**] as COPD likely major component; continue
   standing nebs
   -Increasing PEEP or trial of PS are remaining options in optimizing
   respiratory status
   # Hypotension: Likely with components from sepsis unresponsive to
   current abx, cardiogenic given arrythmia, anatomic given R pleural
   cavity process.
   -Broaden abx coverage as above
   -Continue amiodarone gtt for Afib (can d/c home po dose)
   -Continue chest tube and f/u Thoracics recs
   -Ability to fluid resuscitate limited by respiratory status; can try
   small boluses as tolerated
   -Continue pressors which are currently maxed out; dobutamine would be
   option but run risk of increasing susceptibility to arrhythmia
   # Acute renal failure: Rapid decline
   -Appreciate renal recs
   -Disinclined to offer dialysis as not medically reasonable option given
   overall clinical status
   # Elevated INR: Negative for DIC, may be [**1-26**] shock liver.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who underwent a right pneumonectomy and was admitted to the ICU for worsening hypoxemia and respiratory distress. The patient has a large right pneumonectomy cavity with air-fluid level, which was treated with a chest tube. The patient's clinical status has continued to worsen, with increasing oxygen requirement, hypoxemia, and respiratory distress. The patient has also developed acute renal failure, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's worsening clinical status and increasing oxygen requirement suggest the possibility of sepsis, which may be complicated by pneumonia and pulmonary embolism.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia may progress to respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's rapid decline in renal function may lead to acute renal failure, which may require dialysis.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, cardiogenic shock, or anatomic causes, and may require pressor support and fluid resuscitation.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may be due to cardiogenic shock or sepsis, and may require anticoagulation and rate control medications.
6. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's pulmonary embolism may be a complication of sepsis and pneumonia, and may require anticoagulation therapy.
7. Lung Cancer: The patient's recent diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer may have metastasized, which may require further evaluation and treatment.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's clinical status is worsening, and the plan is to continue antibiotics for pneumonia, anticoagulation therapy for pulmonary embolism, and pressor support for hypotension. The patient's respiratory status is being optimized with mechanical ventilation, and the patient's renal function is being monitored closely. The patient's atrial fibrillation is being treated with anticoagulation therapy and rate control medications. Further evaluation and treatment of the patient's lung cancer are being planned."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male with h/o lung cancer and s/p right pneumonectomy and with
   severe COPD who has significant multi-lobar PNA in the left lung
   leading to respiratory failure and sepsis.  This is complicated by PE,
   Right heart compromise, Atrial Fibrillation, pneumothorax in right
   pneumonectomy space and acute renal failure. Importantly he has had
   conservative ventilation strategy with some improvement in ventilation
   but has had worsening and refractory hypoxemia.  This may be a
   manifestation of worsening impact from pneumonia and lung injury
   despite low Vt ventilation and PEEP optimization in the setting of leak
   into right chest.   By problem will-->
   1)Respiratory Failure
   PNA-_Vancomycin/Zosyn
Change to Meropenem empirically this morning
   COPD--Alb/Atrovent to contiue
   He has ongoing drainage from chest tube but minimal evidence of ongoing
   brisk air leak based upon no air leak in tube an full return volume
   seen.
   Collapse
CXR shows a strong suggestion of LLL consolidation and
   collapse based on CXR and this would be the likely primary driver of
   his worsening hypoxemia with PE less likely.
   PEEP
will increase in the absence of ongoing leak and severe
   hypoxemia
Increase PEEP to 10
   2)Sepsis/Shock-_Despite volume and pressors patient has clear worsening
   of tissue hypo-perfusion with elevations in lactate seen.  This is
   likely sepsis/hypovolemic and cardiogenic at the onset with right heart
   failure
   -Levophed/Vasopressin/Phenylephrine
   -HYdrocortisone IV started for hypotension as empiric intervention with
   refractory shock.
   -Volume replete
CVP at 16
   -Will trial fluild bolus only if refractory to pressors
as he has
   anuria, elevated CVP
   -Are working to control impact of A-fib and impact of PE with Rx as
   below
   -Will repeat blood cultures at this time despite no fevers noted
   3)Acute Renal Failure-_Creatinine continues to rise-this is combination
   of ATN and pre-renal source of failure.  This has persisted and is
   worsening.
   -Continue to support as above
   -No acute need for dialysis but volume overload may be at issue
   4)Pulmonary Embolism-Seen on CT, concern for DVT on right and risk of
   recurrent PE is overwhelming risk of death and heparin started in that
   setting.
   -Heparin to continue
   -Need to F/U on final read of LENI which prelim suggested DVT
   5)Atrial Fibrillation-
   -Will continue with Amiodarone
   -Is incidentally on IV Heparin

at this time patient has severe and progressive
   multi-organ system failure.  This has progressed despite ongoing
   maximal medical therapy in the setting of pre-existing severe
   compromise in function with COPD and pneumonectomy.  Patient wishes as
   expressed are for continued full measures for treatment should there be
   a reasonable expectation of meaningful recovery which has been defined
   as return to independent living status.  Given overwhelming progression
   of multi-organ system failure despite optimal medical interventions
   this recovery would not appear to be reasaonable to expect.  This will

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 75 minutes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of lung cancer and a right pneumonectomy, who has developed severe respiratory failure, sepsis, and acute renal failure. He also has a pulmonary embolism (PE) and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe hypoxemia despite being on mechanical ventilation with a conservative ventilation strategy. He has a CXR showing a strong suggestion of left lower lobe consolidation and collapse, which is likely the primary driver of his worsening hypoxemia.
2. Sepsis and shock: The patient has clear worsening of tissue hypoperfusion, with elevations in lactate levels. He has been treated with vasopressors, hydrocortisone, and fluid repletion, but his condition remains refractory.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level continues to rise, indicating a combination of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and pre-renal failure. He is being supported with fluids and will be monitored for the need for dialysis.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a PE, which is being treated with heparin. He also has a concern for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on the right side.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is being treated with amiodarone.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to remain in the ICU. The total time spent by the healthcare team on his care is 75 minutes.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia may continue to worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise.
2. Sepsis and septic shock: The patient's sepsis may progress to septic shock, which can be life-threatening.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to further kidney damage.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's PE may worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to further cardiac compromise and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Right heart failure: The patient's right heart failure may worsen, leading to further cardiac compromise and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Infection: The patient's sepsis may lead to further infections, which can worsen his condition.
8. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase his risk of bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
9. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac compromise may lead to cardiac arrest, which can be life-threatening.
10. Death: The patient's condition is severe and progressive, and his prognosis is poor. He may die from his underlying condition or complications related to his treatment."
