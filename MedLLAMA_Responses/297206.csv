You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old man admitted to the MICU with an intracranial hemorrhage, specifically a traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and bilateral subcutaneous gas in the lateral temporal soft tissues. The patient's condition has worsened, with new findings including a right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and possible left tentorial subdural hematoma. The patient's vital signs are stable, but his laboratory results are concerning, with a platelet count of 125, hematocrit of 30, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 95, creatinine of 2.0, and international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.3.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to the worsening SAH and intraparenchymal hemorrhage, which may lead to brain herniation and death.
2. Respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying chronic kidney disease (CKD) and potential acute kidney injury (AKI) caused by the SAH and blood transfusions.
3. Cardiac complications, including atrial fibrillation (AF) and coronary artery disease (CAD), which may worsen with the patient's current condition.
4. Infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which may be exacerbated by the patient's immunosuppressed state and prolonged ICU stay.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's chronic use of warfarin and potential bleeding diathesis.
6. Electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, which may worsen the patient's cardiac status and increase the risk of arrhythmias.
7. Renal failure, which may worsen the patient's underlying CKD and increase the risk of AKI.
8. Sepsis, which may develop due to the patient's immunosuppressed state and potential infections.

The patient's treatment plan should focus on managing his SAH, controlling his blood pressure, and preventing further bleeding. Close monitoring of his laboratory results, vital signs, and neurological status is essential to prevent potential complications and improve his outcome."

   CT (~6a): ""little change from 11 hrs prior in multicompartmental
   intracranial hemorrhage""
   Assessment and Plan
   87-year-old man with substantial cardiac history (CAD, Afib on
   warfarin, pacemaker vs. ICD) now presents with traumatic SAH.
   SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE
   - received vitamin K, profiline, and FFP
   - neurosurgery following
   - prelim read of CT after about 11 hours was there was no change; will
   d/w neurosurg
   - BP is well controlled without specific therapy
   - continue dilantin prophylactically
   - will discuss with neurosurgery regarding best approach to monitoring
   and therpay
   SYNCOPE (POSSIBLE)
   - not completely clear if this was syncope or a mechanical fall but
   proceding under assumption that it was.  Certainly EKG and device
   suggests high risk.
   - echo today
   - telemetry
   - infectious workup
   - ask EP to interrogate device
   ARF vs. CKD
   - on darbepoeitin chronically, so suspect there is chronic kidney
   disease as well
   - will attempt to get old records
   CAD
   - hold on aspirin for now until SAH cleared
   AFIB
   - off anticoag for now
   Will attempt to get old records

Summary:

The patient, an 87-year-old man with a substantial cardiac history, was admitted to the MICU after presenting with a traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient's condition has worsened, with new findings of bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage, right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and possible left tentorial subdural hematoma. The patient is receiving vitamin K, profiline, and fresh frozen plasma, and is awaiting neurosurgical consultation. The patient's cardiac history includes coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation on warfarin, and a pacemaker vs. implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

Potential medical complications:

1. Cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure due to the SAH, which may lead to further neurological decline or even death.
2. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease.
3. Respiratory failure, particularly given the patient's age and the potential for respiratory muscle weakness due to the SAH.
4. Renal failure, given the patient's chronic kidney disease and the potential for acute kidney injury due to the SAH or other factors.
5. Infectious complications, such as pneumonia or sepsis, given the patient's age and the potential for respiratory or urinary tract infections.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly given the patient's history of aspirin use and the potential for bleeding complications.
7. Syncope, which may be related to the SAH or other underlying conditions.
8. Cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac tamponade or acute coronary syndrome, given the patient's history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation.

These potential complications will require close monitoring and management to prevent or mitigate their effects on the patient's outcome."

   HEAD CT:
   Slight interval increase in size of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the
   right
   temporoparietal region. Slight increase in the amount of blood layering
   dependently in the lateral ventricles. Otherwise, no interval change.
   Assessment and Plan
   87 year old male with known multiple medical problems (though unclear
   chronicity and level of debility) as well as on chronic anticoagulation
   for AF presenting after a fall today with subarachnoid hemorage.
   Patient remains neurologically intact but as exact mechanism of fall is
   unclear and the  the patient has signs of old CAD he has been admitted
   to medicine for work up and monitoring.
   1) Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Goal SBP's from 100 to 140 per neurosurgery
   and he is staying well there without any particular intervention.
   Coagulation reversed. Neurosurg following.
   -Bblocker for SBP>140 (as tachycardic, and ?in afib vs. MAT), fluids
   for SBP<100; gave fluids last night
   -continue dilantin, level is 16.1 ([**9-14**] is normal range); need repeat
   albumin to further determine level
   -CT head in AM showed some increase in SAH; repeat CT in PM showed very
   little change
   -touch base with neurosurgery to determine need for Q2 neurochecks
   -neurosurgery recs suggest no coumadin for at least 30 days; risk of
   embolus per month is low.  Needs follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1703**]
   ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 8464**]) in 4 weeks, will need noncontrast head CT beforehand.
   .
   2)  Atrial fibrillation
 HRs 70s
 low 100s.
   -Consider beta blockade if HR > 120 but only if can maintain BP goals
   suggested by neurosurgery.
   -Low CHADS score (age and CHF)  so would not resume anti-coag until
   cleared to do  so by neurosurgery
   .
   3) Coagulopathy: Goal INR is 1.3 and currently at goal.
   -Continue to hold coumadin in setting of SAH
   .
   4) Syncope: ?syncopal episode and think patient's lack of memory likely
   due to concussion/head trauma not necessarily loss of consciousness.
   Family provided no additional info.
   -as per EP, no arrhythmic events of pacer
   -UA w/ enterococcus and pt symptomatic. Will start ampicillin
   -Echo subobtimal study- unclear extent of AS, severe LV hypokinesis;
   would consider repeating echo; consulting cardiology in light of echo
   results; should contact outpatient cardiologist regarding cardiac
   surgery
   5) Hypotension: Brief episode of hypotension to 80's in ED that
   responded well to small amount of IV fluids.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   -Monitor
   6) Hx CAD: No signs of active ischemia.  No ASA given bleeding risk and
   no BB given concern for BP in setting of bleed.
   -CE stable x 3 sets
   -severe LV hypokinesis- cardiology consult
   7) CKD?: Patient is on darbepoetin which raises suspicion of CKD.  Will
   attempt to obtain outside records to verify.  Also possible some
   element of prerenal given fluid responsive hypotension.
   -Trend Cr, avoid nephrotoxins
   8) FEN: Replete lytes PRN, NPO for now
   9) PPx: Pneumoboots, Oral PPI
   10) Code: Full
   11) Dispo: pending neuro stability

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male admitted to the ICU for workup and monitoring after a fall with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). He has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF), chronic anticoagulation, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He is currently on a beta blocker (lopressor) to control his heart rate, and his anticoagulation has been reversed. His SAH is stable, and he is being monitored closely by neurosurgery.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: Given the patient's history of anticoagulation and SAH, there is a risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of hypertension or hypotension.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's AF is being monitored, and beta blockade is being considered to control his heart rate. However, there is a risk of arrhythmic events, particularly in the setting of hypertension or hypotension.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is currently at goal, but there is a risk of coagulopathy due to his SAH and anticoagulation status.
4. Syncope: The patient's syncopal episode is unclear, and there is a risk of further episodes, particularly in the setting of hypertension or hypotension.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension episode in the ED responded well to fluids, but there is a risk of further episodes, particularly in the setting of bleeding or coagulopathy.
6. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's darbepoetin use raises suspicion of CKD, and there is a risk of further kidney damage due to nephrotoxins or inadequate fluid management.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia risk is high due to his age, CAD, and anticoagulation status.
8. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: The patient's risk of VAP is high due to his prolonged mechanical ventilation and anticoagulation status.
9. Deep Vein Thrombosis: The patient's risk of DVT is high due to his immobility and anticoagulation status.
10. Stress Ulcer: The patient's risk of stress ulcer is high due to his critical illness and anticoagulation status."

   24 Hour Events:
   -cardiology was consulted regarding his weird bypass of AoV. They said:
   re afib (would bblock if HR >120, aiming for bp per neurosurg). ok to
   not be on coumadin for afib. Re bypass graft ask [**Hospital1 49**] why it was placed,
   but regardless, would not anticoagulate for now. Monitor for emboli to
   legs as this is where they would go from the conduit. also give lasix
   for chf.
   -cards wanted op report from [**Hospital1 **] which is now in his chart under osh
   records. the op procedure was left thoracotomy and left ventricular
   apex-to-descending aortic valve conduit.
   -started lopressor 12.5 tid for goal HR <120s and goal SBP 100-140,
   could titrate up prn or switch to carvedilol (his home med). I liked
   that lopressor was a little shorter acting for now.
   -neurosurg would like head CT in am before their rounds rather than
   this evening. will need to talk to neurosurg at some point soon about
   when to restart coumadin.
   -called micro lab to confirm they are testing sensitivities on
   enterococcus from urine, which they are
   -per daughter, pt on O2 at baseline and incontinent at home. may need
   to go to [**Hospital1 **] after discharge

   Assessment and Plan
   87 year old male with known multiple medical problems (though unclear
   chronicity and level of debility) as well as on chronic anticoagulation
   for AF presenting after a fall today with subarachnoid hemorage.
   Patient remains neurologically intact but as exact mechanism of fall is
   unclear and the  the patient has signs of old CAD he has been admitted
   to medicine for work up and monitoring.
   1) Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Goal SBP's from 100 to 140 per neurosurgery
   and he is staying well there without any particular intervention.
   Coagulation reversed. Neurosurg following.
   -Bblocker for SBP>140 (as tachycardic, and ?in afib vs. MAT), fluids
   for SBP<100; gave fluids last night
   -continue dilantin, level is 16.1 ([**9-14**] is normal range)
   -CT head in AM showed some increase in SAH; repeat CT in PM showed very
   little change
   -Q2 neuro checks and repeat head CT this PM
   -will have to consult with neurosurg/cards in future regarding
   necessity of anticoagulation in long term for graft. Definitely should
   not be on coumadin in short term given extent of bleed.
   -Consider adding calcium channel blocker to prevent vasospasm
   2) Coagulopathy: Goal INR is 1.3.  Now reversed to 1.2 s/p 2 units FFP
   -will continue to hold coumadin in setting of SAH
   3) Syncope: ?syncopal episode and think patient's lack of memory likely
   due to concussion/head trauma not necessarily loss of consciousness.
   Family provided no additional info.
   -as per EP, no arrhythmic events of pacer
   -UA w/ enterococcus and pt symptomatic. Will start ampicillin
   -Echo subobtimal study- unclear extent of AS, severe LV hypokinesis;
   would consider repeating echo; consulting cardiology in light of echo
   results; should contact outpatient cardiologist regarding cardiac
   surgery
   4) Hypotension: Brief episode of hypotension to 80's in ED that
   responded well to small amount of IV fluids.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   -Monitor
   5) Hx CAD: No signs of active ischemia.  No ASA given bleeding risk and
   no BB given concern for BP in setting of bleed.
   -CE stable x 3 sets

   6) CKD?: Patient is on darbepoetin which raises suspicion of CKD.  Will
   attempt to obtain outside records to verify.  Also possible some

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient remains neurologically intact but as exact mechanism of fall is
   unclear and the  the patient has signs of old CAD he has been admitted
   to medicine for work up and monitoring.
   1) Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Goal SBP's from 100 to 140 per neurosurgery
   and he is staying well there without any particular intervention.
   Coagulation reversed. Neurosurg following.
   -Bblocker for SBP>140 (as tachycardic, and ?in afib vs. MAT), fluids
   for SBP<100; gave fluids last night
   -continue dilantin, level is 16.1 ([**9-14**] is normal range)
   -CT head in AM showed some increase in SAH; repeat CT in PM showed very
   little change
   -Q2 neuro checks and repeat head CT this PM
   -will have to consult with neurosurg/cards in future regarding
   necessity of anticoagulation in long term for graft. Definitely should
   not be on coumadin in short term given extent of bleed.
   -Consider adding calcium channel blocker to prevent vasospasm
   2) Coagulopathy: Goal INR is 1.3.  Now reversed to 1.2 s/p 2 units FFP
   -will continue to hold coumadin in setting of SAH
   3) Syncope: ?syncopal episode and think patient's lack of memory likely
   due to concussion/head trauma not necessarily loss of consciousness.
   Family provided no additional info.
   -as per EP, no arrhythmic events of pacer
   -UA w/ enterococcus and pt symptomatic. Will start ampicillin
   -Echo subobtimal study- unclear extent of AS, severe LV hypokinesis;
   would consider repeating echo; consulting cardiology in light of echo
   results; should contact outpatient cardiologist regarding cardiac
   surgery
   4) Hypotension: Brief episode of hypotension to 80's in ED that
   responded well to small amount of IV fluids.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   -Monitor
   5) Hx CAD: No signs of active ischemia.  No ASA given bleeding risk and
   no BB given concern for BP in setting of bleed.
   -CE stable x 3 sets
   -severe LV hypokinesis- cardiology consult
   6) CKD?: Patient is on darbepoetin which raises suspicion of CKD.  Will
   attempt to obtain outside records to verify.  Also possible some
   element of prerenal given fluid responsive hypotension.
   -Trend Cr, avoid nephrotoxins
   7) FEN: Replete lytes PRN, NPO for now

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) after a fall, and is known to have multiple medical problems, including atrial fibrillation (AF) and chronic anticoagulation. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T=37°C (98.6°F), HR=104 bpm, BP=123/78 mmHg, SpO2=96%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Cardiac rhythm is AF, and the patient is being monitored for emboli to the legs due to the bypass graft.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received 1,940 mL of fluid and has lost 1,125 mL of urine, resulting in a positive balance of 815 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen via nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 96%.
* Physical examination: The patient's peripheral vascular examination is incomplete, and the skin and neurologic examinations are not assessed.
* Labs/Radiology: The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and hemoglobin (Hb) level, and a decreased platelet count (Plt). The patient's creatinine (Cr) level is elevated, and the troponin-T (TropT) level is slightly elevated. The patient's head CT scan shows a slight interval increase in the size of the intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right temporoparietal region.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Vasospasm: The patient's SAH increases the risk of vasospasm, which can lead to cerebral ischemia and infarction.
2. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and the presence of a foreign body (bypass graft) increase the risk of infection.
3. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and the presence of a bleeding disorder (SAH) increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's AF and chronic anticoagulation increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as atrial flutter or fibrillation.
5. Renal failure: The patient's elevated Cr level and decreased Plt count increase the risk of renal failure.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen requirement and the presence of a foreign body (bypass graft) increase the risk of respiratory failure.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's SAH and the presence of a foreign body (bypass graft) increase the risk of neurological complications, such as cerebral edema or infarction.

To address these potential complications, the patient's care plan should include:

1. Monitoring for vasospasm and treating accordingly.
2. Administering antibiotics to prevent infection.
3. Maintaining a tight blood pressure control to prevent bleeding.
4. Managing the patient's cardiac rhythm to prevent cardiac complications.
5. Monitoring the patient's renal function and adjusting medications accordingly.
6. Providing respiratory support as needed.
7. Monitoring the patient's neurological status and treating accordingly.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   re afib (would bblock if HR >120, aiming for bp per neurosurg). ok to
   not be on coumadin for afib. Re bypass graft ask [**Hospital1 49**] why it was placed,
   but regardless, would not anticoagulate for now. Monitor for emboli to
   legs as this is where they would go from the conduit. also give lasix
   for chf.
   -cards wanted op report from [**Hospital1 **] which is now in his chart under osh
   records. the op procedure was left thoracotomy and left ventricular
   apex-to-descending aortic valve conduit.
   -started lopressor 12.5 tid for goal HR <120s and goal SBP 100-140,
   could titrate up prn or switch to carvedilol (his home med). I liked
   that lopressor was a little shorter acting for now.
   -neurosurg would like head CT in am before their rounds rather than
   this evening. will need to talk to neurosurg at some point soon about
   when to restart coumadin.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 year old male with known multiple medical problems (though unclear
   chronicity and level of debility) as well as on chronic anticoagulation
   for AF presenting after a fall today with subarachnoid hemorage.
   Patient remains neurologically intact but as exact mechanism of fall is
   unclear and the  the patient has signs of old CAD he has been admitted
   to medicine for work up and monitoring.
   1) Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Goal SBP's from 100 to 140 per neurosurgery
   and he is staying well there without any particular intervention.
   Coagulation reversed. Neurosurg following.

   -will have to consult with neurosurg/cards in future regarding
   necessity of anticoagulation in long term for graft. Definitely should
   not be on coumadin in short term given extent of bleed.
   -Consider adding calcium channel blocker to prevent vasospasm
   .
   2)  Atrial fibrillation
 HRs 70s
 low 100s.
   -Consider beta blockade if HR > 120 but only if can maintain BP goals
   suggested by neurosurgery.
   -Low CHADS score (age and CHF)  so would not resume anti-coag until
   cleared to do  so by neurosurgery
   .
   3) Coagulopathy: Goal INR is 1.3 and currently at goal.
   -Continue to hold coumadin in setting of SAH
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   .
   HEAD CT:
   Slight interval increase in size of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the
   right
   temporoparietal region. Slight increase in the amount of blood layering
   dependently in the lateral ventricles. Otherwise, no interval change.
   Assessment and Plan
   87 year old male with known multiple medical problems (though unclear
   chronicity and level of debility) as well as on chronic anticoagulation
   for AF presenting after a fall today with subarachnoid hemorage.
   Patient remains neurologically intact but as exact mechanism of fall is
   unclear and the  the patient has signs of old CAD he has been admitted
   to medicine for work up and monitoring.
   1) Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Goal SBP's from 100 to 140 per neurosurgery
   and he is staying well there without any particular intervention.
   Coagulation reversed. Neurosurg following.
   -Bblocker for SBP>140 (as tachycardic, and ?in afib vs. MAT), fluids
   for SBP<100; gave fluids last night
   -continue dilantin, level is 16.1 ([**9-14**] is normal range)
   -CT head in AM showed some increase in SAH; repeat CT in PM showed very
   little change
   -Q2 neuro checks and repeat head CT this PM
   -will have to consult with neurosurg/cards in future regarding
   necessity of anticoagulation in long term for graft. Definitely should
   not be on coumadin in short term given extent of bleed.
   -Consider adding calcium channel blocker to prevent vasospasm
   .
   2)  Atrial fibrillation
 HRs 70s
 low 100s.
   -Consider beta blockade if HR > 120 but only if can maintain BP goals
   suggested by neurosurgery.
   -Low CHADS score (age and CHF)  so would not resume anti-coag until
   cleared to do  so by neurosurgery
   .
   3) Coagulopathy: Goal INR is 1.3 and currently at goal.
   -Continue to hold coumadin in setting of SAH
   .
   4) Syncope: ?syncopal episode and think patient's lack of memory likely
   due to concussion/head trauma not necessarily loss of consciousness.
   Family provided no additional info.
   -as per EP, no arrhythmic events of pacer
   -UA w/ enterococcus and pt symptomatic. Will start ampicillin
   -Echo subobtimal study- unclear extent of AS, severe LV hypokinesis;
   would consider repeating echo; consulting cardiology in light of echo
   results; should contact outpatient cardiologist regarding cardiac
   surgery
   5) Hypotension: Brief episode of hypotension to 80's in ED that
   responded well to small amount of IV fluids.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   -Monitor
   6) Hx CAD: No signs of active ischemia.  No ASA given bleeding risk and
   no BB given concern for BP in setting of bleed.
   -CE stable x 3 sets
   -severe LV hypokinesis- cardiology consult
   7) CKD?: Patient is on darbepoetin which raises suspicion of CKD.  Will
   attempt to obtain outside records to verify.  Also possible some
   element of prerenal given fluid responsive hypotension.
   -Trend Cr, avoid nephrotoxins
   8) FEN: Replete lytes PRN, NPO for now
   9) PPx: Pneumoboots, Oral PPI
   10) Code: Full
   11) Dispo: pending neuro stability

Summary:

The patient, an 87-year-old male with known multiple medical problems, was admitted to the ICU with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) after a fall. He is currently in atrial fibrillation (AF) and has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD). He underwent a left thoracotomy and left ventricular apex-to-descending aortic valve conduit procedure at [**Hospital1**]. The patient is receiving anticoagulation reversal therapy and is being monitored for potential emboli to the legs.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 104 bpm and blood pressure of 123/78 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 96% on nasal cannula. His laboratory results show an elevated troponin-T level, indicating possible cardiac damage. His head CT scan shows a slight increase in the size of the intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right temporoparietal region.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and current AF may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.
2. Neurological complications: The patient's SAH and history of fall may increase his risk of neurological complications, such as brain edema, hydrocephalus, or stroke.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's anticoagulation reversal therapy may increase his risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or hematuria.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to his underlying lung disease, pneumonia, or respiratory failure.
5. Renal complications: The patient's history of CKD and possible prerenal azotemia may increase his risk of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease progression.
6. Infection: The patient's enterococcus infection and possible pneumonia may increase his risk of sepsis or septic shock.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and possible stress ulceration may increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.
8. Thromboembolic complications: The patient's AF and history of CAD may increase his risk of thromboembolic complications, such as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is essential to monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies closely to identify any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent or treat them."
