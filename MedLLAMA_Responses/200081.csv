You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 69-year-old male, is a post-subdural hematoma evacuation patient who has developed massive bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He is currently in the ICU due to hypotension and fevers. The patient's condition is complex, with multiple potential complications and uncertainties.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a large PE with evidence of right heart dysfunction, which can lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
2. Sepsis: The patient's high fever and rigors suggest bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's CXR shows new LLL infiltrate, which may represent aspiration, atelectasis, or pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure.
4. Abscess or Infarction: The fluid collection in the left hip abductor area may represent a hematoma, abscess, or muscular infarction, which can lead to further complications, such as sepsis or organ failure.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and BUN levels suggest potential renal failure, which can be exacerbated by the patient's underlying medical conditions and medications.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's abdominal ileus and distension may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or bowel obstruction.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's subdural hematoma evacuation and potential bleeding complications may lead to neurological deficits or worsening of existing neurological symptoms.

Recommendations:

1. Continue heparin gtt and coumadin to manage the patient's PE and DVT.
2. Continue cefepime and vancomycin for the patient's suspected sepsis.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac and respiratory status closely, and consider further imaging or interventions as needed.
4. Consider further imaging of the fluid collection in the left hip abductor area to determine the cause and extent of the collection.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider further interventions, such as dialysis, if necessary.
6. Consider speech and swallow consult to assess the patient's swallowing function and risk of aspiration.
7. Advance the patient's diet per speech and swallow consult, and consider further bowel regimen as needed.
8. Monitor the patient's abdominal status and consider further interventions, such as nasogastric suction or bowel obstruction management, if necessary."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of recent subdural hematoma evacuation who presents with massive bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), now with fevers. The patient's vital signs include:

* Temperature: 105°F (38.5°C)
* Heart rate: 86 bpm
* Blood pressure: 114/53 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 92%

The patient has a new left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray (CXR) and a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) shows bilateral filling defects in the pulmonary arteries, consistent with PE. The patient also has a fluid collection in the left hip abductor area, which may be a hematoma or abscess.

The patient has received antibiotics, including cefepime and vancomycin, and is being treated with heparin for DVT and coumadin for PE. The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.4 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 116 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 20 mg/dL
* Glucose: 129 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Overweight/obese, anxious, and diaphoretic
* Cardiovascular: Normal sinus rhythm with widely split second heart sound
* Respiratory: Crackles in both lungs, with bibasilar distribution
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, and distended
* Extremities: Right and left lower extremity edema (trace)

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Pulmonary embolism: Large and potentially life-threatening, requiring close monitoring and potential thrombolysis
* Sepsis: High fever and rigors suggest bacteremia, which may lead to septic shock and multi-organ failure
* Abscess formation: Fluid collection in the left hip abductor area may develop into an abscess, requiring further imaging and potentially surgical intervention
* Pneumonia: Aspiration or infectious etiology may develop, requiring antibiotic adjustments and potential imaging studies
* Renal failure: Elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels may indicate renal impairment, requiring close monitoring and potential dialysis
* Cardiovascular instability: Hypotension and tachycardia may indicate cardiac compromise, requiring close monitoring and potential intervention

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings closely, and to adjust treatment accordingly. Further imaging studies, such as a CT scan or MRI, may be necessary to evaluate the fluid collection in the left hip abductor area and to rule out abscess formation. The patient's antibiotics should be adjusted based on the results of his blood and urine cultures."

   Imaging: [**3-2**] - left femoral ultrasound
   FINDINGS: A 3.9 cm x 2.7 cm x 1.9 cm hypoechoic lesion in the
   subcutaneous
   tissue at the left groin just superomedial to the femoral vessels is
   consistent with hematoma. Patent flow is identified in the left common
   femoral artery and left common femoral vein on color and Doppler
   imaging. No
   pseudoaneurysm is seen arising from the left common femoral artery, and
   there
   is no evidence of arteriovenous fistula at this site.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Hematoma at the left groin.
   2. No evidence of pseudoaneurysm arising from the left common femoral
   artery.
   Echo [**3-2**]:
   Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
   size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The RV is now well seen
   but appears normal in size (function cannot be adequately assessed on
   this study). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
   aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid regurgitation is
   present but cannot be quantified. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-2-21**], RV
   apppears smaller however images are of poor quality.
   [**3-1**]: CT thorax
   1. New multifocal areas of ground-glass opacity within bilateral lung
   parenchyma most compatible with infectious etiology.
   2. Mildly decreased extent of bilateral pulmonary embolism within the
   right
   and left pulmonary arteries extending into the segmental and
   subsegmental
   branches.
   3. Fluid collection and enlargement of the left hip abductor muscles
   may
   represent hematoma, abscess, or infarction. This is also at the
   location of
   previous interventions in the left groin for IVC filter placement.
   Clinical
   correlation is recommended. In case of clinical concern for abscess
   formation, an MRI can be obtained for further evaluation.

   # Pulmonary embolism: Large with evidence of right heart dysfunction.
   Pressures have remained stable so far. On heparin gtt and coumadin
   currently. Also has IVC filter inplace. If becomes hypotensive and not
   responsive to fluids may have to thrombolyse, which puts head at risk.
   -          hold coumadin as INR is elevated today, re-check INR
   tomorrow.
   -          breakup of PE may also be the cause of his fevers, and his
   hypoxia.
   # Fever: Unclear source but very high fever. ?pulmonary with LLL
   infiltrates on CXR. CTA did not show very large pneumonia or
   aspiration. Rigors suggesting bacteremia.  Hip fluid collection may
   also be an abscess for source of fevers with infected prosthesis.  The
   patient appears to be improving on current antibiotics, however if he
   worsens again the hip will need to be aspirated.

   the diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan outlined above.
   Approximately 50% allocated time involved coordination of care.
   MEDICAL DECISION MAKING.  This 69 year old man with a history of DVT
   and PE developed a subdural hematoma while on oral warfarin therapy.
   While off warfarin, he developed a saddle pulmonary embolus.  An IVC
   filter was placed.  He was made a slow recovery but recently developed
   a temperature to 105 (now 101) without obvious source of the
   infection.  The likely sources are pulmonary or a potential for a left
   hip abscess.  On examination today, there was much less hip tenderness
   and the abdomen is soft in the LLQ.  He has rales bilaterally and we
   will add diuresis with furosemide to day to obtain approximately
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 264**] cc negative.  We will continue his current medical therapy
   with antibiotics and assess his symptomatic response.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of recent subdural hematoma, massive bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He was treated with heparin and coumadin, and an IVC filter was placed. Recently, he developed a fever without an obvious source of infection, and a hip fluid collection was noted. Imaging studies showed a hematoma at the left groin, no evidence of pseudoaneurysm, and bilateral lung opacities compatible with infectious etiology.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Infection:** The patient's fever and lack of obvious source of infection suggest the possibility of a pulmonary or hip abscess. The patient's current antibiotics may need to be adjusted or continued, and further imaging studies may be necessary to determine the source of the infection.
2. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE):** The patient's massive PE may lead to recurrent episodes, which can be life-threatening. Close monitoring and consideration of thrombolytic therapy may be necessary.
3. **Right Heart Dysfunction:** The patient's right heart dysfunction may worsen if the PE is not adequately treated, leading to cardiogenic shock and death.
4. **Septic Hip:** The patient's hip fluid collection may be an abscess or hematoma, which can lead to septicemia and further complications if not properly treated.
5. **Renal Failure:** The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output may indicate impending renal failure, which can be exacerbated by the patient's underlying conditions.
6. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient's history of subdural hematoma and PE may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
7. **Inadequate Anticoagulation:** The patient's INR is elevated, which may indicate inadequate anticoagulation. This may increase the risk of recurrent PE and DVT.

**Plan:**

The patient's current medical therapy, including antibiotics and diuresis, should be continued and monitored for symptomatic response. Further imaging studies and laboratory tests may be necessary to determine the source of the infection and monitor the patient's progress. Close coordination with the patient's care team, including the orthopedic and neurosurgical services, is essential to ensure optimal care and management of the patient's complex medical conditions."

   FINDINGS: A 3.9 cm x 2.7 cm x 1.9 cm hypoechoic lesion in the
   subcutaneous
   tissue at the left groin just superomedial to the femoral vessels is
   consistent with hematoma. Patent flow is identified in the left common
   femoral artery and left common femoral vein on color and Doppler
   imaging. No
   pseudoaneurysm is seen arising from the left common femoral artery, and
   there
   is no evidence of arteriovenous fistula at this site.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Hematoma at the left groin.
   2. No evidence of pseudoaneurysm arising from the left common femoral
   artery.
   Echo [**3-2**]:
   Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
   size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The RV is now well seen
   but appears normal in size (function cannot be adequately assessed on
   this study). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
   aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid regurgitation is
   present but cannot be quantified. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-2-21**], RV
   apppears smaller however images are of poor quality.
   [**3-1**]: CT thorax
   1. New multifocal areas of ground-glass opacity within bilateral lung
   parenchyma most compatible with infectious etiology.
   2. Mildly decreased extent of bilateral pulmonary embolism within the
   right
   and left pulmonary arteries extending into the segmental and
   subsegmental
   branches.
   3. Fluid collection and enlargement of the left hip abductor muscles
   may
   represent hematoma, abscess, or infarction. This is also at the
   location of
   previous interventions in the left groin for IVC filter placement.
   Clinical
   correlation is recommended. In case of clinical concern for abscess
   formation, an MRI can be obtained for further evaluation.

   -          hold coumadin as INR is elevated today, re-check INR
   tomorrow.
   -          breakup of PE may also be the cause of his fevers, and his
   hypoxia.
   # Fever: Unclear source but very high fever. ?pulmonary with LLL
   infiltrates on CXR. CTA did not show very large pneumonia or
   aspiration. Rigors suggesting bacteremia.  Hip fluid collection may
   also be an abscess for source of fevers with infected prosthesis.  The
   patient appears to be improving on current antibiotics, however if he
   worsens again the hip will need to be aspirated.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of recent subdural hematoma, s/p evacuation, presenting with massive bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient has developed worsening left hip/thigh pain, and orthopedic consultation was performed, suggesting septic hip. Aspiration by interventional radiology (IR) was attempted, but the IR thinks it's not possible while the patient is anticoagulated.

The patient has been experiencing fevers, with temperatures up to 102°F, and rigors, but no focal source of infection was found with cultures and imaging from the morning. Flagyl was added for anaerobic coverage due to continued fevers.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 9.4 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.1 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 116 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 23 mEq/L
* Sodium (Na): 115 mEq/L
* Potassium (K): 4.1 mEq/L
* Glucose: 129 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 2.5 mmol/L
* Lactic acid: 2.5 mmol/L

The patient's imaging studies show:

* A 3.9 cm x 2.7 cm x 1.9 cm hypoechoic lesion in the subcutaneous tissue at the left groin, consistent with hematoma.
* No evidence of pseudoaneurysm arising from the left common femoral artery.
* CT thorax shows multifocal areas of ground-glass opacity within bilateral lung parenchyma, compatible with infectious etiology.
* Mildly decreased extent of bilateral pulmonary embolism within the right and left pulmonary arteries.
* Fluid collection and enlargement of the left hip abductor muscles, which may represent hematoma, abscess, or infarction.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications are:

1. Hematoma at the left groin.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE) with evidence of right heart dysfunction.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
4. Fever of unknown origin, with possible sources including pulmonary, hip fluid collection, or infected prosthesis.
5. Abdominal ileus.
6. Hypertension.
7. Hyperlipidemia.
8. Subdural hematoma, stable per neuro checks.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continue antibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin) for now.
2. Follow up blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures.
3. Attempt to aspirate the hip fluid collection if the patient worsens.
4. Continue prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
5. Advance diet and bowel regimen.
6. Hold antihypertensives for now.
7. Continue statin for hyperlipidemia.

   Imaging: [**3-2**] - left femoral ultrasound
   FINDINGS: A 3.9 cm x 2.7 cm x 1.9 cm hypoechoic lesion in the
   subcutaneous
   tissue at the left groin just superomedial to the femoral vessels is
   consistent with hematoma. Patent flow is identified in the left common
   femoral artery and left common femoral vein on color and Doppler
   imaging. No
   pseudoaneurysm is seen arising from the left common femoral artery, and
   there
   is no evidence of arteriovenous fistula at this site.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Hematoma at the left groin.
   2. No evidence of pseudoaneurysm arising from the left common femoral
   artery.
   Echo [**3-2**]:
   Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
   size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The RV is now well seen
   but appears normal in size (function cannot be adequately assessed on
   this study). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
   aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid regurgitation is
   present but cannot be quantified. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-2-21**], RV
   apppears smaller however images are of poor quality.
   [**3-1**]: CT thorax
   1. New multifocal areas of ground-glass opacity within bilateral lung
   parenchyma most compatible with infectious etiology.
   2. Mildly decreased extent of bilateral pulmonary embolism within the
   right
   and left pulmonary arteries extending into the segmental and
   subsegmental
   branches.
   3. Fluid collection and enlargement of the left hip abductor muscles
   may
   represent hematoma, abscess, or infarction. This is also at the
   location of
   previous interventions in the left groin for IVC filter placement.
   Clinical
   correlation is recommended. In case of clinical concern for abscess
   formation, an MRI can be obtained for further evaluation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: Saddle PEs
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient developed worsening lt hip/thigh pain.  Ortho consulted due
   to concern for septic prosthetic joint.   Ortho thinks exam is
   concerning for septic hip.  Rec aspiration by IR (but IR thinks it's
   not possible while anticoagulated).  Hip X-rays also obtained.
   - Ultrasound of previous fluid collection obtained and was consistent
   with hematoma.
   - Patient in the evening had temp up to 102 and was rigoring.  No focal
   source of infection found with cultures/imaging from morning rigoring
   session.
   - Flagyl added for aneorobic coverage due to continued fevers.
   - TTE showed improvement in right heart size with EF of 50-55%.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of recent subdural hematoma, presenting with massive bilateral pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. He has developed worsening left hip/thigh pain, concern for septic prosthetic joint, and aspiration by IR. Ultrasound of previous fluid collection is consistent with hematoma. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, but the source of infection remains unclear. He has developed fever, rigors, and is at risk for sepsis. The patient's right heart size has improved, and his left ventricular function is low normal. He has mild respiratory failure, and his oxygen saturation is 98%. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, rigors, and unclear source of infection put him at risk for sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's massive bilateral pulmonary embolism can lead to respiratory failure, hypoxia, and death.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis: The patient's deep vein thrombosis can lead to post-thrombotic syndrome, pulmonary embolism, and death.
4. Septic Prosthetic Joint: The patient's worsening left hip/thigh pain and concern for septic prosthetic joint put him at risk for sepsis, joint infection, and amputation.
5. Hematoma: The patient's hematoma in the left groin can lead to bleeding, infection, and organ damage.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's mild respiratory failure can worsen with continued respiratory compromise, leading to hypoxia and death.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's low normal left ventricular function and right heart dysfunction put him at risk for cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
8. Infection: The patient's unclear source of infection and history of recent surgery put him at risk for surgical site infection, bacteremia, and sepsis.
9. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's underlying medical conditions, such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia, put him at risk for organ dysfunction, including kidney, liver, and cardiac failure.
10. Mortality: The patient's complex medical condition, including pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and sepsis, puts him at risk for mortality."
