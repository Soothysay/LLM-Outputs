You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female admitted with altered mental status in the setting of recent fungal septic arthritis. She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions.

The patient's primary diagnoses are:

1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)
2. Hypertension, benign
3. Alcohol withdrawal (including delirium tremens, DTS, seizures)

The patient is experiencing:

* Confusion
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Hypertension
* Tachycardia
* Agitation
* Acidosis
* Electrolyte imbalance

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC count: 13.1 K/uL
* Hct: 33.6%
* Plt: 362 K/uL
* Cr: 1.0 mg/dL
* Glucose: 194 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 12.5/20.6/1.1, Lactic Acid: 1.4, Ca++: 9.1 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.3 mg/dL, PO4: 0.8 mg/dL

The patient's medical complications include:

* DKA
* Hypertension
* Acidosis
* Electrolyte imbalance
* Potential for seizures, hypertensive urgency/emergency, meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, substance abuse withdrawal, and toxic metabolic due to acidosis

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue antibiotic coverage for meningitis
* Continue ativan and haldol for agitation
* Continue insulin drip for acidosis and transition to lantus
* Supplement electrolytes (K and phos)
* Monitor and manage hypertension
* Continue to monitor and manage DKA
* Consider TTE to rule out endocarditis
* Consider ophthalmic evaluation to rule out endocarditis
* Inform ID and ortho teams

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, confusion, nausea, and vomiting. She has a history of recent fungal septic arthritis and is suspected to have diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hypertension, and alcohol withdrawal. She is currently receiving antibiotics, insulin, and IV fluids. Her laboratory results show acidosis, likely due to DKA or starvation ketosis, with positive ketones on urine analysis. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) and computed tomography (CT) scan of the head are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizures: The patient is at risk for seizures due to her history of seizures and the presence of acidosis.
2. Meningitis or Encephalitis: The patient's lumbar puncture (LP) results and cultures are pending, and she may be at risk for meningitis or encephalitis.
3. Stroke: The patient's CT scan of the head is pending, and she may be at risk for stroke.
4. Hypertensive Emergency: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and she may be at risk for hypertensive emergency.
5. DKA: The patient's acidosis and positive ketones on urine analysis suggest DKA, which can lead to severe complications if not treated promptly.
6. Infection: The patient's fungal septic arthritis and positive cultures suggest infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure if not treated promptly.
7. Endocarditis: The patient's septic knee and positive cultures suggest endocarditis, which can lead to serious complications if not treated promptly.
8. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's acidosis and electrolyte imbalance can lead to serious complications if not treated promptly.
9. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and seizure history suggest neurological complications, which can lead to serious outcomes if not treated promptly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Continue to provide antibiotics, insulin, and IV fluids as prescribed.
3. Consider consulting a neurologist or infectious disease specialist for further management.
4. Consider ordering additional laboratory tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC), electrolyte panel, and liver function tests (LFTs), to monitor the patient's condition.
5. Consider ordering an echocardiogram to assess the patient's valves.
6. Consider ordering an MRI/MRA and EEG to assess the patient's brain and nervous system.
7. Consider ordering a repeat LP to assess the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and to rule out meningitis or encephalitis.
8. Consider consulting a cardiologist to assess the patient's cardiac status and to rule out endocarditis."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 47 year old female with a history of type II
   diabetes on insulin, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and
   recent admission for septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**]
   parapsilosis who presents from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal, although she does not have a
   history of delirium tremens.  Other potential etiologies include
   primary neurologic disorders related to the findings on head CT
   (multiple areas of hypodensities) versus infection.  Many systemic
   causes now ruled out including liver, lung, renal disorders, thyroid,
   electrolyte abnormalities.  Diabetic ketoacidosis has now resolved.
   All cultures negative to date including CSF and mycolytic cultures.
   HSV PCR pending from CSF.  Echocardiogram negative for vegetation.
   - LP without clear signs of infection, culture pending, HSV PCR pending
   - Thiamine, folate, multivitamin
   - Ativan 2-4 mg IV Q2H:PRN CIWA > 10 for alcohol withdrawal
   - Awaiting MRI/MRA brain
   - EEG performed yesterday, no results yet
   - F/u Neurologic recs
   - Vancomycin, gentamycin, acyclovir, fluconazole for empiric coverage
   of meningitis pending negative culture results x 48 h
   - follow up blood, urine, mycolytic cultures
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 13.  Electrolytes stable.
   - holding oral agents
   -  continue home insulin regimen of lantus and humalog sliding scale;
   titrate prn
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn
   Hypertension: Blood presusres grossly elevated on presentation. Concern
   given new onset tachycardiac that this may be related to alcohol versus
   benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - hydralazine 10 mg IV Q6H djscontinued
   - restarted home meds today (lisinopril, metoprolol,
   hydrochlorothiazide)
   - ativan for CIWA scale
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and a recent admission for a septic right knee infection. She presents with altered mental status, unclear etiology, and multiple areas of hypodensities on her head CT scan. She has been treated with fluconazole for fungal infection and has had multiple cultures taken, all of which have been negative. She is currently receiving insulin, antibiotics, and antifungals.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Meningitis: The patient's altered mental status and negative cultures may indicate meningitis, which requires further investigation and treatment.
2. Fungal infection: The patient's fungal knee infection may be spreading to other areas of the body, requiring prompt treatment and monitoring.
3. Endocarditis: The patient's recent admission for a septic right knee infection and the presence of a native knee infection may indicate endocarditis, which requires further investigation and treatment.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and the presence of multiple areas of hypodensities on her head CT scan may indicate neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures, which require prompt treatment and monitoring.
5. Infection-related sepsis: The patient's septic right knee infection and the presence of multiple cultures may indicate infection-related sepsis, which requires prompt treatment and monitoring.
6. Bloodstream infection: The patient's fungal knee infection and the presence of multiple cultures may indicate a bloodstream infection, which requires prompt treatment and monitoring.
7. Liver or renal failure: The patient's history of hepatitis C and the presence of multiple cultures may indicate liver or renal failure, which requires prompt treatment and monitoring.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's history of diabetes and the presence of multiple cultures may indicate electrolyte imbalance, which requires prompt treatment and monitoring.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may indicate thrombocytopenia, which requires prompt treatment and monitoring.
10. Infection-related respiratory failure: The patient's septic right knee infection and the presence of multiple cultures may indicate infection-related respiratory failure, which requires prompt treatment and monitoring."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 47 year old female with a history of type II
   diabetes on insulin, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and
   recent admission for septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**]
   parapsilosis who presents from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal, although she does not have a
   history of delirium tremens.  Other potential etiologies include
   primary neurologic disorders related to the findings on head CT
   (multiple areas of hypodensities) versus infection.  Many systemic
   causes now ruled out including liver, lung, renal disorders, thyroid,
   electrolyte abnormalities.  Diabetic ketoacidosis has now resolved.
   All cultures negative to date including CSF and mycolytic cultures.
   HSV PCR pending from CSF.   Echocardiogram negative for vegetation.
   - LP without clear signs of infection, culture pending, HSV PCR pending
   - Thiamine, folate, multivitamin
   - Ativan 2-4 mg IV Q2H:PRN CIWA > 10 for alcohol withdrawal
   - MRI/MRA of brain pending
   - EEG performed yesterday, no results yet
   - Neurologic consult
   - Vancomycin, gentamycin, acyclovir, fluconazole for empiric coverage
   of meningitis pending culture results
   - follow up blood, urine, mycolytic cultures
   Diabetic Ketoacidosis:  Resolved with insulin drip and IVF.  Anion gap
   now 13.  Electrolytes stable.
   - continue home lantus with humalog sliding scale
   - replete electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   Hypertension: Blood presusres grossly elevated on presentation. Concern
   given new onset tachycardiac that this may be related to alcohol versus
   benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - hydralazine 10 mg IV Q6H for now
   - will restart home medications this morning (lisinopril, metoprolol,
   hydrochlorothiazide)
   - ativan for CIWA scale
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Unclear if
   her presentation now is consistent with DKA.
   - holding oral agents
   -  continue home insulin regimen of lantus and humalog sliding scale
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for septic right knee on fluconazole. She presented with one day of confusion, altered mental status, and unclear etiology. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 192/80 mmHg, and SpO2 of 95%. Her respiratory support is stable, with an ABG reading of 7.15. 

The patient's physical examination reveals an alert but agitated patient who does not respond to questions appropriately. She has multiple excorations on her skin, and her right knee has an area of fluctuance, erythema, without warmth. 

Laboratory results show normal WBC count, Hct, and Plt, with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiogram. Her glucose levels are stable, and her electrolytes are normal. 

The patient has a fungal knee infection, and she is being treated with fluconazole. She also has a history of septic right knee and is being treated for empiric coverage of meningitis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Meningitis: The patient has a history of septic right knee and is being treated for empiric coverage of meningitis. If the infection is not properly treated, it can lead to meningitis, which can be life-threatening.

2. Fungal infection: The patient has a fungal knee infection, and if it is not properly treated, it can spread to other parts of the body and cause serious complications.

3. Septic shock: The patient has a history of septic right knee, and if the infection is not properly treated, it can lead to septic shock, which can be life-threatening.

4. Diabetes ketoacidosis: The patient has a history of type II diabetes, and if her blood sugar levels are not properly controlled, it can lead to diabetes ketoacidosis, which can be life-threatening.

5. Hypertension: The patient has grossly elevated blood pressures, and if it is not properly controlled, it can lead to serious complications such as heart failure, stroke, and kidney damage.

6. Infection: The patient has a history of septic right knee and is being treated for empiric coverage of meningitis. If the infection is not properly treated, it can lead to serious complications such as sepsis, which can be life-threatening.

7. Neurologic complications: The patient has altered mental status, and if it is not properly treated, it can lead to serious complications such as brain damage, which can be life-threatening.

8. Cardiac complications: The patient has mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiogram, and if it is not properly treated, it can lead to serious complications such as heart failure, which can be life-threatening.

9. Renal complications: The patient has normal electrolytes, but if her kidney function is not properly monitored, it can lead to serious complications such as acute kidney injury, which can be life-threatening.

10. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of septic right knee and is being treated for empiric coverage of meningitis. If the infection is not properly treated, it can lead to serious complications such as sepsis, which can be life-threatening."

   diabetes on insulin, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and
   recent admission for septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**]
   parapsilosis who presents from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal, although she does not have a
   history of delirium tremens.  Other potential etiologies include
   primary neurologic disorders related to the findings on head CT
   (multiple areas of hypodensities) versus infection.  Many systemic
   causes now ruled out including liver, lung, renal disorders, thyroid,
   electrolyte abnormalities.  Diabetic ketoacidosis has now resolved.
   All cultures negative to date including CSF and mycolytic cultures.
   HSV PCR pending from CSF.   Echocardiogram negative for vegetation.
   - LP without clear signs of infection, culture pending, HSV PCR pending
   - Thiamine, folate, multivitamin
   - Ativan 2-4 mg IV Q2H:PRN CIWA > 10 for alcohol withdrawal
   - MRI/MRA of brain pending
   - EEG performed yesterday, no results yet
   - Neurologic consult
   - Vancomycin, gentamycin, acyclovir, fluconazole for empiric coverage
   of meningitis pending culture results
   - follow up blood, urine, mycolytic cultures
   Diabetic Ketoacidosis:  Resolved with insulin drip and IVF.  Anion gap
   now 13.  Electrolytes stable.
   - continue home lantus with humalog sliding scale
   - replete electrolytes
   Hypertension: Blood presusres grossly elevated on presentation. Concern
   given new onset tachycardiac that this may be related to alcohol versus
   benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - hydralazine 10 mg IV Q6H for now
   - will restart home medications this morning (lisinopril, metoprolol,
   hydrochlorothiazide)
   - ativan for CIWA scale
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Unclear if
   her presentation now is consistent with DKA.
   - holding oral agents
   -  continue home insulin regimen of lantus and humalog sliding scale
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and a recent admission for a septic right knee infection. She presented from home with one day of confusion, altered mental status, and multiple areas of hypodensities on her head CT scan.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Altered mental status: unclear etiology, but likely related to alcohol withdrawal, primary neurologic disorders, or infection
* Fungal knee infection: cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**], and she is being treated with fluconazole
* Diabetic ketoacidosis: resolved with insulin drip and IV fluids
* Hypertension: blood pressures are grossly elevated, and there is concern that this may be related to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal
* Fungal meningitis: cultures are pending, and she is being treated with vancomycin, gentamycin, and acyclovir pending culture results
* Neurologic disorders: multiple areas of hypodensities on head CT scan, and EEG is pending

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of altered mental status: if the patient's infection or primary neurologic disorder is not adequately treated, it may lead to further decline in her mental status.
2. Development of sepsis: the patient's fungal knee infection and fungal meningitis may progress to sepsis, which could be life-threatening.
3. Increased risk of bleeding: the patient's elevated blood pressures and use of anticoagulant medications (heparin) may increase her risk of bleeding.
4. Complications related to diabetes: the patient's diabetes may lead to complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, or neuropathy if not adequately managed.
5. Cardiovascular complications: the patient's hypertension and potential underlying cardiovascular disease may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or stroke.

Based on this information, it is recommended that the patient receive close monitoring and treatment for her underlying infections and medical conditions. She should also be closely monitored for any signs of worsening mental status, sepsis, bleeding, or cardiovascular complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a [**Female First Name (un) 444**] who has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a complex medical condition. The patient's chief complaint is altered mental status, and the note documents multiple medical events over the past 24 hours.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hypertension, and alcohol withdrawal. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 192/80 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals a healthy-appearing individual with sclera anicteric, dry mucous membranes, and clear oropharynx. The patient's lung fields are clear to auscultation, and the cardiovascular examination is normal. The patient's abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended, with present bowel sounds.

The patient has a history of right knee surgery with staples and an area of fluctuance, erythema, and without warmth. The patient's Foley catheter is draining clear yellow urine.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of DKA, with a blood glucose level of 233 mg/dL, and a potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L. The patient's white blood cell count is 13.1 K/uL, and the platelet count is 362.

The patient's medical plan includes the continuation of fluconazole, and the patient is to receive a knee tap. The patient is also to receive a sub-Q insulin and has been transitioned from IV insulin to sub-Q insulin after the gap closed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. DKA: The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, and the patient is at risk for developing more severe DKA if not properly managed.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and the patient is at risk for developing hypertensive crisis if not properly managed.
3. Seizures: The patient's altered mental status and history of alcohol withdrawal increase the risk of seizures.
4. Infection: The patient's history of knee surgery and presence of erythema and fluctuance on the right knee suggest a potential infection.
5. Endocarditis: The patient's history of native knee infection and empiric endocarditis coverage suggest a potential risk of endocarditis.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of hypertension and potential endocarditis increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of altered mental status and potential infection increase the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure.

In summary, the patient is a complex medical case with multiple medical conditions, including DKA, hypertension, and alcohol withdrawal. The patient is at risk for developing various medical complications, and close monitoring and proper management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   includes primary neurologic disorders versus systemic etiologies
   including liver, kidney, pulmonary disease versus medication/toxin
   induced.  Given history of significant alcohol and benzodiazepine use,
   withdrawal is also concerning (valium prescription recently ran out and
   last drink was approximately 24 hours ago).  Initial read of CT scan
   concerning for multiple brain lesions which raises the concern for CNS
   infection either primary or embolic.  In patient with recent candidal
   septic joint, disseminted candidal infection is possible although this
   would be extremely unusual in an immunocompetent host.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for septic right knee infection. She presented to the hospital with one day of confusion and was found to have altered mental status, likely due to a combination of factors including primary neurologic disorders, systemic etiologies, medication-induced effects, and possible withdrawal from benzodiazepines. The patient's condition is complicated by the presence of multiple brain lesions on CT scan, which raises concerns for CNS infection, either primary or embolic. She has also been diagnosed with a fungal knee infection and is being treated with fluconazole.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Meningitis: The patient's altered mental status and multiple brain lesions on CT scan suggest the possibility of meningitis, either primary or secondary to a CNS infection.
2. Fungal dissemination: Given the patient's recent candidal septic joint infection, there is a risk of disseminated candidal infection, although this is unusual in an immunocompetent host.
3. Withdrawal syndrome: The patient's history of benzodiazepine use and recent withdrawal from Valium prescription may lead to withdrawal syndrome.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is grossly elevated, and the concern is that this may be related to withdrawal or other underlying conditions.
5. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's positive urine ketones and elevated anion gap suggest the possibility of DKA, although this is unusual in patients with type II diabetes.
6. Infection: The patient's fungal knee infection and altered mental status raise concerns for other infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and multiple brain lesions on CT scan suggest the possibility of neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires further evaluation and management to address her altered mental status, fungal knee infection, and potential underlying conditions. The plan includes:

1. Neurological consult to evaluate the patient's altered mental status and rule out primary neurologic disorders.
2. Infectious disease consult to evaluate the patient's fungal knee infection and potential for disseminated candidal infection.
3. ID consult to evaluate the patient's altered mental status and potential underlying infections.
4. Echocardiogram to assess for vegetation.
5. Fungal blood cultures and HSV PCR from spinal fluid.
6. CSF cultures for bacteria, fungus, and viral pathogens.
7. Insulin drip with normal saline until finger stick < 200, then switch to D51/2 NS for hydration.
8. Hydralazine 10 mg IV Q6H for hypertension.
9. Ativan for CIWA scale.
10. Repeat VBG and obtain second read of head CT.
11. Consider EEG if no improvement.
12. ID consult in AM to discuss further management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female admitted with altered mental status, likely due to DKA and/or EtOH withdrawal, in the setting of recent fungal septic arthritis. She has been treated with vancomycin, gentamicin, and acyclovir for empiric CNS coverage. The patient's knee staples were removed yesterday, and she is awaiting an MRI/A brain. Her current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, and blood pressure of 166/78 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes oxygen therapy, and her SpO2 is 94%. She has a history of fungal septic arthritis, which is being treated with fluconazole for 6 weeks. The patient is also being treated for DKA, EtOH withdrawal, and hypertension.

Potential medical complications:

1. CNS infection: The patient's altered mental status could be due to a CNS infection, which needs to be ruled out. A pending EEG and MRI/A brain may help identify the cause of her altered mental status.
2. DKA and EtOH withdrawal: The patient is being treated for DKA and EtOH withdrawal, but these conditions can be challenging to manage and may lead to complications such as seizures, coma, or even death if not properly managed.
3. Fungal septic arthritis: The patient's fungal septic arthritis may lead to complications such as sepsis, organ failure, or amputation if not properly managed.
4. Endocarditis: The patient's septic knee may be related to endocarditis, which needs to be ruled out with a TTE.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may lead to complications such as heart failure, stroke, or kidney damage if not properly managed.
6. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to her underlying medical conditions, making her more susceptible to infections.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's tube feeds may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as aspiration, nausea, or vomiting.
8. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support may lead to complications such as respiratory failure, pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome.

These potential medical complications highlight the importance of close monitoring and proper management of the patient's underlying medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal, although she does not have a
   history of delirium tremens.  Other potential etiologies include
   primary neurologic disorders related to the findings on head CT
   (multiple areas of hypodensities) versus infection.  Many systemic
   causes now ruled out including liver, lung, renal disorders, thyroid,
   electrolyte abnormalities.  Diabetic ketoacidosis has now resolved.
   All cultures negative to date including CSF and mycolytic cultures.
   HSV PCR pending from CSF.  Echocardiogram negative for vegetation.
   - LP without clear signs of infection, culture pending, HSV PCR pending
   - Thiamine, folate, multivitamin
   - Ativan 2-4 mg IV Q2H:PRN CIWA > 10 for alcohol withdrawal
   - Awaiting MRI/MRA brain
   - EEG performed yesterday, no results yet

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and a recent admission for septic right knee. She presents from home with one day of confusion. She has altered mental status with unclear etiology, likely related to alcohol withdrawal, primary neurologic disorders, or infection. She has been treated with antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals for empiric coverage of meningitis. Her laboratory results show elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, and anion gap. She has been diagnosed with PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome) and is being treated with anticonvulsants and blood pressure control.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure: The patient has been diagnosed with PRES and is at risk for seizure. Close monitoring of her neurological status and anticonvulsant therapy are necessary.
2. Infection: The patient has been treated with antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals for empiric coverage of meningitis. However, the etiology of her altered mental status is still unclear, and she may still be at risk for infection.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is grossly elevated, and she is at risk for hypertensive emergency.
4. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes is not well-controlled, and she is at risk for recurrent DKA.
5. Fungal Knee Infection: The patient has a fungal knee infection and is being treated with antifungals. Close monitoring of her wound and follow-up with infectious disease service are necessary.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient has PRES, and she is at risk for further neurological complications, such as stroke, cerebral edema, or herniation.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she is at risk for respiratory failure due to her altered mental status and potential respiratory muscle weakness.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and she is at risk for hypertensive emergency, cardiac arrhythmias, or cardiac failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue anticonvulsant therapy and monitor the patient's neurological status closely.
2. Continue empiric antibiotic therapy for meningitis until the etiology of the patient's altered mental status is clear.
3. Monitor the patient's blood pressure closely and adjust antihypertensive therapy as necessary.
4. Continue antifungal therapy for the fungal knee infection and monitor the patient's wound closely.
5. Monitor the patient's glucose levels closely and adjust insulin therapy as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust respiratory therapy as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely and adjust antihypertensive therapy as necessary.
8. Consider repeating MRI/MRA brain to rule out other potential causes of the patient's altered mental status."

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal, although she does not have a
   history of delirium tremens.  Other potential etiologies include
   primary neurologic disorders related to the findings on head CT
   (multiple areas of hypodensities) versus infection.  Many systemic
   causes now ruled out including liver, lung, renal disorders, thyroid,
   electrolyte abnormalities.  Diabetic ketoacidosis has now resolved.
   All cultures negative to date including CSF and mycolytic cultures.
   HSV PCR pending from CSF.  Echocardiogram negative for vegetation.
   - LP without clear signs of infection, culture pending, HSV PCR pending
   - Thiamine, folate, multivitamin
   - Ativan 2-4 mg IV Q2H:PRN CIWA > 10 for alcohol withdrawal
   - Awaiting MRI/MRA brain
   - EEG performed yesterday, no results yet
   - F/u Neurologic recs
   - Vancomycin, gentamycin, acyclovir, fluconazole for empiric coverage
   of meningitis pending negative culture results x 48 h
   - follow up blood, urine, mycolytic cultures
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 13.  Electrolytes stable.
   - holding oral agents
   -  continue home insulin regimen of lantus and humalog sliding scale;
   titrate prn
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn
   Hypertension: Blood presusres grossly elevated on presentation. Concern
   given new onset tachycardiac that this may be related to alcohol versus
   benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - hydralazine 10 mg IV Q6H djscontinued
   - restarted home meds today (lisinopril, metoprolol,
   hydrochlorothiazide)
   - ativan for CIWA scale
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.
   - continue fluconazole; clarify course
   - orthopedics removed staples yesterday, evaluated wound and felt
   healing well
   - clarify plan to tap with ortho and ID

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for septic right knee on fluconazole for Candida parapsilosis. She presents from home with one day of confusion.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Altered mental status: unclear etiology, likely source is alcohol withdrawal, but also potential etiologies include primary neurologic disorders related to head CT findings or infection.
* Blood cultures: all negative to date, including CSF and mycolytic cultures.
* Echocardiogram: negative for vegetation.
* Head CT: shows multiple areas of hypodensities.
* Lab results: WBC 13.1, Hct 33.6, Plt 362, Cr 1.0, Glucose 194, Ca++ 9.0 mg/dL, Mg++ 1.5 mg/dL, PO4 2.3 mg/dL.
* Medications: Ativan 2-4 mg IV Q2H for alcohol withdrawal, Vancomycin, Gentamycin, Acyclovir, Fluconazole for empiric coverage of meningitis.
* Plan: awaiting MRI/MRA brain, EEG performed yesterday, no results yet, follow-up Neurologic recs, continue empiric antibiotics for 48 hours, follow up blood, urine, mycolytic cultures.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Seizures: due to the patient's altered mental status and potential neurologic disorders.
2. Infection: despite negative blood cultures, the patient is at risk for developing a secondary infection, particularly given her immunocompromised state.
3. Neurologic deterioration: the patient's mental status may continue to decline if the underlying cause is not addressed.
4. Cardiac complications: the patient's hypertension and tachycardia may lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
5. Renal complications: the patient's elevated creatinine levels may indicate kidney damage, which could worsen if not addressed.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: the patient's altered mental status and potential neurologic disorders may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or constipation.
7. Respiratory complications: the patient's altered mental status may lead to respiratory complications, such as respiratory depression or aspiration.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications from arising."

   Imaging:
   MRI Head [**2190-7-7**]: Limited study secondary to motion.  T2 and FLAIR axial
   images obtained.  Sag T1 extremely degraded.  There is diffuse white
   matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensity involving the bilateral
   parietal/occipital lobes as well as frontal lobes.  Temporal lobes,
   cerebellum and [**Doctor Last Name 988**] matter including the basal ganglia are relatively
   spared.  Finding is non-specific, with broad differential including
   PRES (esp given additional clinical history of hypertension on admit
   with systolics > 220), toxic/metabolic, seizure, and infections
   etiologies.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal, although she does not have a
   history of delirium tremens.  Other potential etiologies include
   primary neurologic disorders related to the findings on head CT
   (multiple areas of hypodensities) versus infection.  MRI yesterday was
   extremely limited study but showed diffuse T2 hyperintensities with
   broad differential including infection, PRES, seizure, toxins.  All
   cultures negative to date including CSF and mycolytic cultures.  HSV
   PCR pending from CSF.  Transthoracic echocardiogram negative for
   vegetation.  Plan to intubate patient this AM to obtain repeat MRI and
   TEE.
   - LP without clear signs of infection, culture pending, HSV PCR pending
   - Thiamine, folate, multivitamin
   - Ativan 2-4 mg IV Q2H:PRN CIWA > 10 for alcohol withdrawal
   - EEG performed [**7-5**], no results yet
   - f/u Neurologic recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - Vancomycin, gentamycin, acyclovir, fluconazole for empiric coverage
   of meningitis pending MRI and HSV PCR
   - follow up blood, urine, mycolytic cultures
   - TTE  negative, plan for TEE today
   - repeat MRI today
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 12.  Electrolytes stable.  Blood sugars elevated this morning after
   receiving only half dose lantus.
   - holding oral agents
   - will give remainder of home dose lantus this morning.  Will need
   increased doses of lantus this evening after tube feeds are restarted
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn
   Hypertension: Blood presusres grossly elevated on presentation. Concern
   given new onset tachycardiac that this may be related to alcohol versus
   benzodiazepine withdrawal. No improvement in blood pressures despite
   home antihypertensive regimen yesterday.  Given differential diagnosis
   of findings on head CT/MRI goal is for autoregulation but to keep
   pressures below 200.
   - hydralazine 5-10 mg IV Q4H:PRN for SBP > 200
   - continue home meds lisinopril, metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide
   - ativan for CIWA scale
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.
   - continue fluconazole; clarify course
   - orthopedics removed staples feel wound healing well
   - deferring tap for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn
   Hypertension: Blood presusres grossly elevated on presentation. Concern
   given new onset tachycardiac that this may be related to alcohol versus
   benzodiazepine withdrawal. No improvement in blood pressures despite
   home antihypertensive regimen yesterday.  Given differential diagnosis
   of findings on head CT/MRI goal is for autoregulation but to keep

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient, a 47-year-old female, was admitted with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and a recent admission for a septic right knee infection. She presented from home with one day of confusion. The patient's mental status is altered, with unclear etiology, and most likely related to alcohol withdrawal. However, other potential etiologies include primary neurologic disorders related to the findings on head CT and MRI.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 13.1, 9.1, 9.4
* Hct: 33.6, 33.9, 32.6
* Plt: 362, 308, 288
* Cr: 1.0, 1.1, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0
* Glucose: 194, 104, 232, 164, 233, 275, 271
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 12.9/22.5/1.1, Lactic Acid: 0.9 mmol/L, Ca++: 9.0 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.5 mg/dL, PO4: 2.3 mg/dL

Imaging studies show:

* MRI Head: Limited study secondary to motion, showing diffuse white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensity involving the bilateral parietal/occipital lobes as well as frontal lobes.

The patient's plan includes:

* Intubation to obtain repeat MRI and TEE
* LP without clear signs of infection, culture pending, HSV PCR pending
* Thiamine, folate, multivitamin
* Ativan 2-4 mg IV Q2H:PRN CIWA > 10 for alcohol withdrawal
* EEG performed [**7-5**], no results yet
* Follow-up Neurologic and ID recs
* Vancomycin, gentamycin, acyclovir, fluconazole for empiric coverage of meningitis pending MRI and HSV PCR
* Follow-up blood, urine, mycolytic cultures
* TTE negative, plan for TEE today
* Repeat MRI today

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Increased intracranial pressure due to PRES or infection
* Seizure activity due to PRES or infection
* Worsening of mental status due to alcohol withdrawal or infection
* Development of meningitis or encephalitis
* Progression of septic right knee infection
* Hypertensive crisis due to uncontrolled blood pressure
* Diabetic ketoacidosis due to uncontrolled diabetes
* Fungal sepsis due to fluconazole-resistant infection

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent these potential complications."

   Imaging:
   MRI Head [**2190-7-7**]: Limited study secondary to motion.  T2 and FLAIR axial
   images obtained.  Sag T1 extremely degraded.  There is diffuse white
   matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensity involving the bilateral
   parietal/occipital lobes as well as frontal lobes.  Temporal lobes,
   cerebellum and [**Doctor Last Name 988**] matter including the basal ganglia are relatively
   spared.  Finding is non-specific, with broad differential including
   PRES (esp given additional clinical history of hypertension on admit
   with systolics > 220), toxic/metabolic, seizure, and infections
   etiologies.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal, although she does not have a
   history of delirium tremens.  Other potential etiologies include
   primary neurologic disorders related to the findings on head CT
   (multiple areas of hypodensities) versus infection.  MRI yesterday was
   extremely limited study but showed diffuse T2 hyperintensities with
   broad differential including infection, PRES, seizure, toxins.  All
   cultures negative to date including CSF and mycolytic cultures.  HSV
   PCR pending from CSF.  Transthoracic echocardiogram negative for
   vegetation.  Plan to intubate patient this AM to obtain repeat MRI and
   TEE.
   - LP without clear signs of infection, culture pending, HSV PCR pending
   - Thiamine, folate, multivitamin
   - Ativan 2-4 mg IV Q2H:PRN CIWA > 10 for alcohol withdrawal
   - EEG performed [**7-5**], no results yet
   - f/u Neurologic recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - Vancomycin, gentamycin, acyclovir, fluconazole for empiric coverage
   of meningitis pending MRI and HSV PCR
   - follow up blood, urine, mycolytic cultures
   - TTE  negative, plan for TEE today
   - repeat MRI today
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 12.  Electrolytes stable.  Blood sugars elevated this morning after
   receiving only half dose lantus.
   - holding oral agents
   - will give remainder of home dose lantus this morning.  Will need
   increased doses of lantus this evening after tube feeds are restarted
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn
   Hypertension: Blood presusres grossly elevated on presentation. Concern
   given new onset tachycardiac that this may be related to alcohol versus
   benzodiazepine withdrawal. No improvement in blood pressures despite
   home antihypertensive regimen yesterday.  Given differential diagnosis
   of findings on head CT/MRI goal is for autoregulation but to keep
   pressures below 200.
   - hydralazine 5-10 mg IV Q4H:PRN for SBP > 200
   - continue home meds lisinopril, metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide
   - ativan for CIWA scale
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.
   - continue fluconazole; clarify course
   - orthopedics removed staples feel wound healing well
   - deferring tap for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensity involving the bilateral
   parietal/occipital lobes as well as frontal lobes.  Temporal lobes,
   cerebellum and [**Doctor Last Name 988**] matter including the basal ganglia are relatively
   spared.  Finding is non-specific, with broad differential including
   PRES (esp given additional clinical history of hypertension on admit
   with systolics > 220), toxic/metabolic, seizure, and infections
   etiologies.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal, although she does not have a
   history of delirium tremens.  Other potential etiologies include
   primary neurologic disorders related to the findings on head CT
   (multiple areas of hypodensities) versus infection.  MRI yesterday was
   extremely limited study but showed diffuse T2 hyperintensities with
   broad differential including infection, PRES, seizure, toxins.  All
   cultures negative to date including CSF and mycolytic cultures.  HSV
   PCR pending from CSF.  Transthoracic echocardiogram negative for
   vegetation.  Plan to intubate patient this AM to obtain repeat MRI and
   TEE.
   - LP without clear signs of infection, culture pending, HSV PCR pending
   - Thiamine, folate, multivitamin
   - Ativan 2-4 mg IV Q2H:PRN CIWA > 10 for alcohol withdrawal
   - EEG performed [**7-5**], no results yet
   - f/u Neurologic recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - Vancomycin, gentamycin, acyclovir, fluconazole for empiric coverage
   of meningitis pending MRI and HSV PCR
   - follow up blood, urine, mycolytic cultures
   - TTE  negative, plan for TEE today
   - repeat MRI today
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 12.  Electrolytes stable.  Blood sugars elevated this morning after
   receiving only half dose lantus.
   - holding oral agents
   - will give remainder of home dose lantus this morning.  Will need
   increased doses of lantus this evening after tube feeds are restarted
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn
   Hypertension: Blood presusres grossly elevated on presentation. Concern
   given new onset tachycardiac that this may be related to alcohol versus
   benzodiazepine withdrawal. No improvement in blood pressures despite
   home antihypertensive regimen yesterday.  Given differential diagnosis
   of findings on head CT/MRI goal is for autoregulation but to keep
   pressures below 200.
   - hydralazine 5-10 mg IV Q4H:PRN for SBP > 200
   - continue home meds lisinopril, metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide
   - ativan for CIWA scale
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.
   - continue fluconazole; clarify course
   - orthopedics removed staples feel wound healing well

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 47-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and a recent admission for septic right knee on fluconazole for parapsilosis. She presented from home with one day of confusion. Her mental status is altered, and the etiology is unclear. She has been treated with antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals, but all cultures have been negative to date. She has undergone imaging studies, including a head CT and MRI, which showed diffuse T2 hyperintensities with a broad differential diagnosis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.8°C (100.1°F)
* Heart rate: 81 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 181/145 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Slurred speech
* No acute distress
* No clear signs of infection
* Diffuse white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensity on MRI

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 13.1 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 362 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Blood glucose: 271 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Na 137 mEq/L, K 4.3 mEq/L, Cl 108 mEq/L, PO4 2.3 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of altered mental status
* Development of sepsis or meningitis
* Progression of kidney injury
* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia
* Hypertensive crisis
* Infection-related complications, such as abscesses or osteomyelitis

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Intubation and repeat MRI and TEE to investigate the cause of altered mental status
* Empiric coverage for meningitis with vancomycin, gentamycin, and acyclovir
* Monitoring of blood sugars and electrolytes
* Adjustments to antihypertensive medications as needed
* Continued treatment for fungal knee infection with fluconazole
* Deferral of tap for now

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensity involving the bilateral
   parietal/occipital lobes as well as frontal lobes.  Temporal lobes,
   cerebellum and [**Doctor Last Name 988**] matter including the basal ganglia are relatively
   spared.  Finding is non-specific, with broad differential including
   PRES (esp given additional clinical history of hypertension on admit
   with systolics > 220), toxic/metabolic, seizure, and infections
   etiologies.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal, although she does not have a
   history of delirium tremens.  Other potential etiologies include
   primary neurologic disorders related to the findings on head CT
   (multiple areas of hypodensities) versus infection.  MRI yesterday was
   extremely limited study but showed diffuse T2 hyperintensities with
   broad differential including PRES, infection, seizure, toxins.  All
   cultures negative to date including CSF and mycolytic cultures.  HSV
   PCR pending from CSF.  Transthoracic echocardiogram negative for
   vegetation.  Plan to intubate patient this AM to obtain repeat MRI and
   TEE.
   - LP without clear signs of infection, culture pending, HSV PCR pending
   - Thiamine, folate, multivitamin
   - Ativan 2-4 mg IV Q2H:PRN CIWA > 10 for alcohol withdrawal
   - EEG performed [**7-5**], no results yet
   - f/u Neurologic recs
   - f/u ID recs
   -d/c vancomycin, gentamycin today
   - cont acyclovir, fluconazole for empiric coverage of meningitis
   pending MRI and HSV PCR
   - follow up blood, urine, mycolytic cultures
   - TTE negative, plan for TEE today
   - repeat MRI today under sedation
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 12.  Electrolytes stable.  Blood sugars elevated this morning after
   receiving only half dose lantus.
   - holding oral agents
   - will give remainder of home dose lantus this morning.  Will need
   increased doses of lantus this evening after tube feeds are restarted
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn
   Hypertension: Blood presusres grossly elevated on presentation. Concern
   given new onset tachycardiac that this may be related to alcohol versus
   benzodiazepine withdrawal. No improvement in blood pressures despite
   home antihypertensive regimen yesterday.  Given differential diagnosis
   of findings on head CT/MRI goal is for autoregulation but to keep
   pressures below 200.
   - hydralazine 5-10 mg IV Q4H:PRN for SBP > 200
   - continue home meds lisinopril, metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide
   - ativan for CIWA scale
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.
   - continue fluconazole; clarify course
   - will be getting TEE; will need ophtho consult and HIV testing as well
   - orthopedics removed staples feel wound healing well
   - deferring tap for now

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and a recent admission for a septic right knee infection on fluconazole. The patient presents from home with one day of confusion.

The patient's current condition is:

* Altered mental status with unclear etiology, possibly related to alcohol withdrawal, primary neurologic disorders, or infection.
* Diffuse T2 hyperintensities on MRI, with a broad differential including PRES, infection, seizure, and toxins.
* All cultures, including CSF and mycolytic cultures, are negative to date.
* HSV PCR is pending from CSF.
* Transthoracic echocardiogram is negative for vegetation.
* The patient is being treated with ativan for CIWA scale and is planned to be intubated for repeat MRI and TEE.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:

* Seizures or status epilepticus due to the diffuse T2 hyperintensities on MRI.
* Infection, including meningitis, which may be caused by the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of a septic knee infection.
* Hypertensive crisis due to the patient's history of hypertension and the use of hydralazine to control blood pressure.
* Diabetes ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (HHNS) due to the patient's type II diabetes and the use of insulin.
* Fungal infection of the knee, which may be resistant to fluconazole and require further treatment.
* HIV infection, which may be acquired through the patient's previous sexual activities.

The patient's medications include:

* Ativan for CIWA scale
* Acyclovir for empiric coverage of meningitis
* Fluconazole for empiric coverage of fungal infection
* Vancomycin and gentamycin for empiric coverage of bacterial infection
* Lantus for diabetes management
* Metoprolol and lisinopril for hypertension management
* Hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension management

The patient's laboratory results include:

* WBC count: 13.1-9.4 K/uL
* Hct: 33.6-32.6%
* Plt: 362-288 K/uL
* Cr: 1.0-1.0 mg/dL
* Glucose: 194-271 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 12.9/22.5/1.1, Lactic Acid: 0.9 mmol/L, Ca++: 9.0 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.5 mg/dL, PO4: 2.3 mg/dL

The patient's imaging results include:

* MRI Head: Limited study due to motion, showing diffuse T2/FLAIR hyperintensity involving the bilateral parietal/occipital lobes as well as frontal lobes.
* TTE: Negative for vegetation.
* CSF cultures: Negative to date.
* HSV PCR: Pending from CSF.

The patient's plan includes:

* Intubation for repeat MRI and TEE.
* Holding tube feeds for now.
* Continuing fluconazole for empiric coverage of fungal infection.
* Continuing acyclovir for empiric coverage of meningitis.
* Deferring tap for now.
* Following up with infectious disease service.
* Obtaining ophtho consult and HIV testing.
* Continuing home medications for hypertension and diabetes management."

   47 yo female admitted with altered mental status in the setting of
   recent fungal septic arthritis, with likely DKA +/- EtOH withdrawal.
   Altered mental status- ruling out CNS infection, covering broadly at
   the moment. Treating for DKA and EtOH withdrawal. MRI yest w/ diffuse
   changes but suboptimal imaging
   -plan on elective intubation today for repeat MRI/A to better assess
   -final EEG read still pending
   -DKA and EtOH mgmt as below
   -on vanco + gent + acyclovir for empiric CNS coverage; plan on dc vanco
   and gentamicin today given negative culture data
   Fungal septic arthritis- on fluconazole x 6wks total (currently apporx
   3 wks in)
   -has fluctuant area on R lateral aspect of knee which we are following
   clinically at this point, slightly improved today
   -Ortho and ID following; will need them to discuss re: aspiration of
   fluid collection
   -will need eventual Ophthal eval if hasnt had one.
   -will also need TEE to better assess for vegetations given Candidal
   knee infxn
   -will need HIV at some point
   EtOH withdrawal- CIWA protocol w/ prn benzodiazepine
   DKA- gap closed, stable control on home regimen + RISS. still holding
   glyburide
   HTN: Rx with beta blocker, HCTZ and lisinopril, prn hydralazine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, likely due to recent fungal septic arthritis, DKA, and/or EtOH withdrawal. The patient's condition has been stabilized, with closed gap and controlled blood sugar levels.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, and blood pressure of 170/72 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, with normal cardiovascular and respiratory examination. The patient's abdominal examination is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. The patient's extremities are absent, with lateral fluctuance and decreased overlying erythema on the right knee.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.1, hemoglobin of 11.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 362. The patient's creatinine level is 1.0 mg/dL, and glucose level is 271 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a sodium level of 137 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L, and chloride level of 108 mEq/L.

The patient's imaging studies, including an MRI of the brain, show diffuse white matter changes but are of poor quality. The patient's microbiology results show no growth on all cultures reviewed.

The patient's plan of care includes elective intubation for repeat MRI/A to better assess the patient's condition. The patient will also undergo EEG, TEE, and ophthalmological evaluation. The patient's fungal septic arthritis will be managed with fluconazole for six weeks, and the patient's DKA and EtOH withdrawal will be managed with insulin and benzodiazepines as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. CNS infection: The patient's altered mental status and diffuse white matter changes on MRI suggest the possibility of a CNS infection, which could worsen if not treated promptly.
2. DKA: The patient's DKA is being managed with insulin and fluids, but there is a risk of worsening hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis if the patient's treatment plan is not adjusted accordingly.
3. EtOH withdrawal: The patient's EtOH withdrawal is being managed with benzodiazepines, but there is a risk of worsening withdrawal symptoms if the patient's treatment plan is not adjusted accordingly.
4. Fungal septic arthritis: The patient's fungal septic arthritis could worsen if not treated promptly and effectively with antifungal medications.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, which is above normal, and the patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the patient's respiratory status is not monitored closely.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia could worsen if not managed effectively with antihypertensive medications and rate control measures.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   47 yo female admitted with altered mental status in the setting of
   recent fungal septic arthritis, with likely DKA +/- EtOH withdrawal.
   Altered mental status- ruling out CNS infection, covering broadly at
   the moment. Treating for DKA and EtOH withdrawal. MRI yest w/ diffuse
   changes but suboptimal imaging
   -plan on elective intubation today for repeat MRI/A to better assess
   -final EEG read still pending
   -DKA and EtOH mgmt as below
   -on vanco + gent + acyclovir for empiric CNS coverage; plan on dc vanco
   and gentamicin today given negative culture data if repeat MRI/A is not
   worrisome for features of infection
   Fungal septic arthritis- on fluconazole x 6wks total (currently apporx
   3 wks in)
   -has fluctuant area on R lateral aspect of knee which we are following
   clinically at this point, slightly improved today
   -Ortho and ID following; will need them to discuss re: aspiration of
   fluid collection
   -will need eventual Ophthal eval if hasnt had one.
   -will also need TEE to better assess for vegetations given Candidal
   knee infxn
   -will need HIV at some point
   EtOH withdrawal- CIWA protocol w/ prn benzodiazepine
   DKA- gap closed, stable control on home regimen + RISS. still holding

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, suspected to be related to recent fungal septic arthritis, DKA, and possible EtOH withdrawal. She has a history of fungal septic arthritis and is currently receiving treatment with fluconazole. The patient has been experiencing fluctuating symptoms, including mental status changes, and has been receiving treatment for DKA and EtOH withdrawal. She has also been experiencing respiratory and cardiovascular instability.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. CNS Infection: The patient's altered mental status and poor-quality MRI findings suggest the possibility of a CNS infection. Empiric coverage with vancomycin, gentamicin, and acyclovir has been initiated, but further evaluation is needed to rule out a CNS infection.
2. DKA: The patient's DKA has been managed with insulin and fluid therapy, but the patient remains at risk for recurrence. Close monitoring of glucose levels and adjustments to the insulin regimen are necessary.
3. EtOH Withdrawal: The patient's CIWA protocol is in place to manage her EtOH withdrawal symptoms. Close monitoring of her symptoms and adjustments to the benzodiazepine regimen are necessary.
4. Fungal Septic Arthritis: The patient's fungal septic arthritis has been treated with fluconazole, but the patient remains at risk for recurrence. Close monitoring of her symptoms and further evaluation are necessary to ensure that the infection is fully treated.
5. Cardiovascular Instability: The patient's cardiovascular instability, including hypotension and tachycardia, may be related to her septic shock or other underlying conditions. Close monitoring of her vital signs and adjustments to her medication regimen are necessary.
6. Respiratory Instability: The patient's respiratory instability, including hypoxia and tachypnea, may be related to her septic shock or other underlying conditions. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and adjustments to her oxygen therapy are necessary.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and fluctuating symptoms may be related to her underlying conditions or other neurological complications. Close monitoring of her neurological status and further evaluation are necessary to rule out any underlying neurological conditions.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and adjust her medication regimen as necessary.
2. Continue to manage the patient's DKA and EtOH withdrawal symptoms with insulin and benzodiazepines, respectively.
3. Continue to treat the patient's fungal septic arthritis with fluconazole and monitor her symptoms for signs of recurrence.
4. Consider further evaluation of the patient's CNS infection with a repeat MRI or EEG.
5. Consider further evaluation of the patient's cardiovascular and respiratory instability with echocardiography and pulmonary function tests, respectively.
6. Consider further evaluation of the patient's neurological status with a neurological consultation and further imaging studies, as necessary."

   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal with a component of PRES. Other
   potential etiologies include primary neurologic disorders related to
   the findings on head CT (multiple areas of hypodensities) versus
   infection.  MRI [**2190-7-6**] extremely limited but showed diffuse T2
   hyperintensities with broad differential including PRES, infection,
   seizure, toxins.  All cultures negative to date including CSF and
   mycolytic cultures.  HSV PCR pending from CSF.  EEG without seizure
   activity.  Transthoracic echocardiogram negative for vegetation.  She
   was intubated [**2190-7-7**] and received TEE which was without vegitation.
   Repeat MRI also performed, results pending.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for septic right knee on fluconazole. She presents from home with one day of confusion.

The patient has been intubated and is receiving invasive ventilation. She has undergone a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) without evidence of vegetation. An MRI brain is pending, and HSV PCR is pending from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

The patient's condition is complicated by:

1. Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES): The patient's altered mental status is likely related to alcohol withdrawal with a component of PRES.
2. Septic Arthritis: The patient has a septic right knee infection, which is being treated with fluconazole.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient presented with DKA, which is now resolved with insulin drip and IV fluids.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is grossly elevated, and concerns exist regarding new-onset tachycardia, which may be related to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal.
5. Fungal Knee Infection: The patient has a fungal knee infection, which is being treated with fluconazole.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Seizures: Given the patient's history of altered mental status and PRES, seizures are a potential concern.
2. Meningitis: The patient's CSF cultures are pending, and HSV PCR is pending from CSF. If the results are positive, meningitis may be a concern.
3. Sepsis: The patient's septic right knee infection and septic arthritis may lead to sepsis.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and respiratory failure may occur if the patient's condition deteriorates.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia may lead to cardiovascular instability.
6. Infection: The patient's fungal knee infection and septic right knee infection may lead to further infections, such as pneumonia or UTI.
7. Neurological deterioration: The patient's PRES and altered mental status may lead to neurological deterioration if not properly managed.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued management of her septic right knee infection with fluconazole.
2. Monitoring of her blood pressure and tachycardia.
3. Management of her hypertension with hydralazine and home antihypertensive medications.
4. Continued management of her diabetes with insulin drip and IV fluids.
5. Monitoring of her respiratory status and consideration of extubation.
6. Continued monitoring of her neurological status and potential for seizures.
7. Further management of her PRES and potential for neurological deterioration.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU."

   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal with a component of PRES. Other
   potential etiologies include primary neurologic disorders related to
   the findings on head CT (multiple areas of hypodensities) versus
   infection.  MRI [**2190-7-7**] extremely limited but showed diffuse T2
   hyperintensities with broad differential including PRES, infection,
   seizure, toxins.  All cultures negative to date including CSF and
   mycolytic cultures.  HSV PCR pending from CSF.  Transthoracic
   echocardiogram negative for vegetation.  She was intubated [**2190-7-8**] and
   received TEE which was without vegitation.  Repeat MRI also performed,
   results pending.
   - LP without clear signs of infection, culture pending, HSV PCR pending
   - Thiamine, folate, multivitamin
   - Ativan 2-4 mg IV Q2H:PRN CIWA > 10 for alcohol withdrawal (requiring

   Hypertension: [**Month/Day (4) 229**] presusres grossly elevated on presentation. Concern
   given new onset tachycardiac that this may be related to alcohol versus
   benzodiazepine withdrawal. No improvement in [**Month/Day (4) **] pressures despite
   home antihypertensive regimen yesterday although per husband baseline
   [**Name2 (NI) **] pressures range from 150s to 180s.
   - hydralazine 5-10 mg IV Q4H:PRN for SBP > 200
   - continue home meds lisinopril, metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for septic right knee. She presents from home with one day of confusion and altered mental status.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. She has undergone a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) without evidence of vegetation. Her MRI brain is pending, and HSV PCR is pending from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

The patient has a complex medical history, including diabetes, hypertension, and septic right knee infection. She is currently receiving treatment for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), septic arthritis, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation, which may lead to respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or respiratory failure.
2. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may be related to alcohol withdrawal, PRES, or other primary neurologic disorders. Further neurological complications may include seizures, stroke, or increased intracranial pressure.
3. Infection: The patient has a septic right knee infection and is at risk for developing other infections, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs) or central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs).
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has hypertension, which may lead to cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.
5. Endocrine complications: The patient has diabetes and may experience endocrine complications such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is receiving parenteral nutrition, which may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting.
7. Hematological complications: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.

To prevent or manage these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored for any changes in her condition and receive appropriate treatment and interventions as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES). He is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation, and has a PICC line inserted for antibiotic administration. He has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and septic arthritis. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, and blood pressure of 180/72 mmHg. His respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he is at risk of developing respiratory failure due to his underlying condition and the need for invasive ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of septic arthritis, and is at risk of developing sepsis due to his PICC line and antibiotic administration.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has a history of diabetes, and is at risk of developing DKA due to his underlying condition and the need for insulin therapy.
4. Hypertensive Crisis: The patient has a history of hypertension, and is at risk of developing a hypertensive crisis due to his underlying condition and the need for antihypertensive therapy.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient has a history of PRES, and is at risk of developing neurological complications such as seizures, coma, or stroke.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to his underlying condition and the need for invasive lines and devices.
7. Bleeding: The patient is at risk of bleeding due to his underlying condition and the need for anticoagulant therapy.
8. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of hypertension, and is at risk of developing cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias.

Based on the patient's history and current condition, it is essential to monitor his vital signs closely, maintain his respiratory support, and manage his underlying conditions to prevent potential complications."

   HIP, ANKLE, ETC.)
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal, although she does not have a
   history of delirium tremens.  Other potential etiologies include
   primary neurologic disorders related to the findings on head CT
   (multiple areas of hypodensities) versus infection.  MRI yesterday was
   extremely limited study but showed diffuse T2 hyperintensities with
   broad differential including PRES, infection, seizure, toxins.  All
   cultures negative to date including CSF and mycolytic cultures.  HSV
   PCR pending from CSF.  Transthoracic echocardiogram negative for
   vegetation.  Plan to intubate patient this AM to obtain repeat MRI and
   TEE.
   - LP without clear signs of infection, culture pending, HSV PCR pending
   - Thiamine, folate, multivitamin
   - Ativan 2-4 mg IV Q2H:PRN CIWA > 10 for alcohol withdrawal
   - EEG performed [**7-5**], no results yet
   - f/u Neurologic recs
   - f/u ID recs
   -d/c vancomycin, gentamycin today
   - cont acyclovir, fluconazole for empiric coverage of meningitis
   pending MRI and HSV PCR
   - follow up blood, urine, mycolytic cultures
   - TTE negative, plan for TEE today
   - repeat MRI today under sedation
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 12.  Electrolytes stable.  Blood sugars elevated this morning after
   receiving only half dose lantus.
   - holding oral agents
   - will give remainder of home dose lantus this morning.  Will need
   increased doses of lantus this evening after tube feeds are restarted
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn
   Hypertension: Blood presusres grossly elevated on presentation. Concern
   given new onset tachycardiac that this may be related to alcohol versus
   benzodiazepine withdrawal. No improvement in blood pressures despite
   home antihypertensive regimen yesterday.  Given differential diagnosis
   of findings on head CT/MRI goal is for autoregulation but to keep
   pressures below 200.
   - hydralazine 5-10 mg IV Q4H:PRN for SBP > 200
   - continue home meds lisinopril, metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide
   - ativan for CIWA scale
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.
   - continue fluconazole; clarify course
   - will be getting TEE; will need ophtho consult and HIV testing as well
   - orthopedics removed staples feel wound healing well

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female admitted with altered mental status, recent fungal septic arthritis, and DKA +/- EtOH withdrawal. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She has been treated with antibiotics, antifungals, and other medications. Her current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, and blood pressure of 179/68 mmHg. She has a pending MRI brain, which suggests PRES.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. PRES (Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome): The patient's MRI brain suggests PRES, which is a condition characterized by reversible brain edema. This condition can lead to seizures, altered mental status, and even death if left untreated.
2. CNS Infection: The patient's altered mental status and pending MRI brain may indicate a CNS infection, which can be life-threatening if left untreated.
3. DKA (Diabetic Ketoacidosis): The patient has a history of DKA, which can lead to serious complications if not managed properly.
4. EtOH Withdrawal: The patient is experiencing EtOH withdrawal, which can lead to seizures, tremors, and other complications if not managed properly.
5. Fungal Septic Arthritis: The patient has a history of fungal septic arthritis, which can lead to serious complications if not treated properly.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which can lead to cardiovascular complications such as hypertensive emergency or cardiac failure.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which can lead to respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or respiratory failure.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and pending MRI brain may indicate neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, or brain hemorrhage.

Recommendations:

1. Repeat MRI brain to confirm the diagnosis of PRES and rule out other CNS conditions.
2. Treat the patient's DKA and EtOH withdrawal according to the hospital's protocol.
3. Continue antibiotics and antifungals as prescribed.
4. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and cardiovascular status closely to prevent cardiovascular complications.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely to prevent respiratory complications.
6. Consider EEG to rule out seizures or other neurological complications.
7. Consult with specialists such as neurology and infectious disease to optimize the patient's care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female admitted with altered mental status, recent fungal septic arthritis, and DKA/EtOH withdrawal. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The note highlights the following key points:

1. The patient's 24-hour events include intubation for procedures, placement of a PICC line, and a TEE that was negative for vegetations.
2. The patient's imaging studies, including a repeat MRI brain, suggest a PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome) picture.
3. The patient has a history of fungal septic arthritis, which is being treated with fluconazole. A fluctuant area on the right lateral aspect of the knee is being monitored clinically.
4. The patient is also being treated for DKA/EtOH withdrawal, with a gap closed and stable control on home regimen plus RISS. Glyburide is still being held.
5. The patient has hypertension, which is being treated with a beta blocker, HCTZ, and lisinopril, with prn hydralazine to titrate up for tighter control given the possibility of PRES.
6. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a Vt of 450 mL and a PS of 5 cmH2O.
7. The patient's laboratory results show a WBC count of 13.1, Hct of 31.1, and a platelet count of 295 K/uL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. CNS infection: Given the patient's altered mental status and recent fungal septic arthritis, there is a risk of CNS infection, which could be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi.
2. PRES: The patient's MRI brain suggests a PRES picture, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including hypertension, sepsis, and certain medications.
3. DKA/EtOH withdrawal: The patient is still experiencing DKA/EtOH withdrawal, which can lead to serious complications if not managed properly.
4. Fungal septic arthritis: The patient's fungal septic arthritis is being treated with fluconazole, but there is a risk of recurrence or spread of the infection if not properly managed.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is being treated, but there is a risk of complications if not properly controlled, such as PRES, cardiac problems, or kidney damage.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which can lead to respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, respiratory failure, or lung injury.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's altered mental status and recent illness may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, or gastrointestinal bleeding.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely and adjusting her treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these complications."

   Imaging:
   MRI Brain:
   Extensive white matter abnormalities involving the posterior
   distribution as well as extending to involve the frontal and parietal
   lobes in
   a watershed distribution. Given the conciliation of these findings,
   these are
   again most concerning for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.
   Again
   differential considerations include a toxic or metabolic process.
   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome
 ARTHRITIS, SEPTIC (JOINT INFECTION, SEPTIC JOINT, INCLUDING KNEE,
   HIP, ANKLE, ETC.)
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal with a component of PRES. Repeat
   MRI most consistent with PRES.  All cultures negative to date including
   CSF and mycolytic cultures and HSV PCR.  TTE and TEE without
   vegetation.  Mental status slowly improving.
   - d/c acyclovir as HSV PCR negative
   - cultures from admission negative to date
   - aggressively manage blood pressure with target pressures at her
   baseline of 150-160
   - will add labetolol for BP control today
   - will change to valium Q6H CIWA today in anticipation of floor
   transfer
   - consider call out to floor this evening if blood pressures stable
   Fevers:  Spiked a fever to 101 last night.  Most likely etiology is
   urinary tract infection as patient had foley catheter and positive UA.
   She has a history of ESBL so she was started on meropenem. Blood
   cultures and urine cultures pending.
   - meropenem day [**2-6**] for urinary tract infection pending cultures
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 13.  Electrolytes stable.  Lantus increased to 25 yesterday with
   increase in her sliding scale.
   - holding oral agents
   - continue lantus with regular insulin sliding scale
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn
   Hypertension: Blood pressures grossly elevated on presentation likely
   from alcohol withdrawal and essential hypertension.  Per her husband
   her baseline blood pressures range in the 150s-160s.
   - hydralazine 20 IV Q6H
   - will add labetolol 400 mg TID and will titrate up today
   - discontinue metoprolol
   - lisinopril 40 mg daily
   - continue hydrochlorothiazide
   - PO valium for CIWA scale
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.
   - continue fluconazole, plan for 6+ weeks of therapy to be readdressed
   by ID as outpatient
   - TEE negative; will need ophtho consult and HIV testing as well
   - orthopedics removed staples feel wound healing well
   - deferring tap for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal with a component of PRES. Repeat
   MRI most consistent with PRES.  All cultures negative to date including
   CSF and mycolytic cultures and HSV PCR.  TTE and TEE without
   vegetation.  Mental status slowly improving.
   - d/c acyclovir as HSV PCR negative
   - cultures from admission negative to date
   - aggressively manage blood pressure with target pressures at her
   baseline of 150-160
   - will add labetolol for BP control today
   - will change to valium Q6H CIWA today in anticipation of floor
   transfer
   - consider call out to floor this evening if blood pressures stable
   Fevers:  Spiked a fever to 101 last night.  Most likely etiology is
   urinary tract infection as patient had foley catheter and positive UA.
   She has a history of ESBL so she was started on meropenem. Blood
   cultures and urine cultures pending.
   - meropenem day [**2-6**] for urinary tract infection pending cultures
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 13.  Electrolytes stable.  Lantus increased to 25 yesterday with
   increase in her sliding scale.
   - holding oral agents
   - continue lantus with regular insulin sliding scale
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn
   Hypertension: Blood pressures grossly elevated on presentation likely
   from alcohol withdrawal and essential hypertension.  Per her husband
   her baseline blood pressures range in the 150s-160s.
   - hydralazine 20 IV Q6H
   - will add labetolol 400 mg TID and will titrate up today
   - discontinue metoprolol
   - lisinopril 40 mg daily
   - continue hydrochlorothiazide
   - PO valium for CIWA scale
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for septic right knee infection. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing altered mental status, fever, and hypertension.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): The patient's MRI brain scan shows extensive white matter abnormalities, which are consistent with PRES.
2. Septic arthritis: The patient has a septic right knee infection, which is being treated with fluconazole.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a UTI, which is being treated with meropenem.
4. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with hydralazine and labetalol.
5. Diabetes mellitus (DM), type II: The patient has type II diabetes and is insulin-dependent.

The patient's laboratory results show:

1. White blood cell count (WBC): 13.1 K/uL
2. Hemoglobin (Hb): 10.6 g/dL
3. Platelet count (Plt): 362 K/uL
4. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 18 mEq/L
5. Creatinine (Cr): 1.0 mg/dL
6. Glucose: 228 mg/dL
7. Electrolyte levels: Potassium (K+): 4.2 mEq/L, sodium (Na+): 139 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-): 108 mEq/L

The patient's medication list includes:

1. Insulin drip and IV fluids for diabetes management
2. Hydralazine for hypertension
3. Labetalol for hypertension
4. Fluconazole for fungal knee infection
5. Meropenem for UTI
6. Valium for CIWA scale
7. Lantus for diabetes management
8. Lisinopril for hypertension
9. Hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Worsening of PRES: The patient's altered mental status and hypertension may worsen their PRES, leading to further neurological damage.
2. Septic shock: The patient's septic arthritis and UTI may lead to septic shock, which can be life-threatening.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's diabetes and insulin drip may lead to hyperglycemia, which can cause further complications.
4. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's hypertension may lead to a hypertensive crisis, which can cause further damage to their kidneys and other organs.
5. Fungal sepsis: The patient's fungal knee infection may lead to fungal sepsis, which can be life-threatening.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, laboratory results, and medication regimen to prevent or manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal with a component of PRES. Other
   potential etiologies include primary neurologic disorders related to
   the findings on head CT (multiple areas of hypodensities) versus
   infection.  MRI [**2190-7-6**] extremely limited but showed diffuse T2
   hyperintensities with broad differential including PRES, infection,
   seizure, toxins.  All cultures negative to date including CSF and
   mycolytic cultures.  HSV PCR pending from CSF.  EEG without seizure
   activity.  Transthoracic echocardiogram negative for vegetation.  She
   was intubated [**2190-7-7**] and received TEE which was without vegitation.
   Repeat MRI also performed, results pending.
   - LP without clear signs of infection, culture pending, HSV PCR pending
   - Thiamine, folate, multivitamin
   - Ativan 2-4 mg IV Q2H:PRN CIWA > 10 for alcohol withdrawal (requiring
   significanlty less over past 24 hours)
   - f/u Neurologic recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - cont acyclovir, fluconazole for empiric coverage of meningitis
   pending MRI and HSV PCR
   - follow up [**Month/Day/Year **], urine, mycolytic cultures
   - f/u MRI read
   - will plan to extubate today
   - consider call out to floor in PM if stable
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 12.  Electrolytes stable.
   - holding oral agents
   - continue lantus with regular insulin sliding scale
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn
   Hypertension: [**Month/Day/Year 229**] presusres grossly elevated on presentation. Concern
   given new onset tachycardiac that this may be related to alcohol versus
   benzodiazepine withdrawal. No improvement in [**Month/Day/Year **] pressures despite
   home antihypertensive regimen yesterday although per husband baseline
   [**Name2 (NI) **] pressures range from 150s to 180s.
   - hydralazine 5-10 mg IV Q4H:PRN for SBP > 200
   - continue home meds lisinopril, metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide
   - will increase metoprolol to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for septic right knee infection. The patient was intubated and received invasive ventilation, which was stopped 24 hours prior to the note.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Altered mental status: unclear etiology, likely related to alcohol withdrawal and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)
* Fever: 101.7°F
* Hypertension: systolic blood pressure (SBP) 180-190 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 70-80 mmHg
* Tachycardia: heart rate (HR) 120-130 beats per minute (bpm)
* Respiratory support: nasal cannula oxygen delivery, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 cmH2O
* Laboratory results:
	+ White blood cell count (WBC): 13.1-11.7 K/uL
	+ Hemoglobin (Hb): 10.6-9.1 g/dL
	+ Platelet count (Plt): 362-343 K/uL
	+ Creatinine (Cr): 1.0-1.1 mg/dL
	+ Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 18-16 mg/dL
	+ Electrolytes: normal
	+ Blood glucose: 228-164 mg/dL
* Imaging studies:
	+ Head CT: multiple areas of hypodensities
	+ MRI: diffuse T2 hyperintensities with broad differential including PRES, infection, seizure, and toxins
	+ Transthoracic echocardiogram: negative for vegetation
	+ TEE: negative for vegetation

The patient has the following medical conditions:

* Diabetes mellitus (DM), type II
* Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)
* Arthritis, septic (knee infection)
* Urinary tract infection (UTI)
* Hypertension, benign
* Alcohol withdrawal (including delirium tremens, DTS, seizures)

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antihypertensive medications: hydralazine, metoprolol
* Insulin therapy: regular insulin sliding scale
* Antibiotics: meropenem for ESBL E. coli
* Antifungal therapy: fluconazole for fungal knee infection
* Sedation: Ativan for CIWA scale
* Pain management: as needed

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Seizures: due to alcohol withdrawal or PRES
* Infection: sepsis, meningitis, or UTI
* Hypertensive crisis: due to uncontrolled blood pressure
* Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): due to inadequate insulin therapy
* Fungal sepsis: due to fungal knee infection
* Cardiovascular complications: due to hypertension and septic shock

The patient's disposition is currently in the ICU, and the plan is to extubate her today. Further management will depend on the results of pending laboratory tests and imaging studies."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), septic arthritis, urinary tract infection (UTI), and hypertension. He was previously treated with antibiotics, but his condition has not improved. He was extubated and started on a scheduled regimen of medications, including hydralazine and metoprolol, to control his blood pressure. He was also started on meropenem for his UTI.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 101.7°F, heart rate 96-120 beats per minute, blood pressure 192/72 mmHg, and respiratory rate 25-31 breaths per minute. He is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 98%.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, but he is not alert. His HEENT examination is normal, and his lung fields are clear to auscultation. His cardiovascular examination reveals a regular heart rhythm and normal S1 and S2 sounds. His abdominal examination is normal, and his GU examination reveals a Foley catheter draining cloudy yellow urine.

The patient's laboratory results show the following: white blood cell count 13.1 K/uL, hemoglobin 10.6 g/dL, platelet count 343 K/uL, and blood urea nitrogen 108 mg/dL. His serum creatinine is 1.1 mg/dL, and his glucose is 228 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's UTI and septic arthritis put him at risk for developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and even death.
2. Meningitis: The patient's UTI and septic arthritis also increase the risk of developing meningitis, which can lead to severe neurological complications.
3. Kidney damage: The patient's UTI and septic arthritis may cause kidney damage, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's septic arthritis and UTI may cause respiratory failure, which can lead to the need for mechanical ventilation.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and septic shock may cause cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or cardiac failure.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's PRES and septic shock may cause neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or encephalopathy.
7. Infection: The patient's UTI and septic arthritis may lead to the development of other infections, such as pneumonia, bloodstream infections, or skin infections.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's UTI and septic arthritis may cause gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
9. Wound infection: The patient's surgical site infection may lead to the development of a wound infection, which can cause further complications.
10. End-organ damage: The patient's septic shock and UTI may cause end-organ damage, such as kidney damage, liver damage, or pancreatitis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Microbiology:
   Blood and urine cultures from [**2190-7-8**]
 pending
   Imaging:
   MRI Brain:  Extensive white matter abnormalities involving the
   posterior distribution as well as extending to involve the frontal and
   parietal lobes in a watershed distribution. Given the conciliation of
   these findings, these are again most concerning for posterior
   reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Again differential considerations
   include a toxic or metabolic process.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Likely
   initially in setting of alcohol withdrawal, now past time course. MRI
   suggestive of component of PRES.  All cultures negative to date
   including CSF and mycolytic cultures and HSV PCR.  TTE and TEE without
   vegetation.  [**Month (only) 11**] have component from pain. Mental status slowly
   improving.
   - empiric abx for meningitis discontinued
   - cultures from admission negative to date
   - aggressively manage blood pressure with target pressures at her
   baseline of 150-160
   - will change metoprolol to labetolol for BP control today
   - d/c valium
   - lidoderm patch
   Fevers:  Spiked a fever to 101 last night. Currently treating fungal
   knee infection. [**Month (only) 11**] have aspiration pneumonia in setting of AMS. UTI
   also possible given foley catheter and positive UA.  She has a history
   of ESBL so she was started on meropenem. Blood cultures and urine
   cultures pending.
   - CXR today
   - Add vancomycin for gram positive coverage
   - Cont meropenem day [**2-6**] for urinary tract infection pending cultures
   - Cont fluconazole
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.
   - continue fluconazole, plan for 6+ weeks of therapy to be readdressed
   by ID as outpatient
   - TEE negative; will need ophtho consult and HIV testing as well
   - orthopedics removed staples feel wound healing well
   - deferring tap for now
   - lidoderm patch for right knee
   Hypertension: Blood pressures grossly elevated on presentation likely
   from alcohol withdrawal and essential hypertension without improvement
   overnight despite uptitration of antihypertensives. Per her husband her
   baseline blood pressures range in the 150s-160s.
   - hydralazine 20 IV Q6H
   - will change metoprolol to labetolol 400 mg TID and will titrate up
   prn today
   - lisinopril 40 mg daily
   - continue hydrochlorothiazide
   - PO valium for CIWA scale
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 13.  Electrolytes stable.  Lantus increased to 25 yesterday with
   increase in her sliding scale.
   - holding oral agents
   - continue lantus with regular insulin sliding scale
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: ICU pending improvement hypertension and mental status<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for septic right knee. She presents from home with one day of confusion, altered mental status, and fever.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 101.7°F, HR 96 bpm, BP 192/72 mmHg, RR 25 inspirations per minute, SpO2 98%.
* Neurological status: PERRL, EOMI, no facial droop, moves all extremities, withdraws to pain symmetrically.
* Laboratory results:
	+ WBC: 13.1 K/uL
	+ Hct: 31.3%
	+ Plt: 343 K/uL
	+ Cr: 1.0 mg/dL
	+ Glucose: 228 mg/dL
	+ Other labs: PT/PTT/INR 12.9/22.5/1.1, Lactic Acid 0.9 mmol/L, Ca++ 9.0 mg/dL, Mg++ 1.9 mg/dL, PO4 3.2 mg/dL
* Imaging: MRI brain shows extensive white matter abnormalities, concerning for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).
* Medical history: Recent admission for septic right knee, fluconazole for fungal infection, history of ESBL E. coli in urine.
* Current medications: Meropenem, fluconazole, metoprolol, hydralazine, famotidine, lidoderm patch.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Severe hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, which can lead to cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or stroke.
* Infection: The patient has a history of ESBL E. coli in urine and is currently being treated for a fungal knee infection. The blood cultures and urine cultures are pending, and the patient may develop a secondary infection.
* PRES: The patient's MRI brain shows extensive white matter abnormalities, which can lead to PRES, a condition characterized by reversible encephalopathy, headache, and seizures.
* DKA: The patient has a history of type II diabetes and was admitted with DKA, which has now been resolved with insulin drip and IVF. However, the patient may still be at risk for DKA recurrence.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient is receiving insulin therapy and may be at risk for hypoglycemia, especially if the insulin dose is not adjusted properly.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction.

The patient's current plan of care includes:

* Aggressive blood pressure management with target pressures at her baseline of 150-160 mmHg.
* Continued treatment for fungal knee infection with fluconazole.
* Empiric antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infection pending cultures.
* Monitoring of blood glucose levels and adjustment of insulin therapy as needed.
* Monitoring of electrolyte levels and repletion as needed.
* Further evaluation of the patient's neurological status and potential underlying causes of her altered mental status."

 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal with a component of PRES. Repeat
   MRI most consistent with PRES.  All cultures negative to date including
   CSF and mycolytic cultures and HSV PCR.  TTE and TEE without
   vegetation.  Mental status slowly improving.
   - d/c acyclovir as HSV PCR negative
   - cultures from admission negative to date
   - aggressively manage blood pressure with target pressures at her
   baseline of 150-160
   - will add labetolol for BP control today
   - will change to valium Q6H CIWA today in anticipation of floor
   transfer
   - consider call out to floor this evening if blood pressures stable
   Fevers:  Spiked a fever to 101 last night.  Most likely etiology is
   urinary tract infection as patient had foley catheter and positive UA.
   She has a history of ESBL so she was started on meropenem. Blood
   cultures and urine cultures pending.
   - meropenem day [**2-6**] for urinary tract infection pending cultures
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 13.  Electrolytes stable.  Lantus increased to 25 yesterday with
   increase in her sliding scale.
   - holding oral agents
   - continue lantus with regular insulin sliding scale
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn
   Hypertension: Blood pressures grossly elevated on presentation likely
   from alcohol withdrawal and essential hypertension.  Per her husband
   her baseline blood pressures range in the 150s-160s.
   - hydralazine 20 IV Q6H
   - will add labetolol 400 mg TID and will titrate up today
   - discontinue metoprolol
   - lisinopril 40 mg daily
   - continue hydrochlorothiazide
   - PO valium for CIWA scale
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.
   - continue fluconazole, plan for 6+ weeks of therapy to be readdressed
   by ID as outpatient
   - TEE negative; will need ophtho consult and HIV testing as well
   - orthopedics removed staples feel wound healing well
   - deferring tap for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal with a component of PRES. Repeat
   MRI most consistent with PRES.  All cultures negative to date including
   CSF and mycolytic cultures and HSV PCR.  TTE and TEE without
   vegetation.  Mental status slowly improving.
   - d/c acyclovir as HSV PCR negative
   - cultures from admission negative to date
   - aggressively manage blood pressure with target pressures at her
   baseline of 150-160
   - will add labetolol for BP control today
   - will change to valium Q6H CIWA today in anticipation of floor
   transfer
   - consider call out to floor this evening if blood pressures stable
   Fevers:  Spiked a fever to 101 last night.  Most likely etiology is
   urinary tract infection as patient had foley catheter and positive UA.
   She has a history of ESBL so she was started on meropenem. Blood
   cultures and urine cultures pending.
   - meropenem day [**2-6**] for urinary tract infection pending cultures
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 13.  Electrolytes stable.  Lantus increased to 25 yesterday with
   increase in her sliding scale.
   - holding oral agents
   - continue lantus with regular insulin sliding scale
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn
   Hypertension: Blood pressures grossly elevated on presentation likely
   from alcohol withdrawal and essential hypertension.  Per her husband
   her baseline blood pressures range in the 150s-160s.
   - hydralazine 20 IV Q6H
   - will add labetolol 400 mg TID and will titrate up today
   - discontinue metoprolol
   - lisinopril 40 mg daily
   - continue hydrochlorothiazide
   - PO valium for CIWA scale

   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.
   - continue fluconazole, plan for 6+ weeks of therapy to be readdressed
   by ID as outpatient
   - TEE negative; will need ophtho consult and HIV testing as well
   - orthopedics removed staples feel wound healing well

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for septic right knee. She presents from home with one day of confusion. She has altered mental status, which is likely due to alcohol withdrawal with a component of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Her blood pressure is grossly elevated, likely due to alcohol withdrawal and essential hypertension. She has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is on meropenem. Her glucose control is being managed with insulin drip and IVF.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizures: The patient has a history of ESBL E. coli in her urine, and her blood pressure is not well-controlled. This increases the risk of seizures.
2. Infection: The patient has a UTI and a fungal knee infection, and her blood cultures and urine cultures are pending. She is at risk of developing a secondary infection.
3. Hypertensive Crisis: The patient's blood pressure is grossly elevated, and she is at risk of developing a hypertensive crisis.
4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's glucose control is being managed with insulin drip and IVF, but she is at risk of developing DKA due to her type II diabetes.
5. Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES): The patient has a diagnosis of PRES, which is a serious condition that can lead to permanent brain damage if not managed properly.
6. Fungal Infection: The patient has a fungal knee infection, and her fluconazole therapy may not be adequate to treat the infection.
7. Septic Joint Infection: The patient has a septic right knee, and her joint may become infected if not properly managed.
8. Vascular Complications: The patient has peripheral vascular disease, and her blood pressure is not well-controlled. This increases the risk of vascular complications, such as aortic dissection or peripheral artery occlusion.
9. Respiratory Complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and she is at risk of developing respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or respiratory failure.

These potential medical complications highlight the need for close monitoring and aggressive management of the patient's conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-inch tall, 75.6 kg male who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, diabetes mellitus type II, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, septic arthritis, urinary tract infection, hypertension, and alcohol withdrawal.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 101.7°F (38.7°C)
* Heart rate: 96-120 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 192/72 mmHg (104/65 mmHg) with target SBP 150-160 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 25-31 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%

The patient has been on invasive ventilation and was extubated. He has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and hypertension. His blood cultures and urine culture are pending. He has a history of ESBL E. coli in his urine, and therefore, was started on meropenem.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 13.1-11.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.6-10.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 362-343 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.0-1.1 mg/dL
* Glucose: 194-228 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 12.9/22.5/1.1, Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L, Ca++: 9.0 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 3.2 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is as follows:

* Peripheral vascular: Not assessed
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: Responds to verbal commands, but movement and tone are not assessed

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to the presence of ESBL E. coli in the urine and the patient's fever and tachycardia
* Acute kidney injury due to the patient's hypertension and hypovolemia
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying respiratory disease and the need for invasive ventilation
* Neurological complications due to the patient's posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and the need for further neuroimaging
* Cardiovascular complications due to the patient's hypertension and the need for further cardiovascular monitoring
* Infections due to the patient's altered mental status and the need for further antimicrobial therapy."

   Microbiology:
   Blood and urine cultures from [**2190-7-8**]
 pending
   Imaging:
   MRI Brain:  Extensive white matter abnormalities involving the
   posterior distribution as well as extending to involve the frontal and
   parietal lobes in a watershed distribution. Given the conciliation of
   these findings, these are again most concerning for posterior
   reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Again differential considerations
   include a toxic or metabolic process.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal with a component of PRES. Repeat
   MRI most consistent with PRES.  All cultures negative to date including
   CSF and mycolytic cultures and HSV PCR.  TTE and TEE without
   vegetation.  Mental status slowly improving.
   - d/c acyclovir as HSV PCR negative
   - cultures from admission negative to date
   - aggressively manage blood pressure with target pressures at her
   baseline of 150-160
   - will change metoprolol to labetolol for BP control today
   - will change to valium Q6H CIWA today in anticipation of floor
   transfer
   - consider call out to floor this evening if blood pressures stable
   Fevers:  Spiked a fever to 101 last night.  Most likely etiology is
   urinary tract infection as patient had foley catheter and positive UA.
   She has a history of ESBL so she was started on meropenem. Blood
   cultures and urine cultures pending.
   - meropenem day [**2-6**] for urinary tract infection pending cultures
   - CXR today
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 13.  Electrolytes stable.  Lantus increased to 25 yesterday with
   increase in her sliding scale.
   - holding oral agents
   - continue lantus with regular insulin sliding scale
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn
   Hypertension: Blood pressures grossly elevated on presentation likely
   from alcohol withdrawal and essential hypertension without improvement
   overnight despite uptitration of antihypertensives. Per her husband her
   baseline blood pressures range in the 150s-160s.
   - hydralazine 20 IV Q6H
   - will change metoprolol to labetolol 400 mg TID and will titrate up
   prn today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Microbiology:
   Blood and urine cultures from [**2190-7-8**]
 pending
   Imaging:
   MRI Brain:  Extensive white matter abnormalities involving the
   posterior distribution as well as extending to involve the frontal and
   parietal lobes in a watershed distribution. Given the conciliation of
   these findings, these are again most concerning for posterior
   reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Again differential considerations
   include a toxic or metabolic process.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal with a component of PRES. Repeat
   MRI most consistent with PRES.  All cultures negative to date including
   CSF and mycolytic cultures and HSV PCR.  TTE and TEE without
   vegetation.  Mental status slowly improving.
   - d/c acyclovir as HSV PCR negative
   - cultures from admission negative to date
   - aggressively manage blood pressure with target pressures at her
   baseline of 150-160
   - will change metoprolol to labetolol for BP control today
   - will change to valium Q6H CIWA today in anticipation of floor
   transfer
   - consider call out to floor this evening if blood pressures stable
   Fevers:  Spiked a fever to 101 last night.  Most likely etiology is
   urinary tract infection as patient had foley catheter and positive UA.
   She has a history of ESBL so she was started on meropenem. Blood
   cultures and urine cultures pending.
   - meropenem day [**2-6**] for urinary tract infection pending cultures
   - CXR today
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 13.  Electrolytes stable.  Lantus increased to 25 yesterday with
   increase in her sliding scale.
   - holding oral agents
   - continue lantus with regular insulin sliding scale
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn
   Hypertension: Blood pressures grossly elevated on presentation likely
   from alcohol withdrawal and essential hypertension without improvement
   overnight despite uptitration of antihypertensives. Per her husband her
   baseline blood pressures range in the 150s-160s.
   - hydralazine 20 IV Q6H
   - will change metoprolol to labetolol 400 mg TID and will titrate up
   prn today
   - lisinopril 40 mg daily
   - continue hydrochlorothiazide
   - PO valium for CIWA scale
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.
   - continue fluconazole, plan for 6+ weeks of therapy to be readdressed
   by ID as outpatient
   - TEE negative; will need ophtho consult and HIV testing as well
   - orthopedics removed staples feel wound healing well
   - deferring tap for now

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for septic right knee infection. She was started on fluconazole for fungal knee infection and was previously on gentamicin, vancomycin, and acyclovir.

Current issues:

1. Altered mental status: The patient continues to have unclear etiology, with most likely sources being alcohol withdrawal and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Repeat MRI is most consistent with PRES.
2. Fever: The patient spiked a fever to 101.7°F last night, which is likely due to urinary tract infection (UTI). Blood cultures and urine cultures are pending.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures are grossly elevated, likely due to alcohol withdrawal and essential hypertension. Despite uptitration of antihypertensives, blood pressures have not improved.
4. Fungal knee infection: The patient has a history of fungal knee infection, and cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**]. She is being treated with fluconazole and is followed by the infectious disease service.

Potential medical complications:

1. Seizures: The patient is at risk for seizures due to the diagnosis of PRES.
2. UTI: The patient has a history of ESBL E. coli in urine and is at risk for developing a UTI.
3. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressures are grossly elevated, and she is at risk for developing a hypertensive crisis.
4. Fungal infection: The patient has a history of fungal knee infection and is at risk for developing further fungal infections.
5. DKA: The patient has a history of type II diabetes and is at risk for developing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) due to her altered mental status and insulin therapy.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing further infections due to her immunocompromised state and the presence of invasive lines and catheters.

Plan:

1. Continue to aggressively manage blood pressure with target pressures at her baseline of 150-160 mmHg.
2. Change metoprolol to labetolol for BP control today.
3. Continue fluconazole for fungal knee infection.
4. Monitor lytes daily and replete prn.
5. Hold oral agents for diabetes and continue lantus with regular insulin sliding scale.
6. Consider calling out to the floor this evening if blood pressures are stable.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust therapy as necessary.
8. Order a CXR today to evaluate for any signs of pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's urine output and adjust fluid management as necessary.
10. Consider consulting with ophthalmology and HIV testing as part of the patient's care plan."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Total time spent: 30 minutes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient is a 47-year-old female admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, possibly due to recent fungal septic arthritis, DKA, and EtOH withdrawal. She has been treated for DKA and EtOH withdrawal, and her mental status has been stable. However, she developed a fever overnight with a new R basilar infiltrate, which may indicate aspiration or nosocomial pneumonia. Imaging studies, including a CXR and MRI brain, have revealed posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.7°F (38.7°C)
* Blood pressure: 182/83 mmHg
* Heart rate: 89 bpm
* Respiratory rate: 29 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 98%

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.7 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 31.3%
* Platelet count: 343 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Glucose: 228 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: normal
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
* Calcium: 9.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.2 mg/dL

The patient has been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem, and antifungal medication, including fluconazole. She has also received medications for DKA and EtOH withdrawal.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the new R basilar infiltrate, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia, which may require further antibiotics and respiratory support.
2. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient's fever and infiltrate may also indicate nosocomial pneumonia, which may require additional antibiotics and respiratory support.
3. PRES: The patient's MRI brain suggests PRES, which may require further monitoring and management to prevent worsening of the condition.
4. DKA: Although the patient's DKA has been managed, there is still a risk of recurrence, especially if her glucose control is not maintained.
5. EtOH withdrawal: The patient's EtOH withdrawal may continue to pose a risk of seizures, hallucinations, and other complications if not managed properly.
6. Fungal septic arthritis: The patient's fungal septic arthritis may require ongoing antifungal treatment and monitoring to prevent worsening of the condition.
7. HTN: The patient's hypertension may require further management to prevent complications, such as stroke and cardiac damage.
8. DVT: The patient's risk of DVT is increased due to her immobility and may require prophylactic anticoagulation.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including aspiration pneumonia, nosocomial pneumonia, PRES, DKA, EtOH withdrawal, fungal septic arthritis, HTN, and DVT. Close monitoring and management of these conditions are essential to prevent worsening of the patient's condition and ensure her recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female admitted with altered mental status, recent fungal septic arthritis, and DKA/EtOH withdrawal. The patient has a complex medical history, including HTN, and is currently receiving treatment for multiple conditions.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 101.7°F (38.7°C)
* Heart rate: 89 bpm (normal range: 77-120 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 182/83 mmHg (normal range: 110/65-206/114 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 29 breaths per minute (normal range: 18-31 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 98% (normal range: 95-100%)
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm (normal)

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 13.1 K/uL (normal range: 4.5-11.0 K/uL)
* Hematocrit: 33.6% (normal range: 37-52%)
* Platelet count: 362 K/uL (normal range: 150-450 K/uL)
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Blood urea nitrogen: 228 mg/dL (normal range: 7-20 mg/dL)
* Glucose: 228 mg/dL (normal range: 70-110 mg/dL)
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L (normal range: 0.5-2.0 mmol/L)
* Calcium: 9.0 mg/dL (normal range: 8.5-10.5 mg/dL)
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL (normal range: 1.7-2.3 mg/dL)
* Phosphorus: 3.2 mg/dL (normal range: 2.5-4.5 mg/dL)

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Broadening antibiotic coverage to vancomycin and meropenem
* Tightening blood pressure control for possible posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)
* Managing DKA and EtOH withdrawal
* Continuing treatment for fungal septic arthritis with fluconazole
* Monitoring for potential aspiration or nosocomial pneumonia
* Scheduling an EEG to rule out seizure activity
* Ordering a chest X-ray to evaluate for possible pneumonia
* Monitoring the patient's mental status and adjusting treatment as necessary

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to fungal septic arthritis or DKA
* Respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to pneumonia or aspiration
* Stroke or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) due to HTN or other underlying conditions
* Worsening of DKA or EtOH withdrawal symptoms
* Development of secondary infections, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs) or central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs)
* Cardiovascular complications, such as hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias, due to HTN or other underlying conditions.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her complex medical conditions to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for septic right knee infection. She presented from home with one day of confusion and altered mental status, initially thought to be due to alcohol withdrawal, but now suspected to have a component of PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome). Cultures have been negative to date, including CSF and mycolytic cultures and HSV PCR. She has a history of ESBL (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase) and was started on meropenem. She has a spiked fever, and treatment includes vancomycin for gram-positive coverage and fluconazole for fungal knee infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Meningitis: Although cultures have been negative to date, the patient's symptoms and clinical presentation are concerning for meningitis. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to rule out this diagnosis.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's altered mental status and recent aspiration of oral secretions increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to rule out this diagnosis.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's history of ESBL and positive urine culture increase the risk of UTI. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to rule out this diagnosis.
4. Fungal Knee Infection: The patient's fungal knee infection is being treated with fluconazole, but further evaluation and treatment are necessary to ensure proper treatment and prevent complications.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures are grossly elevated, and further evaluation and treatment are necessary to manage this condition and prevent complications.
6. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes is being managed with insulin drip and IVF, but further evaluation and treatment are necessary to ensure proper management and prevent complications.
7. PRES: The patient's symptoms and clinical presentation are concerning for PRES, and further evaluation and treatment are necessary to rule out this diagnosis and prevent complications.
8. Sepsis: The patient's septic right knee infection increases the risk of sepsis, and further evaluation and treatment are necessary to monitor for this condition and prevent complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood cultures and urine cultures to ensure proper treatment and prevent complications.

   Microbiology:
   Blood and urine cultures from [**2190-7-8**]
 no growth to date
   Imaging:
   As compared to the previous radiograph, a PICC line has been
   inserted over the right upper extremity. The PICC line terminates in
   the
   superior vena cava and could be advanced by 3-4 cm. In the interval,
   the
   patient has been extubated. The nasogastric tube, however, is in
   unchanged
   position. There is no evidence of interval recurrence of focal
   parenchymal
   opacity suggestive of pneumonia. No pleural effusions. Normal size of
   the
   cardiac silhouette without evidence of overhydration.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Likely initially in setting of alcohol
   withdrawal, now past time course. MRI suggestive of component of PRES.
   All cultures negative to date including CSF and mycolytic cultures and
   HSV PCR.  TTE and TEE without vegetation.  [**Month (only) 11**] have component from
   pain. Mental status slowly improving.
   - empiric abx for meningitis discontinued
   - cultures from admission negative to date
   - aggressively manage blood pressure with target pressures at her
   baseline of 150-160
   - continue labetolol 400 mg TID, hydralazine 30 mg PO Q6H,
   hydrochlorothiazie 25 mg daily and lisinopril 40 mg daily
   - lidoderm patch for pain
   Fevers:  Spiked a fever to 101 last night. Currently treating fungal
   knee infection. [**Month (only) 11**] have aspiration pneumonia in setting of AMS
   although CXR yesterday looked clear.  UA trace positive but culture
   negative to date.  Currently on vancomycin and meropenem given history
   of ESBL in her urine.
   - continue vancomycin and meropenem pending culture date
   - follow blood, urine and sputum samples
   - Cont fluconazole
   - will need to readdress joint aspiration
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.
   - continue fluconazole, plan for 6+ weeks of therapy to be readdressed
   by ID as outpatient
   - TEE negative; will need ophtho consult and HIV testing as well
   - orthopedics removed staples feel wound healing well
   - will discuss joint aspiration with orthopedics, likely will defer
   given improved appearance of wound
   - lidoderm patch for right knee
   Hypertension: Blood pressures grossly elevated on presentation likely
   initially from alcohol withdrawal and essential hypertension. Per her
   husband her baseline blood pressures range in the 150s-160s.  Now
   improved to close to target with PO hydralazine, labetolol,
   hydrochlorithiazide and lisinopril
   - continue hydralazine 30 mg PO Q6H, labetolol 400 mg TID,
   hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily and lisinopril 40 mg daily
   - will titrate up labetolol today as tolerated today
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 13.  Electrolytes stable.  Blood sugars persistently in the 300s
   overnight.
   - holding oral agents
   - increase lantus to 30 U daily with regular insulin sliding scale
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Likely initially in setting of alcohol
   withdrawal, now past time course. MRI suggestive of component of PRES.
   All cultures negative to date including CSF and mycolytic cultures and
   HSV PCR.  TTE and TEE without vegetation.  [**Month (only) 11**] have component from
   pain. Mental status slowly improving.
   - empiric abx for meningitis discontinued
   - cultures from admission negative to date
   - aggressively manage blood pressure with target pressures at her
   baseline of 150-160
   - continue labetolol 400 mg TID, hydralazine 30 mg PO Q6H,
   hydrochlorothiazie 25 mg daily and lisinopril 40 mg daily
   - lidoderm patch for pain
   Fevers:  Spiked a fever to 101 last night. Currently treating fungal
   knee infection. [**Month (only) 11**] have aspiration pneumonia in setting of AMS
   although CXR yesterday looked clear.  UA trace positive but culture
   negative to date.  Currently on vancomycin and meropenem given history
   of ESBL in her urine.
   - continue vancomycin and meropenem pending culture date
   - follow blood, urine and sputum samples
   - Cont fluconazole
   - will need to readdress joint aspiration
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.
   - continue fluconazole, plan for 6+ weeks of therapy to be readdressed
   by ID as outpatient
   - TEE negative; will need ophtho consult and HIV testing as well
   - orthopedics removed staples feel wound healing well
   - will discuss joint aspiration with orthopedics, likely will defer
   given improved appearance of wound
   - lidoderm patch for right knee
   Hypertension: Blood pressures grossly elevated on presentation likely
   initially from alcohol withdrawal and essential hypertension. Per her
   husband her baseline blood pressures range in the 150s-160s.  Now
   improved to close to target with PO hydralazine, labetolol,
   hydrochlorithiazide and lisinopril
   - continue hydralazine 30 mg PO Q6H, labetolol 400 mg TID,
   hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily and lisinopril 40 mg daily
   - will titrate up labetolol today as tolerated today
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 13.  Electrolytes stable.  Blood sugars persistently in the 300s

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for septic right knee. She presented from home with one day of confusion, likely initially due to alcohol withdrawal. Her mental status has slowly improved, and an MRI suggests a component of PRES.

The patient has been diagnosed with a fungal knee infection, and cultures from June 16 grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**]. She has been on fluconazole and is being followed by the infectious disease service.

The patient has also been diagnosed with hypertension, which was grossly elevated on presentation, likely due to alcohol withdrawal and essential hypertension. Her blood pressures are now close to target with PO hydralazine, labetolol, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril.

The patient's diabetes is type II, insulin-dependent, and she likely presented with DKA, which has now been resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Her anion gap is 13, and her electrolytes are stable. She is being treated with lantus and regular insulin sliding scale.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.1°C (100.5°F)
* Heart rate: 82 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 181/71 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 29 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 99%

The patient's physical examination is notable for a clear lung field, regular heart rhythm, and soft, non-tender abdomen. Her neurologic examination is normal, with no facial droop or weakness.

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 13.1 K/uL
* Hct: 33.6%
* Plt: 362 K/uL
* Cr: 1.0 mg/dL
* Glucose: 194 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 12.9/22.5/1.1, Lactic Acid: 0.9 mmol/L, Ca++: 9.7 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL, PO4: 3.2 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show a PICC line inserted over the right upper extremity, which terminates in the superior vena cava and could be advanced by 3-4 cm. There is no evidence of interval recurrence of focal parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue fluconazole for 6+ weeks of therapy
* Readdress joint aspiration with orthopedics
* Monitor blood pressure with target pressures at 150-160 mmHg
* Continue labetolol 400 mg TID, hydralazine 30 mg PO Q6H, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily, and lisinopril 40 mg daily
* Increase lantus to 30 U daily with regular insulin sliding scale
* Monitor electrolytes daily and replete as needed
* Continue lidoderm patch for pain

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Septic shock due to fungal knee infection
* Meningitis or encephalitis due to HSV or other pathogens
* DKA or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome due to uncontrolled diabetes
* Hypertensive crisis due to uncontrolled hypertension
* Pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis due to immobility
* Aspiration pneumonia due to altered mental status and poor airway protection
* Fungal sepsis due to fluconazole-resistant organisms

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Microbiology:
   Blood and urine cultures from [**2190-7-8**]
 no growth to date
   Imaging: CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, a PICC line has
   been inserted over the right upper extremity. The PICC line terminates
   in the superior vena cava and could be advanced by 3-4 cm. In the
   interval, the patient has been extubated. The nasogastric tube,
   however, is in unchanged position. There is no evidence of interval
   recurrence of focal parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia. No
   pleural effusions. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette without
   evidence of overhydration.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Now improved, likely due to resolution of
   alcohol withdrawal and improved management of PRES.  All cultures
   negative to date including CSF and mycolytic cultures and HSV PCR.  TTE
   and TEE without vegetation.  [**Month (only) 11**] have component from pain. Mental
   status slowly improving.
   - empiric abx for meningitis discontinued
   - cultures from admission negative to date
   - aggressively manage blood pressure with target pressures at her
   baseline of 150-160
   - continue labetolol 400 mg TID, hydralazine 30 mg PO Q6H,
   hydrochlorothiazie 25 mg daily and lisinopril 40 mg daily
   - lidoderm patch for pain
   Fevers:  Fever curve improved. Currently treating fungal knee
   infection. No new positive micro to date.
   - d/c abx
   - Cont fluconazole
   - follow blood, urine and sputum samples
   - will need to readdress joint aspiration; pending ID and Ortho
   discussion
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.
   - continue fluconazole, plan for 6+ weeks of therapy to be readdressed
   by ID as outpatient
   - TEE negative; will need ophtho consult and HIV testing as well
   - orthopedics removed staples feel wound healing well
   - will discuss joint aspiration with orthopedics and ID
   - lidoderm patch for right knee
   Hypertension: Blood pressures grossly elevated on presentation likely
   initially from alcohol withdrawal and essential hypertension. Per her
   husband her baseline blood pressures range in the 150s-160s.  Now
   improved to close to target with PO hydralazine, labetolol,
   hydrochlorithiazide and lisinopril
   - continue hydralazine 30 mg PO Q6H, labetolol 400 mg TID,
   hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily and lisinopril 40 mg daily
   - will titrate up labetolol today as tolerated today
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 13.  Electrolytes stable.  Blood sugars persistently in the 300s
   overnight.
   - holding oral agents
   - increase lantus to 30 U daily with regular insulin sliding scale
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn

   Disposition: Call-out to floor<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for septic right knee. She was initially admitted with altered mental status, likely due to resolution of alcohol withdrawal and improved management of PRES. Her mental status has slowly improved.

The patient has a fungal knee infection, which was cultured on [**2190-6-16**] and grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**]. She has been on fluconazole therapy for 6+ weeks, with plans to continue for 6+ weeks more.

The patient's blood pressures have been grossly elevated on presentation, likely initially from alcohol withdrawal and essential hypertension. Her baseline blood pressures range in the 150s-160s, and she is now improved to close to target with PO hydralazine, labetolol, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril.

The patient's diabetes is type II, insulin-dependent, and she presented with DKA, which is now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Her anion gap is 13, and her electrolytes are stable. Her blood sugars persistently in the 300s overnight.

The patient has a PICC line inserted over the right upper extremity, which terminates in the superior vena cava and can be advanced by 3-4 cm. She also has a nasogastric tube, which is in an unchanged position.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Fungal infection: The patient's fungal knee infection may not respond to fluconazole therapy, and alternative treatment options may be necessary.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures may not remain stable, and further adjustments to her medication regimen may be necessary.
3. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes may not be well-controlled, and further adjustments to her insulin regimen may be necessary.
4. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and septic right knee may indicate a systemic infection, which may not have been fully addressed.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's imaging studies do not show evidence of interval recurrence of focal parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia, but this does not rule out the possibility of pneumonia.
6. Pleural effusion: The patient's imaging studies do not show evidence of pleural effusion, but this does not rule out the possibility of pleural effusion.
7. Cardiac issues: The patient's cardiac silhouette appears normal on imaging studies, but this does not rule out the possibility of cardiac issues.

The patient's current treatment plan includes continued fluconazole therapy for her fungal knee infection, aggressive management of her blood pressure with target pressures at her baseline of 150-160, and continuation of her insulin regimen. She will also need to be followed closely for any changes in her condition and for potential complications."

   w/ neg cultures
   -CXR yest without infiltrates despite R basilar crackles; afebrile w/
   broadened ABX (vanco + meropenem in addition to fluconazole below)
   -per ID will stop vanco + meropenem
   Altered mental status- treated for DKA and EtOH withdrawal. MRI
   suggests PRES
   -EEG without seizure activity
   -DKA and EtOH mgmt as below
   -tighter BP control for poss PRES, see below
   -dc'd acyclovir for neg HSV PCR
   HTN: Rx with beta blocker, HCTZ and lisinopril, scheduled hydralazine
   -titrate up for tighter control given poss PRES as above
   Fungal septic arthritis- on fluconazole x at least 6wks total
   (currently approx 3 wks in)
   -has fluctuant area on R lateral aspect of knee which we are following
   clinically at this point, slightly improved today
   -Id svce has wanted R knee fluctuance tapped, which Ortho team has not
   wanted to do so. Have asked ID team to discuss w/ Ortho team directly
   -will need eventual Ophthal eval if hasnt had one.
   -TEE without vegetations
   -will need HIV at some point
   DKA- gap closed, stable control on home regimen + RISS. still holding
   glyburide
   Rest of plan as per housestaff note.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 47-year-old female admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, recent fungal septic arthritis, and DKA +/- EtOH withdrawal. The patient has been treated for DKA and EtOH withdrawal, and her mental status has improved. The patient has been diagnosed with PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome) based on MRI brain results.

The patient has been febrile on the previous night, but cultures have been negative. The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem) in addition to fluconazole for fungal septic arthritis. The patient's fungal septic arthritis is being treated with fluconazole for at least 6 weeks.

The patient has a fluctuant area on the right lateral aspect of her knee, which is being monitored clinically. The ID team has requested that the Ortho team tap the fluctuant area, but the Ortho team has declined. The patient will need an ophthalmologic evaluation at some point.

The patient's DKA has been managed with insulin and has been stable on her home regimen. The patient is currently receiving tube feeds and sliding-scale insulin for glycemic control.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's altered mental status and febrile episode may increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
2. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and exposure to antibiotics may increase the risk of nosocomial pneumonia.
3. Fungal septic arthritis: The patient's ongoing treatment with fluconazole may not be sufficient to treat the fungal septic arthritis, and the patient may require further treatment or surgical intervention.
4. PRES: The patient's PRES may worsen or persist if the underlying cause is not addressed, and the patient may require further treatment or monitoring.
5. DKA: The patient's DKA may recur if the patient's glucose levels become unstable or if the patient is not adequately treated.
6. EtOH withdrawal: The patient's EtOH withdrawal may worsen or persist if the patient is not adequately treated, and the patient may require further treatment or monitoring.
7. Bloodstream infection: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and exposure to antibiotics may increase the risk of bloodstream infection.
8. Wound infection: The patient's fluctuant area on the right lateral aspect of her knee may become infected, and the patient may require further treatment or surgical intervention.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   47 yo female admitted with altered mental status in the setting of
   recent fungal septic arthritis as well as DKA +/- EtOH withdrawal. MRI
   brain suggests PRES.
   Possible aspiration vs nosocomial pneumonia- febrile on [**7-8**] night but
   w/ neg cultures
   -CXR yest without infiltrates despite R basilar crackles; afebrile w/
   broadened ABX (vanco + meropenem in addition to fluconazole below)
   -per ID will stop vanco + meropenem
   Altered mental status- treated for DKA and EtOH withdrawal. MRI
   suggests PRES
   -EEG without seizure activity
   -DKA and EtOH mgmt as below
   -tighter BP control for poss PRES, see below
   -dc'd acyclovir for neg HSV PCR
   HTN: Rx with beta blocker, HCTZ and lisinopril, scheduled hydralazine
   -titrate up for tighter control given poss PRES as above
   Fungal septic arthritis- on fluconazole x at least 6wks total
   (currently approx 3 wks in)
   -has fluctuant area on R lateral aspect of knee which we are following
   clinically at this point, slightly improved today
   -Id svce has wanted R knee fluctuance tapped, which Ortho team has not
   wanted to do so. Have asked ID team to discuss w/ Ortho team directly
   -will need eventual Ophthal eval if hasnt had one.
   -TEE without vegetations
   -will need HIV at some point
   DKA- gap closed, stable control on home regimen + RISS. still holding
   glyburide
   Rest of plan as per housestaff note.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, recent fungal septic arthritis, and DKA/EtOH withdrawal. She has a history of PRES (Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome) on MRI brain.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, and blood pressure of 164/69 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99%. She has a slight fluctuance on the right lateral aspect of her knee, which is being monitored clinically.

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 13.1-11.7 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 33.6-30.4%
* Plt: 362-302 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 1.0-1.3 mg/dL
* Glucose: 194-325 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 12.9/22.5/1.1, Lactic Acid: 0.9 mmol/L, Ca++: 9.7 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL, PO4: 3.2 mg/dL

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem), antifungals (fluconazole), and antihypertensives (beta blocker, HCTZ, and lisinopril). She is also receiving nutrition through tube feeds and insulin for glycemic control.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient's febrile episode on the previous night, despite negative cultures, suggests the possibility of nosocomial pneumonia.
2. Aspiration: The patient's altered mental status and potential aspiration risk require close monitoring.
3. Fungal septic arthritis: The patient's fungal septic arthritis may progress or recur, requiring continued antifungal therapy.
4. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's hypertension may worsen, particularly with the possibility of PRES, requiring close blood pressure monitoring and titration of antihypertensive medications.
5. DKA/EtOH withdrawal: The patient's DKA/EtOH withdrawal requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications.
6. Infection: The patient's recent fungal septic arthritis and DKA/EtOH withdrawal make her susceptible to other infections, such as urinary tract infections or bloodstream infections.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's PRES and altered mental status may progress or recur, requiring close neurological monitoring and management.

In conclusion, the patient requires continued close monitoring and management to prevent and address potential complications."
