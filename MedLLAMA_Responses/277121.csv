   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7589**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient has massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen).
   Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT chest, and EKG.
   Tropononin wnl but BNP is markedly elevated.  Given recent GI bleeding
   due to crohn's disease, concern for use of TPA would be GI bleed and
   intracranial hemorrhage.  Patient is s/p 140 mg SC of lovenox at OSH.
   - heparin drip with bolus
   - mechanical ventilation; will ultimately try to wean FIO2 if possible
   - minimize PEEP to limit dead space ventillation
   - type and cross 4 units of PRBCs
   - ensure stable access in anticipation of possible lysis
   - TPA 100 mg over 2 hours if hypotensive or worsening respiratory
   status
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and HISS.
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - RISS and glargine
   - consider insulin drip if significant hyperglycemia and there is
   enough access for it
   .
   Crohns.  Patient has recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Most recent
   colonoscopy in [**5-2**] showed significant colonic inflammation.  He was
   observed in the MICU for GI bleed, but did not requiring blood
   transfusiosn.  He was put on prednisone taper at discharge.  Recently
   had worsening of symptoms with steroid taper so had to go up on
   prednisone dose from 15 to 17 last week.
   - stress dose steroids given that patient is on chronic steroids and is
   now critically ill; additionally, this might offer colonic protection
   in the setting of heparin bolus/drip and possible TPA
   .
   Hyperkalemia.  Likely due to acidosis and renal failure.
   - insulin/d50
   - sodium bicarb
   - IVFs
   - serial Lytes
   - Kayexelate
   .
   HTN.
   - hold antihypertensives
   .
   Renal failure.  Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow Cr
   .
   Leukocytosis.  Likely related to chronic steroid use.  No clear sign of
   infection.
   - monitor wbc, fever curve
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient, a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, Crohn's disease, and chronic steroid use, was admitted with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has a massive clot burden on computed tomography angiography (CTA) with significant hypoxia, and evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram, CT chest, and electrocardiogram (EKG). The patient's troponin levels are within normal limits, but brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is markedly elevated.

The patient has been started on heparin drip with bolus, mechanical ventilation, and is being closely monitored for potential lysis. The patient's type 2 diabetes is being managed with insulin and HISS, and the patient is at risk for hyperglycemia due to steroid use.

The patient has a recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease and has experienced worsening symptoms with steroid taper. The patient is receiving stress dose steroids to manage this.

The patient has hyperkalemia, likely due to acidosis and renal failure, and is being managed with insulin/d50, sodium bicarb, IVFs, and serial Lytes.

The patient has hypertension, which is being managed by holding antihypertensives. The patient has renal failure, and medications are being renally dosed. The patient has leukocytosis, likely related to chronic steroid use, and is being monitored for signs of infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE) progression: The patient's PE is massive, and there is a risk of further progression, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
2. Right heart strain: The patient's right heart strain can lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and even cardiac arrest.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart block, and even cardiac arrest if not managed properly.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure can worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and even uremic syndrome.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and chronic steroid use may increase the risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
6. GI bleeding: The patient's Crohn's disease and recent GI bleeding may increase the risk of further bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and death.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's chronic steroid use and hypertension may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac arrest.

To manage these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team, including intensivists, pulmonologists, cardiologists, nephrologists, and gastroenterologists."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7589**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient has massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen) upon
   presentation.  Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT
   chest, and EKG.  Tropononin mildly elevated and BNP is markedly
   elevated.  Given recent GI bleeding due to crohn's disease, concern for
   use of TPA would be GI bleed and intracranial hemorrhage.  Patient is
   s/p 140 mg SC of lovenox at OSH and now s/p lysis with marked
   improvement of respiratory status.
   - heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100
   - PS support trial with plan to extubate later today
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   - type and cross 6 units of PRBCs
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and [**Known lastname 5607**].
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - [**Last Name (LF) 5607**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] consider long acting insulin if improved
   .
   Crohns.  Patient has recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Most recent
   colonoscopy in [**5-2**] showed significant colonic inflammation.  He was
   observed in the MICU for GI bleed, but did not requiring blood
   transfusiosn.  He was put on prednisone taper at discharge.  Recently
   had worsening of symptoms with steroid taper so had to go up on
   prednisone dose from 15 to 17 last week.  Now with marroon colored
   stool in setting of s/p lysis and being on heparin drip.
   - stress dose steroids given that patient is on chronic steroids and is
   now critically ill; additionally, this might offer colonic protection
   in the setting of heparin bolus/drip and s/p tpa
   - type and crossed for 6 units
   - q 4-6 hour hcts
   .
   .
   Hypotension.  Likely related to massive PE.  Low CVPs suggest
   hypovelmia as well.
   - hold antihypertensives
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   .
   Renal failure.  Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow Cr
   .
   Leukocytosis.  Likely related to chronic steroid use.  No clear sign of
   infection.
   - monitor wbc, fever curve

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7589**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient has massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen) upon
   presentation.  Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT
   chest, and EKG.  Tropononin mildly elevated and BNP is markedly
   elevated.  Given recent GI bleeding due to crohn's disease, concern for
   use of TPA would be GI bleed and intracranial hemorrhage.  Patient is
   s/p 140 mg SC of lovenox at OSH and now s/p lysis with marked
   improvement of respiratory status.
   - heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100
   - PS support trial with plan to extubate later today
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   - type and cross 6 units of PRBCs
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and [**Known lastname 5607**].
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - [**Last Name (LF) 5607**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] consider long acting insulin if improved
   .
   Crohns.  Patient has recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Most recent
   colonoscopy in [**5-2**] showed significant colonic inflammation.  He was
   observed in the MICU for GI bleed, but did not requiring blood
   transfusiosn.  He was put on prednisone taper at discharge.  Recently
   had worsening of symptoms with steroid taper so had to go up on
   prednisone dose from 15 to 17 last week.  Now with marroon colored
   stool in setting of s/p lysis and being on heparin drip.
   - stress dose steroids given that patient is on chronic steroids and is
   now critically ill; additionally, this might offer colonic protection
   in the setting of heparin bolus/drip and s/p tpa
   - type and crossed for 6 units
   - q 4-6 hour hcts
   .
   .
   Hypotension.  Likely related to massive PE.  Low CVPs suggest
   hypovelmia as well.
   - hold antihypertensives
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   .
   Renal failure.  Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow Cr
   .
   Leukocytosis.  Likely related to chronic steroid use.  No clear sign of
   infection.
   - monitor wbc, fever curve
   .

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 56-year-old male admitted to the ICU with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure requiring intubation. He has a history of diabetes, hypertension, Crohn's disease, and is on steroids. The patient has a massive clot burden on computed tomography angiography (CTA) with significant hypoxia despite 100% oxygen. He has evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram, CT chest, and electrocardiogram (EKG). Troponin is mildly elevated, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is markedly elevated.

The patient was lysed at midnight, and his respiratory status improved significantly. He is currently on a heparin drip with a goal partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 60-100. The patient is also on a pulmonary support trial with plans to extubate later in the day.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 16.6-17.1 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 41.7-37.3%
* Plt: 355-267 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 1.3-1.3 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.02-0.05 ng/mL
* TCO2: 27-28 mmHg
* Glucose: 265-292 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Type 2 diabetes, controlled with glargine and [**Last Name (LF) 5607**]
* Crohn's disease, with recent diagnosis and recent colonoscopy showing significant colonic inflammation
* Hypertension
* Steroid use, which may lead to hyperglycemia

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pulmonary embolism (PE) recurrence
* Right heart failure
* Respiratory failure
* Hypotension
* Renal failure
* Leukocytosis
* Hyperglycemia
* GI bleeding
* Intracranial hemorrhage
* Infection

The patient's plan includes:

* Heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100
* PS support trial with plans to extubate later in the day
* IVF boluses for low CVP
* Type and cross 6 units of PRBCs
* Stress dose steroids
* Renally dose all medications
* Monitor WBC and fever curve
* Follow Cr levels

The patient's family meeting was held, and ICU consent was signed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease who presented with several days of shortness of breath and was diagnosed with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's condition has improved after lysis of the PE, with improved hemodynamics and gas exchange.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.1°C (98.8°F)
* Heart rate: 97 bpm (normal range: 60-100 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 122/72 mmHg (normal range: 90-140/60-90 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute (normal range: 12-20 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 97% (normal range: 95-100%)

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Tachycardia
* Tachypnea
* Fever
* Abdominal tenderness
* Obese
* Soft and non-tender abdomen
* Normal bowel sounds
* Absent radial and dorsal pedal pulses

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 11.7 g/dL (normal range: 13.5-17.5 g/dL)
* White blood cell count: 16.6 K/uL (normal range: 4.5-11.0 K/uL)
* Platelet count: 355 K/uL (normal range: 150-450 K/uL)
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Troponin-T: 0.02 ng/mL (normal range: 0.00-0.04 ng/mL)
* Lactic acid: 1.3 mmol/L (normal range: 0.5-2.0 mmol/L)

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CT scan: bibasilar airspace opacities
* Chest X-ray: bibasilar airspace opacities

The patient's diagnosis is massive pulmonary embolism (PE) with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, which has improved after lysis.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Re-embolization of the pulmonary arteries
* Pulmonary hypertension
* Right ventricular failure
* Respiratory failure
* Sepsis
* Meningitis
* Stroke
* Cardiac arrhythmias

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing heparin therapy
* Holding off on coumadin therapy in case of re-embolization
* Moving to extubate the patient today
* Limited work-up of hypercoagulability as an outpatient
* Monitoring for bleeding and transfusing prn
* Controlling blood pressure and central venous pressure
* Managing fever and infection
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis
* Continuing stress dose steroids for Crohn's disease
* Monitoring for signs of Crohn's disease flares
* Managing diabetes mellitus
* Monitoring for signs of hyperglycemia
* Continuing prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease who presents with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE), resulting in hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has undergone lysis of the PE, which has improved his hemodynamics and gas exchange.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Recurrent PE: Given the patient's history of Crohn's disease, which is a known risk factor for venous thromboembolism, there is a risk of recurrent PE.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further hypoxia and hypercarbia.
3. Bleeding: The patient's rectal bleeding may worsen if not properly managed, leading to hypovolemic shock and further complications.
4. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to Crohn's disease and the use of immunosuppressive medications may increase his risk of infection.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may be indicative of underlying cardiovascular disease, which may worsen if not properly managed.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and inability to assess his neurological status may indicate a risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's Crohn's disease may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as perforation or obstruction, if not properly managed.
8. Renal complications: The patient's increased lactate levels may indicate underlying kidney dysfunction, which may worsen if not properly managed.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue systemic anticoagulation with heparin to prevent recurrent PE.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust his ventilator settings as necessary to prevent further respiratory failure.
3. Manage the patient's rectal bleeding with stress dose steroids and mesalamine, and monitor his hemoglobin levels closely to ensure adequate transfusion.
4. Continue immunosuppressive medications to manage the patient's Crohn's disease, and monitor his immunosuppressed state closely to prevent infection.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely and adjust his medication regimen as necessary to prevent further cardiovascular complications.
6. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and adjust his sedation regimen as necessary to prevent further neurological complications.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely and adjust his medication regimen as necessary to prevent further gastrointestinal complications.
8. Monitor the patient's renal status closely and adjust his fluid management regimen as necessary to prevent further renal complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7589**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient has massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen) upon
   presentation.  Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT
   chest, and EKG.  Tropononin mildly elevated and BNP is markedly
   elevated.  Given recent GI bleeding due to crohn's disease, concern for
   use of TPA would be GI bleed and intracranial hemorrhage.  Patient is
   s/p 140 mg SC of lovenox at OSH and now s/p lysis with marked
   improvement of respiratory status.
   - heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100
   - PS support trial with plan to extubate later today
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   - type and cross 6 units of PRBCs
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and [**Known lastname 5607**].
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - [**Last Name (LF) 5607**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] consider long acting insulin if improved
   .
   Crohns.  Patient has recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Most recent
   colonoscopy in [**5-2**] showed significant colonic inflammation.  He was
   observed in the MICU for GI bleed, but did not requiring blood
   transfusiosn.  He was put on prednisone taper at discharge.  Recently
   had worsening of symptoms with steroid taper so had to go up on
   prednisone dose from 15 to 17 last week.  Now with marroon colored
   stool in setting of s/p lysis and being on heparin drip.
   - stress dose steroids given that patient is on chronic steroids and is
   now critically ill; additionally, this might offer colonic protection
   in the setting of heparin bolus/drip and s/p tpa
   - type and crossed for 6 units
   - q 4-6 hour hcts
   .
   .
   Hypotension.  Likely related to massive PE.  Low CVPs suggest
   hypovelmia as well.
   - hold antihypertensives
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   .
   Renal failure.  Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow Cr
   .
   Leukocytosis.  Likely related to chronic steroid use.  No clear sign of
   infection.
   - monitor wbc, fever curve
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7589**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient has massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen) upon
   presentation.  Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT
   chest, and EKG.  Tropononin mildly elevated and BNP is markedly
   elevated.  Given recent GI bleeding due to crohn's disease, concern for
   use of TPA would be GI bleed and intracranial hemorrhage.  Patient is
   s/p 140 mg SC of lovenox at OSH and now s/p lysis with marked
   improvement of respiratory status.
   - heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100
   - PS support trial with plan to extubate later today
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   - type and cross 6 units of PRBCs
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and [**Known lastname 5607**].
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - [**Last Name (LF) 5607**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] consider long acting insulin if improved
   .
   Crohns.  Patient has recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Most recent
   colonoscopy in [**5-2**] showed significant colonic inflammation.  He was
   observed in the MICU for GI bleed, but did not requiring blood
   transfusiosn.  He was put on prednisone taper at discharge.  Recently
   had worsening of symptoms with steroid taper so had to go up on
   prednisone dose from 15 to 17 last week.  Now with marroon colored
   stool in setting of s/p lysis and being on heparin drip.
   - stress dose steroids given that patient is on chronic steroids and is
   now critically ill; additionally, this might offer colonic protection
   in the setting of heparin bolus/drip and s/p tpa
   - type and crossed for 6 units
   - q 4-6 hour hcts
   .
   .
   Hypotension.  Likely related to massive PE.  Low CVPs suggest
   hypovelmia as well.
   - hold antihypertensives
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   .
   Renal failure.  Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow Cr
   .
   Leukocytosis.  Likely related to chronic steroid use.  No clear sign of
   infection.
   - monitor wbc, fever curve
   .

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current status as follows:

The patient is a 56-year-old male admitted with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure requiring intubation. He has a history of diabetes, hypertension, Crohn's disease, and is on steroids. He has undergone lysis of the PE and has shown marked improvement in respiratory status.

The patient's current vital signs include:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.1°F)
* Heart rate: 88 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 159/89 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 17.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 10.8 g/dL
* Platelet count: 267 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.05 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.3 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.3 g/dL
* LDH: 252 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.4 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Pulmonary embolism
* Type 2 diabetes
* Crohn's disease
* Hypertension

The patient's current medications include:

* Heparin sodium
* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Morphine sulfate
* Metformin
* Azithromycin

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current status include:

* Bleeding complications due to heparin therapy and recent GI bleeding
* Infection, particularly respiratory or urinary tract infection, given the patient's recent history of GI bleeding and immunosuppressive therapy
* Hypotension and hypovolemia due to massive PE and potential bleeding
* Renal failure, given the patient's recent creatinine levels and potential nephrotoxicity from medications
* Leukocytosis, potentially related to chronic steroid use
* Hyperglycemia, given the patient's history of type 2 diabetes and potential insulin resistance from steroids
* Stress ulceration, given the patient's critical illness and potential for bleeding
* Venous thromboembolism, particularly deep vein thrombosis, given the patient's recent PE and potential for further clot formation

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100
* PS support trial with plan to extubate later today
* IVF boluses for low CVP
* Type and cross 6 units of PRBCs
* Stress dose steroids given the patient's chronic steroid use and critical illness
* Renally dose all medications
* Monitor WBC and fever curve
* Follow creatinine levels
* Consider long-acting insulin for glucose control"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7589**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient has massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen) upon
   presentation.  Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT
   chest, and EKG.  Tropononin mildly elevated and BNP is markedly
   elevated.  Given recent GI bleeding due to crohn's disease, concern for
   use of TPA would be GI bleed and intracranial hemorrhage.  Patient is
   s/p 140 mg SC of lovenox at OSH and now s/p lysis with marked
   improvement of respiratory status.
   - heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100
   - PS support trial with plan to extubate later today
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   - type and cross 6 units of PRBCs
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and [**Known lastname 5607**].
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - [**Last Name (LF) 5607**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] consider long acting insulin if improved
   .
   Crohns.  Patient has recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Most recent
   colonoscopy in [**5-2**] showed significant colonic inflammation.  He was
   observed in the MICU for GI bleed, but did not requiring blood
   transfusiosn.  He was put on prednisone taper at discharge.  Recently
   had worsening of symptoms with steroid taper so had to go up on
   prednisone dose from 15 to 17 last week.  Now with marroon colored
   stool in setting of s/p lysis and being on heparin drip.
   - stress dose steroids given that patient is on chronic steroids and is
   now critically ill; additionally, this might offer colonic protection
   in the setting of heparin bolus/drip and s/p tpa
   - type and crossed for 6 units
   - q 4-6 hour hcts
   .
   .
   Hypotension.  Likely related to massive PE.  Low CVPs suggest
   hypovelmia as well.
   - hold antihypertensives
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   .
   Renal failure.  Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow Cr
   .
   Leukocytosis.  Likely related to chronic steroid use.  No clear sign of
   infection.
   - monitor wbc, fever curve

Summary:

The patient, a 56-year-old male with diabetes, hypertension, and Crohn's disease, was admitted to the ICU with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure requiring intubation. He was treated with heparin drip and lytic therapy, which led to significant improvement in his respiratory status. The patient is still experiencing bloody stools and has a history of GI bleeding due to Crohn's disease. He is also at risk for GI bleed and intracranial hemorrhage due to the use of TPA.

The patient's current medications include heparin, pantoprazole, and morphine sulfate. He has a history of type 2 diabetes and is at risk for hyperglycemia due to steroid use. His recent laboratory results show leukocytosis, likely related to chronic steroid use, and mild elevation of troponin and BNP.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 159/89 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 96% on nasal cannula at 40% FiO2.

Potential medical complications:

1. GI bleed: The patient's history of GI bleeding due to Crohn's disease and the use of TPA make him at risk for further bleeding.
2. Intracranial hemorrhage: The patient's use of TPA and the risk of bleeding in the setting of Crohn's disease and steroid use make him at risk for intracranial hemorrhage.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's history of type 2 diabetes and the use of steroids make him at risk for hyperglycemia.
4. Renal failure: The patient's current creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL and his history of hypertension and diabetes make him at risk for renal failure.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be related to chronic steroid use, but it could also be a sign of infection.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and his current need for ventilatory support make him at risk for further respiratory complications.
7. DVT: The patient's history of PE and his current use of heparin make him at risk for DVT.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's plan includes:

1. Continue heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100.
2. Trial of PS support with plan to extubate later today.
3. IVF boluses for low CVP.
4. Type and cross 6 units of PRBCs.
5. Stress dose steroids given the patient's chronic steroid use and critical illness.
6. Monitor WBC and fever curve.
7. Renally dose all medications.
8. Follow creatinine levels.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is unknown at this time."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7589**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient had massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen) upon
   presentation.  Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT
   chest, and EKG.  Tropononin mildly elevated and BNP is markedly
   elevated.  s/p lysis.  Now extubated and much improved.
   - cont heparin gtt for now
   - do not start coumadin for now until GI issues resolved
   - LENIs to evaluate if large clot burden remains (in case
   anticoagulation needs to be stopped emergently in a setting of a GI
   bleed in the future)
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and [**Known lastname 5607**].
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - [**Last Name (LF) 5607**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] consider long acting insulin if improved
   .
   Crohns.  Patient has recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Most recent
   colonoscopy in [**5-2**] showed significant colonic inflammation.  He was
   observed in the MICU for GI bleed, but did not requiring blood
   transfusiosn.  He was put on prednisone taper at discharge.  Recently
   had worsening of symptoms with steroid taper so had to go up on
   prednisone dose from 15 to 17 last week.  Now with marroon colored
   stool in setting of s/p lysis and being on heparin drip.
   - stress dose steroids given that patient is on chronic steroids and is
   now critically ill; additionally, this might offer colonic protection
   in the setting of heparin bolus/drip and s/p tpa, will consult GI for
   help managing Crohn
s flare
   - if no contraindication, will decrease to pre-hospitalization steroid
   dose
   - type and crossed for 6 units
   - q 4-6 hour hcts
   - hct
s stable so far, but still having maroon stools
   .
   Hypotension.  Likely related to massive PE.  Low CVPs suggest
   hypovelmia as well.
   - hold antihypertensives
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   .
   Renal failure.  Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow Cr, trending down
   .
   Leukocytosis.  Likely related to chronic steroid use.  No clear sign of
   infection.
   - monitor wbc, fever curve
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7589**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient had massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen) upon
   presentation.  Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT
   chest, and EKG.  Tropononin mildly elevated and BNP is markedly
   elevated.  s/p lysis.  Now extubated and much improved.
   - cont heparin gtt for now
   - do not start coumadin for now until GI issues resolved
   - LENIs to evaluate if large clot burden remains (in case
   anticoagulation needs to be stopped emergently in a setting of a GI
   bleed in the future)
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and [**Known lastname 5607**].
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - [**Last Name (LF) 5607**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] consider long acting insulin if improved
   .
   Crohns.  Patient has recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Most recent
   colonoscopy in [**5-2**] showed significant colonic inflammation.  He was
   observed in the MICU for GI bleed, but did not requiring blood
   transfusiosn.  He was put on prednisone taper at discharge.  Recently
   had worsening of symptoms with steroid taper so had to go up on
   prednisone dose from 15 to 17 last week.  Now with marroon colored
   stool in setting of s/p lysis and being on heparin drip.
   - stress dose steroids given that patient is on chronic steroids and is
   now critically ill; additionally, this might offer colonic protection
   in the setting of heparin bolus/drip and s/p tpa, will consult GI for
   help managing Crohn
s flare
   - if no contraindication, will decrease to pre-hospitalization steroid
   dose
   - type and crossed for 6 units
   - q 4-6 hour hcts
   - hct
s stable so far, but still having maroon stools
   .
   Hypotension.  Likely related to massive PE.  Low CVPs suggest
   hypovelmia as well.
   - hold antihypertensives
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   .
   Renal failure.  Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow Cr, trending down
   .
   Leukocytosis.  Likely related to chronic steroid use.  No clear sign of
   infection.
   - monitor wbc, fever curve

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, Crohn's disease, and steroid use. He was admitted with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient had a massive clot burden on computed tomography (CT) with significant hypoxia (PAO2 of 130s in spite of 100% oxygen) upon presentation. He has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT chest, and electrocardiogram (EKG). The patient's troponin level is mildly elevated, and his brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is markedly elevated.

The patient underwent lytic therapy and was extubated. He is currently on heparin drip and is being monitored for bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin level is stable, but he is still experiencing bloody stools.

The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and is at risk for developing hyperglycemia due to steroid use. He is currently on glargine and will likely require long-acting insulin.

The patient has a recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease and has had worsening symptoms with steroid taper. He is currently on prednisone and is at risk for a flare-up.

The patient has hypotension likely related to massive PE and low central venous pressure (CVP) suggesting hypovolemia. He is being managed with IV fluids and antihypertensives are being held.

The patient has renal failure, but his current creatinine level is within his range of normal. He is being monitored for changes in his creatinine level.

The patient has leukocytosis likely related to chronic steroid use, but there is no clear sign of infection. He is being monitored for changes in his white blood cell count and fever curve.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to his heparin drip and recent lytic therapy.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient is at risk for developing hyperglycemia due to steroid use and his history of type 2 diabetes.
3. Crohn's disease flare-up: The patient is at risk for a flare-up of his Crohn's disease due to steroid taper and recent lytic therapy.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is being monitored, and he is at risk for further decline in his renal function.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of infection, and he is at risk for developing sepsis.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if his CVP remains low, and he may require further management with IV fluids and vasopressors.
7. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's massive PE may lead to further complications, such as right heart failure and respiratory failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7589**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient had massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen) upon
   presentation.  Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT
   chest, and EKG.  Tropononin mildly elevated and BNP is markedly
   elevated.  s/p lysis.  Now extubated and much improved.
   - cont heparin gtt for now
   - do not start coumadin for now until GI issues resolved
   - LENIs to evaluate if large clot burden remains (in case
   anticoagulation needs to be stopped emergently in a setting of a GI
   bleed in the future)
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and [**Known lastname 5607**].
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - [**Last Name (LF) 5607**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] consider long acting insulin if improved
   .
   Crohns.  Patient has recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Most recent
   colonoscopy in [**5-2**] showed significant colonic inflammation.  He was
   observed in the MICU for GI bleed, but did not requiring blood
   transfusiosn.  He was put on prednisone taper at discharge.  Recently
   had worsening of symptoms with steroid taper so had to go up on
   prednisone dose from 15 to 17 last week.  Now with marroon colored
   stool in setting of s/p lysis and being on heparin drip.
   - stress dose steroids given that patient is on chronic steroids and is
   now critically ill; additionally, this might offer colonic protection
   in the setting of heparin bolus/drip and s/p tpa
   - type and crossed for 6 units
   - q 4-6 hour hcts
   .
   .
   Hypotension.  Likely related to massive PE.  Low CVPs suggest
   hypovelmia as well.
   - hold antihypertensives
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   .
   Renal failure.  Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male admitted to the ICU with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, Crohn's disease, and chronic steroid use.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a reduction in sedation and ventilation. He is extubated and showing improvement. However, he is still experiencing bloody stools, which is a concern.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure of 159/89 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and his temperature is 36.9°C.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.1, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 267. His creatinine is 1.3 mg/dL, and his troponin is mildly elevated. His blood glucose is 292 mg/dL, and his lactate acid is 1.3 mmol/L.

The patient's medications include heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and morphine sulfate. He is also receiving a stress dose of steroids due to his chronic steroid use.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. GI bleeding: The patient's bloody stools and recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease increase the risk of GI bleeding.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's recent PE and continued use of heparin sodium increase the risk of further embolism.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.3 mg/dL, which is within his range of normal. However, his recent Cr levels have ranged from 1.3 to 2.0, suggesting a potential for renal failure.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be related to his chronic steroid use. This could increase the risk of infection.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 159/89 mmHg, which is slightly elevated. His low central venous pressure (CVP) suggests hypovolemia, which may contribute to his hypotension.

In conclusion, the patient is stable but at risk for several medical complications. Close monitoring and management of his medications, laboratory results, and vital signs are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with Crohn's disease who presented with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) after lytic therapy. He was extubated and is currently receiving heparin infusion. His hemoglobin (Hct) is stable, and he is experiencing bloody stools. He has a history of allergies to azithromycin and metformin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, and blood pressure of 159/87 mmHg. His respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula and standby ventilator mode. His physical examination is notable for tender minimal RUQ abdominal tenderness and absent radial and digital pulses.

Lab results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.2 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 17.1 K/uL
* Platelet count: 267 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.05 ng/mL
* Glucose: 292 mg/dL

The patient is receiving a range of medications, including heparin, pantoprazole, morphine, mesalamine, hydrocort, nac, docusate, and metformin.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy and potential gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Thrombocytopenia and bleeding complications due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
3. Respiratory failure due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and potential underlying respiratory disease.
4. Cardiovascular complications due to pulmonary embolism and potential underlying cardiovascular disease.
5. Infection complications due to prolonged hospitalization and potential underlying immunosuppression.
6. Nutritional deficiencies due to prolonged hospitalization and potential underlying gastrointestinal disease.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding complications due to Crohn's disease and potential underlying gastrointestinal disease.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's bleeding complications and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
2. Monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent thrombocytopenia.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent cardiovascular complications.
5. Monitor the patient's infection status and adjust antibiotic therapy as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust diet as necessary.
7. Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist to optimize Crohn's disease management in the setting of anticoagulation therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with Crohn's disease who presented with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) after lytic therapy. He was extubated and is currently receiving heparin infusion. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 159/87 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 90% on nasal cannula. He is receiving respiratory support with a standby ventilator mode and 40% FiO2.

Physical examination reveals an overweight/obese patient with a normal head, ears, nose, and throat exam. Cardiovascular examination is normal, with a normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. Respiratory examination shows symmetric expansion and clear breath sounds. Abdominal examination is soft and tender to minimal RUQ. Neurologic examination is normal, with the patient oriented and able to follow simple commands.

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 267 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 17.1 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 24 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.4 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.3 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.3 g/dL
* LDH: 252 IU/L

Radiology results show:

* Chest X-ray: Bases not visualized

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is critically ill with a massive PE, s/p lysis, and is receiving heparin infusion. He is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to his Crohn's disease and anticoagulation therapy. The plan is to continue heparin infusion, hold off on coumadin for now, and monitor for GIB. The patient will be discussed with the GI team regarding optimal Crohn's regimen in the setting of necessary anticoagulation. Prednisone and mesalamine will be started for now.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient is at risk for GIB due to his Crohn's disease and anticoagulation therapy. Close monitoring of his stool output and hemoglobin levels is necessary.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE) recurrence: The patient has already had a massive PE, and he is still receiving anticoagulation therapy. Close monitoring of his pulmonary function and oxygen saturation is necessary.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his immunosuppressed state and anticoagulation therapy. Close monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory results is necessary.
4. Septic shock: The patient is at risk for septic shock due to his immunosuppressed state and anticoagulation therapy. Close monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory results is necessary.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and anticoagulation therapy. Close monitoring of his respiratory function and oxygen saturation is necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, Crohn's disease, and steroid use, was admitted with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and underwent lysis. He is currently hemodynamically stable and extubated, but experiencing ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) presumably due to Crohn's disease. The patient has a residual clot burden in his right lower extremity (RLE) as shown on lower extremity venous Doppler imaging (LENI).

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin (Hb) levels decreasing from 33.9 to 27.6% over the past 24 hours
* Platelet count (Plt) within normal range
* Creatinine (Cr) levels within normal range
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr) levels within normal range
* Electrolyte levels within normal range

The patient is receiving heparin infusion for anticoagulation and is being monitored for any signs of bleeding.

Potential medical complications:

1. Continued GI bleeding: The patient's ongoing GI bleeding may lead to further hemodynamic instability, anemia, and potential need for transfusions.
2. Thrombotic complications: The patient's residual clot burden in the RLE may lead to further thrombotic events, such as deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's steroid use and type 2 diabetes may lead to hyperglycemia, which may require adjustments to his insulin regimen.
4. Renal failure: The patient's Cr levels may continue to increase, potentially leading to renal failure, which may require adjustments to his medication regimen and potential need for dialysis.
5. Infection: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and use of invasive devices may increase his risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).

Assessment and plan:

1. Continue heparin infusion for anticoagulation.
2. Monitor the patient's GI bleeding and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's Hb levels and transfuse as necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's Cr levels and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.
5. Consider long-acting insulin to improve glycemic control.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status.
8. Consider prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infections.
9. Consider adjusting the patient's code status to do not resuscitate (DNR) if he is experiencing a poor prognosis."

   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient had massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen) upon
   presentation.  Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT
   chest, and EKG.  Tropononin mildly elevated and BNP is markedly
   elevated.  s/p lysis.  Now extubated and much improved.
   - cont heparin gtt for now
   - do not start coumadin for now until GI issues resolved
   - LENIs to evaluate if large clot burden remains (in case
   anticoagulation needs to be stopped emergently in a setting of a GI
   bleed in the future)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, Crohn's disease, and on steroids, who was admitted with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient had a massive clot burden on computed tomography angiography (CTA) with significant hypoxia upon presentation. He had evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram, CT chest, and electrocardiogram (EKG). Troponin was mildly elevated, and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was markedly elevated.

The patient has been extubated and is much improved. However, he is still experiencing maroon-colored stools, which is a concern. He has been diagnosed with Crohn's disease and has been on a steroid taper. The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated, and he is at risk of developing hyperglycemia due to the steroid use.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure of 155/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 11 mmHg, and his fluid balance is stable.

The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary embolism, which is a potential complication of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). He has also been diagnosed with Crohn's disease, which is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and he is at risk of developing hyperglycemia.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, which is likely related to chronic steroid use. His liver function tests (LFTs) are normal, and his renal function is stable. His electrocardiogram (EKG) shows evidence of right heart strain.

The patient's treatment plan includes anticoagulation therapy with heparin, which is being continued for now. The patient's steroids will be tapered, and he will be monitored for signs of hyperglycemia. The patient will also receive stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk of developing recurrent pulmonary embolism due to the presence of DVT.
2. Deep venous thrombosis: The patient has been diagnosed with DVT, which is a potential complication of pulmonary embolism.
3. Crohn's disease flare: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease, which is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. He is at risk of developing a flare-up of his disease.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient is at risk of developing hyperglycemia due to the steroid use.
5. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is stable, but he is at risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the presence of DVT and pulmonary embolism.
6. Infection: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which is a potential sign of infection.
7. Right heart failure: The patient has evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram, CT chest, and EKG, which is a potential complication of pulmonary embolism.

In conclusion, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, Crohn's disease, and on steroids, who was admitted with submassive pulmonary embolism and respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with DVT, Crohn's disease, and is at risk of developing recurrent pulmonary embolism, hyperglycemia, and right heart failure. He will require close monitoring and management to prevent these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) case, with ongoing maroon bowel movements, and stable hematocrit (Hct). The patient has a history of allergies to azithromycin and metformin, and is receiving heparin sodium, pantoprazole, morphine sulfate, and other medications. The patient has undergone an upper endoscopy and has been diagnosed with non-occlusive thrombosis of the right popliteal vein. The patient is also experiencing some pain near the arm where the blood pressure cuff caused irritation.

Potential medical complications:

1. GI bleeding: The patient's ongoing maroon bowel movements indicate ongoing bleeding, which may lead to hypovolemic shock, anemia, and potential bleeding complications.
2. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and decreased urine output indicate potential acute kidney injury (AKI), which may lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and require dialysis.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory depression.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's ongoing PE may lead to further respiratory and cardiovascular complications, including respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and potentially death.
5. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT): The patient's non-occlusive thrombosis of the right popliteal vein may lead to further DVTs in other extremities, potentially causing pulmonary embolism, post-thrombotic syndrome, and chronic pain.
6. Infection: The patient's fever of unknown origin (FUO) may indicate an underlying infection, which may lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and potentially death.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may mask the symptoms of stress ulcer, potentially leading to bleeding complications and gastrointestinal perforation.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who presented with respiratory failure due to a massive pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient underwent lysis with rapid improvement, but now has a slow gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) likely due to inflamed colon.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* Heart rate: 103 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 153/88 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* General appearance: Not well-nourished, not in acute distress, overweight/obese
* Cardiovascular: Normal pulse, normal blood pressure
* Respiratory: Clear breath sounds, symmetric expansion
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present, not distended
* Extremities: Right and left radial pulses present, no cyanosis or clubbing
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to stimuli

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 240 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 10.8 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 26 mg/dL
* Sodium: 147 mmol/L
* Potassium: 4.6 mmol/L
* Glucose: 203 mg/dL
* Albumin: 3.3 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.3 mmol/L

The patient has a slow GIB, likely due to inflamed colon, and is being treated with:

* Therapeutic heparin
* Holding off on coumadin due to persistent GIB
* Holding off on filter despite non-occlusive clot
* Tidal Hct
* Good access
* Continue prednisone, increase to 40 daily
* New pentasa-like medication per GI
* PPI daily

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue therapeutic heparin
* Hold off on coumadin and filter
* Increase prednisone to 40 daily
* Start new pentasa-like medication
* Continue PPI daily
* Restart diet
* Glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued bleeding from the GIB
* Development of sepsis due to ongoing inflammation and potential infection
* Kidney injury or failure due to dehydration and potential hypotension
* Respiratory failure due to continued inflammation and potential pneumonia
* Cardiovascular complications due to ongoing inflammation and potential cardiac issues

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who presented with massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and subsequent respiratory failure, which has resolved after lysis. However, the patient is now experiencing a slow gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) likely due to inflammation in the colon.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, and blood pressure of 153/88 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 99% on nasal cannula oxygen. The patient's abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present.

Laboratory results show a decline in hemoglobin (Hb) levels from 9.1 g/dL to 7.6 g/dL, indicating ongoing bleeding. The patient's platelet count is 240,000/μL, and the international normalized ratio (INR) is 1.1. The patient's creatinine (Cr) level is 1.1 mg/dL, and the lactate level is 1.3 mmol/L.

The patient's medical history includes a recent diagnosis of IBD, and the patient is taking medications such as prednisone, pantoprazole, and heparin. The patient's allergies include azithromycin and metformin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's ongoing GIB is a concern, and further bleeding can lead to hypovolemic shock, anemia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is declining, which can increase the risk of bleeding and thrombotic complications.
3. Renal impairment: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which can indicate kidney damage or impairment.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is elevated, which can increase the risk of diabetic complications.
5. Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised due to IBD and corticosteroid therapy, which can increase the risk of infection.

In conclusion, the patient requires close monitoring and management to address the ongoing GIB, thrombocytopenia, and potential renal impairment. The patient's medications should be adjusted accordingly, and further laboratory tests should be performed to monitor the patient's condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease, admitted one week ago for a massive pulmonary embolism treated with thrombolysis. He has been passing maroon stool with bowel movements, indicating ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. He is receiving heparin therapy due to the severity of the pulmonary embolism, and his PTT will be closely monitored. A colonoscopy is planned for tomorrow.

The patient has ongoing anemia, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and pulmonary embolism. He is receiving transfusions for his anemia and has been maintained on prednisone for his inflammatory bowel disease.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient is experiencing ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which is being managed with transfusions and heparin therapy.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is improving, and he is being maintained on adequate volume status.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's electrolyte levels are acceptable, and his acid-base status is being closely monitored.
4. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin, and his PTT will be closely monitored.
5. Crohn's Colitis: The patient is being maintained on prednisone for his inflammatory bowel disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to further complications, such as hypovolemic shock or organ failure.
2. Renal failure progression: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to end-stage renal disease.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest if not managed properly.
4. Pulmonary embolism complications: The patient's pulmonary embolism may lead to further complications, such as pulmonary hypertension or right heart failure.
5. Inflammatory bowel disease flares: The patient's Crohn's colitis may flare up, leading to further gastrointestinal complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and adjust therapy as necessary.
2. Maintain the patient's renal function and adjust fluid and electrolyte management accordingly.
3. Continue anticoagulation therapy with heparin and closely monitor the patient's PTT.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and acid-base status closely.
5. Consider colonoscopy to evaluate the severity of the gastrointestinal bleeding and plan for further management."

   PE. Trasnferred to floor yesterday night s/p lysis now with continued
   maroon stools and falling HCT.
   # acute blood loss anemia- Likely secondary to TPA lysis, heparin gtt
   and/or Crohns. Pt with maroon stool since anticoagulation started.
   However, pt with HCT drop overnight from 30 to 26, bumped to 30.4 after
   2 units. Pt reportedly asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable. Gen
   [**Doctor First Name **] aware and recommended filter. GI aware and plan to scope after
   prep tomorrow.
   -active T+S, crossmatch 6 units
   -Q4h HCTs, transfuse for <30
   -f/u GI recs

   -stop heparin gtt prior to scope.
   -2 PIVs and CVL
   # Pulmonary Embolism. Patient had massive clot burden visible by CTA,
   and s/p right ventricular strain on echo. S/p lysis and now
   hemodynamics are stable. S/p extubation and with good oxygen saturation
   weaned to RA.
   - continue heparin gtt for now, will consider coumadin once bleeding
   resolved. Will need lifelong anticoag.
   - monitor resp status
   # Crohns. Prior to admission, patient was on PO prednisone taper.
   Following administration of tpa lysis for PE, patient has developed
   ongoing maroon stools. Hct has fallen from 40 to 30. Hemodynamically
   stable and asx. EGD shows no upper GI bleeding. S/p colonoscopy in [**5-2**]
   showing inflammation of the colon.
   - per GI, increased prednisone to 40mg daily
   - Mesalamine 500 mg PO BID
   - cont to monitor Q4hr hcts and transfuse for <30
   # Type 2 Diabetes: Hyperglycemia given steroid use.
   - HISS tightened, added glargine 10units QHS
   - monitor glucose levels closeley
   # HTN. Normotensive-will continue to hold home anti-HTNs given GIB.
   # Renal failure. Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best.

   # Crohns. Prior to admission, patient was on PO prednisone taper.
   Following administration of tpa lysis for PE, patient has developed
   ongoing maroon stools. Hct has fallen from 40 to 30. Hemodynamically
   stable and asx. EGD shows no upper GI bleeding. S/p colonoscopy in [**5-2**]
   showing inflammation of the colon.
   - per GI, increased prednisone to 40mg daily
   - Mesalamine 500 mg PO BID
   - cont to monitor Q4hr hcts and transfuse for <30
   # Type 2 Diabetes: Hyperglycemia given steroid use.
   - HISS tightened, added glargine 10units QHS

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a complex medical history, including DMII, HTN, Crohn's disease, and diverticulosis, who was admitted to the MICU on [**7-29**] for respiratory failure requiring intubation secondary to submassive PE. He underwent TPA lysis and was transferred to the floor yesterday night. However, he has continued to have maroon stools and his HCT has fallen. The patient has ongoing respiratory failure, with an SpO2 of 96% on RA. His physical examination is significant for multiple eschars, no edema, and a CTA of the lungs bilaterally.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Blood Loss Anemia: The patient's HCT has dropped significantly, and he is at risk for further bleeding due to his Crohn's disease and ongoing maroon stools. He requires close monitoring and transfusion for <30.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient had a massive clot burden visible by CTA, and he underwent lysis. He is at risk for further clotting and requires continued anticoagulation.
3. Crohn's Disease: The patient's Crohn's disease is flaring, and he is at risk for further complications, including bleeding, perforation, and stricture formation.
4. Type 2 Diabetes: The patient's hyperglycemia is likely due to steroid use, and he requires close monitoring and tight glycemic control.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's recent Cr levels have ranged from 1.3 to 2.0, and he requires close monitoring of his renal function.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has ongoing maroon stools, and he is at risk for further bleeding.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his immunocompromised state and the presence of multiple lines.
8. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ongoing respiratory failure, and he requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent further complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's HCT and transfuse for <30.
2. Continue anticoagulation therapy to prevent further clotting.
3. Increase prednisone to 40mg daily to control Crohn's disease.
4. Monitor the patient's glucose levels closely and adjust his insulin regimen as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his treatment plan as necessary.
7. Consider placement of an IVC filter to prevent further clotting.
8. Monitor the patient's stool output and adjust his bowel regimen as necessary.
9. Consider colonoscopy to evaluate the patient's colon and rule out any further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a complex medical history, including diabetes, hypertension, Crohn's disease, and prior colectomy. He was admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure requiring intubation secondary to submassive pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient has been receiving anticoagulation therapy, which has led to ongoing maroon stools and falling hemoglobin (HCT) levels. He has also developed hyperglycemia, which is being managed with insulin therapy. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 63 beats per minute, blood pressure of 127/86 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient has undergone several procedures, including colonoscopy and lysis of the PE. He has also received transfusions of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and has been treated with heparin and prednisone.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and liver enzymes. His kidney function is within normal range.

The patient's current medical condition is complicated by several factors, including:

1. GI bleed: The patient has ongoing maroon stools and falling HCT levels, which may be secondary to TPA lysis, heparin gtt, and/or Crohn's disease.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of massive clot burden and right ventricular strain on echo. He has undergone lysis and is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy.
3. Crohn's disease: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease and is currently experiencing ongoing maroon stools and inflammation of the colon.
4. Type 2 diabetes: The patient has hyperglycemia, which is being managed with insulin therapy.
5. Renal failure: The patient's recent creatinine levels have ranged from 1.3 to 2.0 mg/dL, which is within his normal range.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Further GI bleeding: The patient's ongoing maroon stools and falling HCT levels may lead to further bleeding complications.
2. Pulmonary embolism recurrence: The patient's history of massive clot burden and right ventricular strain on echo may increase his risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism.
3. Crohn's disease exacerbation: The patient's ongoing maroon stools and inflammation of the colon may exacerbate his Crohn's disease.
4. Renal failure progression: The patient's current creatinine levels may progress to more severe renal failure if not managed properly.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state may increase his risk of infection.

Based on the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent further complications and ensure optimal management of his condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease who presented with dyspnea and was diagnosed with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) following lysis. He is currently experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and is awaiting further diagnostic procedures. The patient has a history of allergies to azithromycin and metformin, and is taking several medications, including heparin, protonix, prednisone, and lantus.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, and blood pressure of 124/84 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 99%. His respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). His coagulation studies are abnormal, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.1 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 80.4 seconds.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient is experiencing bleeding from an unknown source, which may be related to his Crohn's disease or the massive PE.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of PE, which may have caused his respiratory distress and hypoxemia.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) due to his massive PE and dehydration.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has elevated potassium levels, which may be related to his kidney failure and medication use.
5. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has a temperature of 36.9°C, which may be related to his underlying medical condition or a secondary infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate the presence of an infection, which can lead to sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and his heart rate and blood pressure are elevated, which may increase his risk of cardiac arrest.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's GIB may worsen, leading to hemorrhagic shock or other bleeding complications.
5. Renal failure progression: The patient's kidney failure may worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease who presented with dyspnea and was diagnosed with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) after lysis. The patient is now experiencing expected gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and is awaiting further diagnostic procedures.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 79 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 124/84 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 99%. He is receiving heparin infusions and has a central line in place.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.0 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 8.2-9.5 K/uL
* Platelet count: 261-309 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.0-1.1 mg/dL
* Glucose: 126-383 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Potassium: 3.3-4.5 mEq/L, magnesium: 1.9-2.5 mg/dL, phosphorus: 3.8-4.5 mg/dL
* Liver function tests: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 13-15 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 13-15 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase: 45-55 IU/L
* Coagulation studies: Prothrombin time (PT): 13.4 seconds, partial thromboplastin time (PTT): 80.4 seconds, international normalized ratio (INR): 1.1

The patient's imaging studies show no new findings.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB)
* Fever of unknown origin (FUO)
* Acute renal failure (ARF)
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium)
* Pulmonary embolism (PE)

The plan is to:

* Perform a repeat colonoscopy to evaluate the source of bleeding
* Continue prednisone and mesalamine therapy
* Monitor for residual clot in the pulmonary arteries
* Consider starting coumadin therapy once the bleeding has resolved
* Consider placing an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter or performing surgery to address the source of bleeding

The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management in the intensive care unit (ICU)."

   Chief Complaint: 56 year old male with DMII, HTN, crohn's disease, on
   steroids, diverticulosis s/p colectomy X 2, who was admitted to the
   MICU on [**7-29**] for respiratory failure requiring intubation secondary to
   submassive PE. Transferred to floor yesterday night s/p lysis now with
   continued maroon stools and falling HCT.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Colonoscopy this morning showed active Crohn's disease but no
   evidence of current bleeding.  GI recommended IVC filter and continued
   systemic anticoagulation.
   -Colonoscopy:
   Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
   Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
   Ulceration and erythema from the transverse colon to cecum compatible
   with Crohn's disease
   Blood clots in the whole colon.  In the terminal ileum, we found normal
   mucosa.  No blood clot and red blood were noticed in the terminal
   ileum.  The stool in the terminal ileum was yellow.  The G.I. bleeding,
   therefore, most likely occurred in the colon.
   Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
   - IVC filter  by IR in am

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   24 Hour Events:
   - Colonoscopy this morning showed active Crohn's disease but no
   evidence of current bleeding.  GI recommended IVC filter and continued
   systemic anticoagulation.
   -Colonoscopy:
   Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
   Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with DMII, HTN, Crohn's disease, on steroids, and diverticulosis s/p colectomy x2, admitted to the MICU on [**7-29**] for respiratory failure requiring intubation secondary to submassive PE. He was transferred to the floor yesterday night s/p lysis, with continued maroon stools and falling HCT. The patient has ongoing maroon stools, likely secondary to TPA lysis, heparin gtt, and/or Crohn's disease. His HCT has fallen from 40 to 30, and he is hemodynamically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient has ongoing maroon stools, which may indicate continued bleeding. This could lead to hypovolemic shock, anemia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient had a submassive PE and was treated with TPA lysis. However, there is a risk of recurrent PE, especially given his active Crohn's disease.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's recent Cr levels have ranged from 1.3 to 2.0, which may indicate underlying kidney damage. Continued use of nephrotoxic medications, such as heparin, may exacerbate this issue.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly given his immunocompromised state due to Crohn's disease and steroid use.
5. Malnutrition: The patient is NPO, which may lead to malnutrition and compromise his immune system.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium, sodium, and magnesium, may become imbalanced due to his ongoing bleeding, diuretic use, and potential kidney damage.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient is at risk of developing hypoglycemia due to his diabetes and the use of insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's recent CTA showed massive clot burden, which may indicate underlying cardiovascular disease. He is also at risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias, due to his steroid use and potential electrolyte imbalances.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's HCT and transfuse as necessary to maintain a safe level.
2. Consider repeat CTA to evaluate for recurrent PE.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medication dosing accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust medication dosing as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's glucose levels closely and adjust insulin and oral hypoglycemic agent dosing accordingly.
6. Consider using alternative anticoagulation therapy, such as warfarin, to reduce the risk of recurrent PE.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust medication dosing as necessary.
8. Consider using prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: 56 year old male with DMII, HTN, crohn's disease, on
   steroids, diverticulosis s/p colectomy X 2, who was admitted to the
   MICU on [**7-29**] for respiratory failure requiring intubation secondary to
   submassive PE. Transferred to floor yesterday night s/p lysis now with
   continued maroon stools and falling HCT.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Colonoscopy this morning showed active Crohn's disease but no
   evidence of current bleeding.  GI recommended IVC filter and continued
   systemic anticoagulation.
   -Colonoscopy:
   Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
   Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
   Ulceration and erythema from the transverse colon to cecum compatible
   with Crohn's disease
   Blood clots in the whole colon.  In the terminal ileum, we found normal
   mucosa.  No blood clot and red blood were noticed in the terminal
   ileum.  The stool in the terminal ileum was yellow.  The G.I. bleeding,
   therefore, most likely occurred in the colon.
   Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
   - IVC filter  by IR in am
   - Hct 30, 31, 32
   - no blood needed

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a complex medical history, including DMII, HTN, Crohn's disease, and diverticulosis, who was admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure secondary to submassive PE. The patient has been treated with TPA lysis, heparin, and corticosteroids, which has led to a Crohn's flare and ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin has been falling, and he has required transfusions.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, and he has been extubated. However, he remains at risk for further bleeding and complications related to his underlying medical conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing bleeding is a significant concern, and further bleeding can lead to hypovolemic shock, anemia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of PE, and further clotting can lead to recurrent PE, which can be life-threatening.
3. Crohn's disease complications: The patient's active Crohn's flare can lead to complications such as abscesses, fistulas, and intestinal obstruction.
4. Renal failure: The patient's recent Cr levels have ranged from 1.3 to 2.0, and further decline can lead to acute kidney injury and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia can lead to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome.
6. Hypotension: The patient's ongoing bleeding and potential for further bleeding can lead to hypotension, which can be life-threatening.
7. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and ongoing bleeding can increase his risk of infection, which can be life-threatening.

In conclusion, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications. The patient's bleeding, respiratory status, and underlying medical conditions must be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications and improve his overall outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and a recent diagnosis of Crohn's colitis. He has undergone lysis and has a slow gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) due to active Crohn's. The patient has been placed on heparin and warfarin for anticoagulation, and is being treated with prednisone, mesalamine, and gastrointestinal follow-up. He is also receiving regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's GIB may worsen, leading to hypovolemic shock, coagulopathy, or even death.
2. Pulmonary complications: The massive PE may lead to further respiratory failure, ARDS, or even cardiac arrest.
3. Renal complications: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, or even end-stage renal disease.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hyperkalemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation or asystole.
5. Infections: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to Crohn's disease and corticosteroid therapy may increase the risk of infections, including sepsis.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's active Crohn's disease may lead to further gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.
7. Nutritional complications: The patient's malnutrition may worsen, leading to further weight loss, muscle wasting, and impaired wound healing.
8. Psychiatric complications: The patient's critical illness may lead to anxiety, depression, or delirium.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these complications and improve his overall outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and a recent diagnosis of Crohn's colitis. The patient had undergone lysis and was placed on anticoagulation therapy. The patient is currently experiencing slow gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from active Crohn's disease.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, and blood pressure of 143/75 mmHg. The patient is receiving heparin infusions and warfarin therapy for anticoagulation. The patient is also receiving prednisone, mesalamine, and gastrointestinal follow-up for management of Crohn's disease.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.5, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 309. The patient's coagulation studies show an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.1, and the patient is not experiencing any bleeding complications.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance with no acute distress. The patient's abdominal examination is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. The patient's extremities are warm and without any signs of rash or jaundice.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient is at risk of bleeding complications due to the anticoagulation therapy and the presence of gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Thrombotic complications: The patient is at risk of developing thrombotic complications due to the presence of a pulmonary embolism and the use of anticoagulation therapy.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the presence of a central venous catheter and the use of immunosuppressive therapy.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk of developing gastrointestinal complications such as perforation, abscess, or stricture due to the presence of active Crohn's disease.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient is at risk of developing cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction due to the presence of a pulmonary embolism and the use of anticoagulation therapy.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their anticoagulation therapy, gastrointestinal bleeding, and Crohn's disease to prevent potential complications."
