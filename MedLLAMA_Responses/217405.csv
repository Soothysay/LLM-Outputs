   Assessment and Plan
   87 yoM w/ a h/o CKD presents with ACS in setting of severe anemia
   likely secondary to UGI bleed.
   .
   # CORONARIES: NSTEMI given lack of ST elevations on EKG, did have pain
   and positive troponins.  He is high risk and ideally would undergo
   maximal medical therapy and undergo cardiac catheterization however he
   has a high risk given large GI bleed.  In addition his symptoms began
   48 hours ago and are likely secondary to his bleed rather than plaque
   rupture.  Given bleed will need to medically manage.
   -high dose statin
   -low dose beta blocker, up titrate as tolerated
   -transfuse for hct < 30
   -start ACEi eventually when Cr stabilized and out of acute setting
   -aspirin 325mg daily
   -EKG in a.m.
   .
   # PUMP: obtain echo to evaluate EF as well as for valvular disease or
   possible complications of missed infarction.  The patient is in acute
   heart failure with signs of both L and R heart failure.  Lasix drip
   with goal diuresis 1 liter negative today.
   -continue BiPAP, with blood transfusions may need intubation if
   oxygenation worsens
   -BP currently normal, hold antihypertensives for now and start as
   needed
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, monitor on tele
   .
   # GI bleed: Melena with a hct drop.  Likely bleeding source, given ACS
   will have to transfuse to goal HCT of 30.
   -maintain active type and screen
   -GI consult- f/u recs
   -protonix drip at 8mg / hr
   -2 large bore IVs (has 4 PIV now)
   -other causes for anemia would be chronic or possibly hemolysis
   -having hard stool now, seen by GI in ED, consented by GI for EGD in
   case, likely in future
   -? cirrhosis 30 years ago but hadn't had any further characterization,
   since then has cut down his drinking.  will send albumin.  No other
   stigmata of liver disease.  Varicies are another possible source but
   cirrhosis / portal hypertension seems unlikely
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Given GI bleed and MI / CHF likely a
   result of pre-renal causes. (bleed vs. poor forward flow from CHF)
   FENA 23.9
   -send u/a and urine lytes
   -if not improving obtain renal ultrasound
   -baseline cr from 1 year ago was 1.6
   .
   # ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: anion gap is 18.  Given CHF and bleed this is
   possibly due to a lactic acidosis.
   -send lactate and trend
   -glucose is 242, patient is possibly a diabetic but given this degree
   of hyperglycemia his gap is unlikely related to DKA.  F/u U/a
   -another possibility would be uremia although lactic acidosis is still
   more likely.
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: possibly related to acute renal failure.
   -send p.m. hct, likely will come down with lasix drip
   -recheck p.m. potassium
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: likely as a result of acute MI however will need to
   rule out other causes.
   -f/u final read on CXR
   -send urine culture, u/a.  Blood cultures, f/u final read of CXR
   -re-culture if [**Last Name (LF) 2180**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] hold off on antibiotics for now but did
   recieve broad spectrum abx upon initial presentation.
   .
   # DM: lantus 7uqhs.  insulin sliding scale, goal BG < 150.
   -qid finger stick glucose
   -hold oral hypoglycemics

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) who presented with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and a severe anemia likely secondary to upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed. The patient has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 133/53 mmHg. The patient is receiving non-invasive ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60% and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, and creatinine of 3.0 mg/dL. The patient's troponin-T level is elevated at 1.41 ng/mL, indicating myocardial infarction (MI). The patient's lactate level is elevated at 1.6 mmol/L, suggesting anion gap acidosis.

The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis 30 years ago, but he has not had any further characterization since then. The patient is at risk for chronic renal failure, and his baseline creatinine level from 1 year ago was 1.6 mg/dL.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): Given the patient's history of CKD and the presence of anion gap acidosis, AKI is a potential complication.
2. Lactic acidosis: The patient's elevated lactate level suggests lactic acidosis, which can be a complication of AKI or sepsis.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated at 5.6 mEq/L, which can be a complication of AKI or chronic kidney disease.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 13.3 K/uL, which can be a complication of MI or sepsis.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray is pending, and the patient is at risk for pneumonia given the presence of anemia and leukocytosis.
6. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate level and leukocytosis suggest sepsis, which can be a complication of AKI or MI.
7. GI bleeding: The patient's ongoing GI bleeding is a potential complication that requires close monitoring and management.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, including AKI, lactic acidosis, hyperkalemia, leukocytosis, pneumonia, sepsis, and GI bleeding. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yoM w/ a h/o CKD presents with ACS in setting of severe anemia
   likely secondary to UGI bleed.
   .
   # CORONARIES: NSTEMI given lack of ST elevations on EKG, did have pain
   and positive troponins. He is high risk and ideally would undergo
   maximal medical therapy and undergo cardiac catheterization however he
   has a high risk given large GI bleed. In addition his symptoms began 48
   hours ago and are likely secondary to his bleed rather than plaque
   rupture. Given bleed will need to medically manage.
   -high dose statin
   -low dose beta blocker, up titrate as tolerated
   -transfuse for hct < 30
   -start ACEi eventually when Cr stabilized and out of acute setting
   -aspirin 325mg daily
   -EKG in a.m.
   .
   # PUMP: obtain echo to evaluate EF as well as for valvular disease or
   possible complications of missed infarction. The patient is in acute
   heart failure with signs of both L and R heart failure. Lasix drip with
   goal diuresis 1 liter negative today.
   -continue BiPAP, with blood transfusions may need intubation if
   oxygenation worsens
   -BP currently normal, hold antihypertensives for now and start as
   needed
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, monitor on tele
   .
   # GI bleed: Melena with a hct drop, however Hct stable overnight.
   Likely bleeding source, given ACS will have to transfuse to goal HCT of
   30.
   -maintain active type and screen
   -GI consult- f/u recs
   -protonix drip at 8mg / hr
   -2 large bore IVs (has 4 PIV now)
   -other causes for anemia would be chronic or possibly hemolysis
   -having hard stool now, seen by GI in ED, consented by GI for EGD in
   case, likely in future

   stigmata of liver disease. Varicies are another possible source but
   cirrhosis / portal hypertension seems unlikely

   # Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Given GI bleed and MI / CHF likely a
   result of pre-renal causes. (bleed vs. poor forward flow from CHF)
   -send u/a and urine lytes
   -if not improving obtain renal ultrasound
   -baseline cr from 1 year ago was 1.6
   .
   # ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: anion gap improved to 14 from 18. Lactate mostly
   normal, but may have been more elevated at time of gap. Elevated BUN
   may suggest a small component of uremia. Glucose was 242, but given
   this degree of hyperglycemia his gap is unlikely related to DKA. No

   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Afebrile with downtrending WBC. Elevated WBC likely as
   a result of acute MI however will need to rule out other causes.
   -f/u final read on CXR

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cirrhosis, who presented with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and severe anemia likely secondary to upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed. He is currently on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and has a high risk of cardiac complications. His vital signs are stable, but he has signs of heart failure, and his lactate level is elevated. He is also experiencing anemia, and his hemoglobin (Hb) level is 10.6 g/dL. His platelet count is 274 K/uL, and his white blood cell (WBC) count is 13.3 K/uL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* NSTEMI with high risk of cardiac complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
	* High risk of bleeding complications due to UGI bleed and anticoagulant therapy.
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections due to NIV and hospitalization.
	* Respiratory failure due to cardiac complications or underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
3. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Continued bleeding from UGI source, potentially leading to hypovolemic shock.
	* Gastrointestinal perforation or obstruction due to UGI bleed or other underlying conditions.
4. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypovolemia, cardiac complications, or underlying CKD.
	* Chronic kidney disease progression due to underlying CKD and potential for further kidney damage from cardiac complications.
5. Hematological Complications:
	* Anemia due to UGI bleed, potential for further bleeding complications.
	* Thrombocytopenia due to UGI bleed or other underlying conditions, potentially leading to bleeding complications.
6. Metabolic Complications:
	* Hyperglycemia due to stress response, potentially leading to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome (HHNS).
	* Electrolyte imbalances due to cardiac complications, potential for further electrolyte disturbances.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor patient's vital signs and cardiac status closely, including ECG and cardiac enzymes.
2. Continue NIV and monitor for respiratory complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yoM w/ h/o CKD presents with acute on chronic diastolic CHF
   exacerbation and ACS. Likely progression of events: GIB -> Anemia ->
   Cardiac ischemia -> Tachycardia with poor diastolic filling time + 2U
   pRBC for Hct 22 in setting of chest pain -> CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  His presentation is consistent
   with acute on chronic CHF.  He was significantly diuresed, now 8L
   negative for LOS.  He has not had elevations in Cr or hypotension.
   ECHO showed no WMA or valvular disease, rather impaired relaxation.
   Tachycardia has generally resolved.
   - Will continue diuresis with lasix drip with a goal of 1-2L
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerates
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Low-grade temperature and persestantly elevated white
   count.  Elevated WBC could be a result of acute MI, but might also
   represent slowly brewing infection.  Urine culture negative.  Blood
   cultures pending.
   - Will check PA and lateral today to eval for brewing PNA that may have
   been masked by volume
   - Consider CT if worsening.
   - No antibiotics for now
   - Follow cultures.
   - re-culture if spikes, consider antibiotics based on CXR findings from
   today.
   .
   # NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION - He presented with chest pain
   for 48 hours prior to admission and positive troponins but no ST or T
   wave changes on EKG.  His troponins came down over his first day and he
   remains pain free.  He was started on medical management with ASA, BB,
   statin, with a goal of adding an ACEi when renal function stabilizes.
   - ASA, Metoprolol, Statin
   - transfuse for hct < 30 if symptomatic
   - Will consider further diagnostic workup with stress, cath, MR, or CT
   once stable.
   .
   # SINUS TACHYCARDIA: Has was tachycardic since coming off BiPAP.
   Originally this was refractory to increasing doses of metoprolol from
   12.5mg TID to 75mg TID, that was done to allow for diastolic filling
   time.   His tachycardia has since improved with improving respiratory
   status, suggesting tachycardia was secondary to resp discomfort.
   .
   # GI BLEED: He presented with Hct drop and melena but since admission
   and transfusion Hct has been stable.  Given ACS transfuse to goal HCT
   of 30 with symptoms.  He had cirrhosis 30 years ago but hadn't had any
   further characterization, since then has cut down his drinking.  No
   physical exam findings of liver disease, but ultrasound showed fatty
   change.  US findings could be consistent with cirrhosis but is more
   likely related to congestion.
   - Type and screen, IVs, guaiac stool
   - GI following

   - having hard stool now, seen by GI in ED, consented by GI for EGD in
   case, likely in future

   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Baseline Cr 1.6, Peak here 3.
   - History consistent with prerenal causes but FeUrea not consistent
   (45%). [**Month (only) 8**] be ATN secondary to prolonged hypoperfusion, vs med related,
   vs postrenal.
   - If not improving obtain renal ultrasound
   .
   # ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: anion gap continues to be elevated at 16 with
   normal albumin.
   - Lactate normal, no sign of ketoacidosis
   - Possibly uremia
   - ? check tox screen or osmolar gap to eval for ingestions. IE:
   Ethylene glycol -> cardiopulm failure, renal failure, AG acidosis.
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: resolved with diuresis
   .
   # DM: lantus 7uqhs.  insulin sliding scale, goal BG < 150.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient, an 87-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), presented with an acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic heart failure (CHF) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of acute on chronic diastolic CHF, ACS, and anemia. The patient's condition has been stable, with improving respiratory status and decreased tachycardia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a low-grade temperature, suggesting possible infection
* Elevated troponin levels, indicating cardiac ischemia
* Elevated creatinine (Cr) levels, indicating acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Elevated anion gap, suggesting possible anion gap acidosis
* Hyperkalemia, which has resolved with diuresis
* Poor glycemic control, requiring increased insulin dosage

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Moderate distension of the abdomen, with a palpable liver edge 3 cm below the costal margin
* Trace bilateral pedal edema, with a right greater than left edema
* Scattered rales in the lungs, with no wheezes

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continued diuresis with furosemide (Lasix) drip to achieve a goal of 1-2 L of negative fluid balance
* Weaning of oxygen therapy as tolerated
* Monitoring of WBC count and urine culture for signs of infection
* Consideration of computed tomography (CT) scan if worsening of symptoms
* No antibiotics for now, with follow-up cultures and consideration of antibiotics based on chest X-ray findings
* Transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) for hemoglobin (Hb) level < 30
* Medical management of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin
* Consideration of further diagnostic workup with stress, catheterization, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or CT scan once stable

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to possible infection
* Cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure
* Renal failure or worsening of AKI
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
* Respiratory failure or worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
* Anion gap acidosis or worsening of metabolic acidosis
* Hyperkalemia or worsening of electrolyte imbalance
* Poor glycemic control or worsening of diabetes mellitus

I will continue to monitor the patient's condition and adjust the medical plan as necessary to ensure optimal care and management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 66-inch tall individual who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient has been receiving furosemide infusions and pantoprazole for their condition. The patient's vital signs have improved, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 124/53 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status has also improved, with an oxygen saturation of 92% and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a sinus rhythm and a systolic murmur at the upper sternal border. The patient's abdominal examination is notable for moderate distension and a palpable liver edge 3 cm below the costal margin.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 15.2 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dL, and a platelet count of 249 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a sodium level of 140 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, and chloride level of 104 mEq/L. The patient's blood urea nitrogen level is 40 mg/dL, and their creatinine level is 2.2 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has improved, but they are still receiving oxygen therapy and have a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. They may be at risk for respiratory failure if their oxygen saturation drops or if they develop pneumonia.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a systolic murmur at the upper sternal border, which may indicate a cardiac condition such as mitral valve disease or aortic stenosis. They may be at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has moderate distension and a palpable liver edge, which may indicate gastrointestinal complications such as ileus, pancreatitis, or cholecystitis. They may be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or abscess formation.
4. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate renal failure. They may be at risk for acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, or end-stage renal disease.
5. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate infection. They may be at risk for sepsis, septic shock, or organ failure.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   IU/L, Ca++:10.1 mg/dL, Mg++:1.8 mg/dL, PO4:3.7 mg/dL
   BCX NGTD;  Chest PA/Lat: stable pulm edema, no consolidation.
   Assessment and Plan
   87 yoM w/ h/o CKD presents with acute on chronic diastolic CHF
   exacerbation and ACS. Likely progression of events: GIB -> Anemia ->
   Cardiac ischemia -> Tachycardia with poor diastolic filling time + 2U
   pRBC for Hct 22 in setting of chest pain -> CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  His presentation is consistent
   with acute on chronic CHF.  He was significantly diuresed, now 9L
   negative for LOS.  Cr is mildly elevated today but still seems to have
   fluid overload, as he stil has an O2 requirement.  ECHO showed no WMA
   or valvular disease, rather impaired relaxation.  Tachycardia has
   generally resolved.
   - Will continue diuresis with decreased lasix drip rate (2.5 mg/hr)
   with a goal of -500 cc.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerates
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Low-grade temperature and persestantly elevated white
   count.  Elevated WBC could be a result of acute MI, DVT, but might also
   represent slowly brewing infection.  Urine culture negative.  Blood
   cultures pending.  CXR with no evidence of new infiltrate.
   - No antibiotics for now
   - Follow cultures.
   - re-culture if spikes
   .
   # LEG PAIN:  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to compression from pneuomboots.  No
   swelling, but must r/o DVT.  Also possibly related to gout in setting
   of diuresis, but no evidence of joint symptoms on exam.
   - vascular ultrasound today
   .
   # NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION - He presented with chest pain
   for 48 hours prior to admission and positive troponins but no ST or T
   wave changes on EKG.  His troponins came down over his first day and he
   remains pain free.  He was started on medical management with ASA, BB,
   statin, with a goal of adding an ACEi when renal function stabilizes.
   - ASA, Metoprolol, Statin
   - transfuse for hct < 25 if symptomatic
   - Will consider further diagnostic workup with stress, cath, MR, or CT
   once stable.
   .
   # SINUS TACHYCARDIA: Had A-fib/A-flutter last night that broke with
   iincreased nodal blocking.  Will continue on increased doses of
   metoprolol 100 TID and dilt 60 mg QID, as diastolic HF not tolerant of
   A-fib.
   .
   # GI BLEED: He presented with Hct drop and melena but since admission
   and transfusion Hct has been stable, although Hct is somewhat down this
   morning.  Stools remain guiac positive.  Given chest pain free, ok to
   allow Hct to drift to 25.  He had cirrhosis 30 years ago but hadn't had
   any further characterization, since then has cut down his drinking.  No
   physical exam findings of liver disease, but ultrasound showed fatty
   change.  US findings could be consistent with cirrhosis but is more
   likely related to congestion.
   - Will recheck Hct in PM
   - GI following, scope planned for monday but may need to be earlier if
   bleeding picks up.
   - protonix PO BID
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Baseline Cr 1.6, Peak here 3.
   - History consistent with prerenal causes but FeUrea not consistent
   (45%). [**Month (only) 8**] be ATN secondary to prolonged hypoperfusion, vs med related,
   vs postrenal.
   - If not improving obtain renal ultrasound
   .
   # ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: anion gap was elevated on admission without
   significant lactare or ketones and modestly elevated BUN.  This has
   since resolved, with a gap today of 12.
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: resolved with diuresis
   .
   # DM: lantus 7uqhs.  insulin sliding scale, goal BG < 150.
   - Poor control, so lantus increased to 10U
   .
   FEN: Will advance diet.  NPO when planned for EGD.
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, PPI given GI bleed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Called out but then called back in.  Overnight developed irregular SVT,
   likely atrial tachycardia with intermittent conduction.  Received
   lopressor and dilt IV and then increased PO doses of both meds.
   Returned to NSR around midnight.  Had some leg pain, LENIs ordered.
   CXR showed no new consolidation.  PM labs repleated.  Daughter raised
   possibility of transferring back to be closer to family but agreed that
   it might be safer to keep him here.
   This morning he complains of leg pain but no chest pain, dyspnea, or
   pain anywhere else
   Allergies:
   No Known Drug Allergies
   Last dose of Antibiotics:
   Infusions:
   Furosemide (Lasix) - 5 mg/hour

   .
   # SINUS TACHYCARDIA: Had A-fib/A-flutter last night that broke with
   iincreased nodal blocking.  Will continue on increased doses of
   metoprolol 100 TID and dilt 60 mg QID, as diastolic HF not tolerant of
   A-fib.
   .
   # GI BLEED: He presented with Hct drop and melena but since admission
   and transfusion Hct has been stable, although Hct is somewhat down this
   morning.  Stools remain guiac positive.  Given chest pain free, ok to
   allow Hct to drift to 25.  He had cirrhosis 30 years ago but hadn't had
   any further characterization, since then has cut down his drinking.  No
   physical exam findings of liver disease, but ultrasound showed fatty
   change.  US findings could be consistent with cirrhosis but is more
   likely related to congestion.
   - Will recheck Hct in PM
   - GI following, scope planned for monday but may need to be earlier if
   bleeding picks up.
   - protonix PO BID
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Baseline Cr 1.6, Peak here 3.
   - History consistent with prerenal causes but FeUrea not consistent
   (45%). [**Month (only) 8**] be ATN secondary to prolonged hypoperfusion, vs med related,
   vs postrenal.
   - If not improving obtain renal ultrasound
   .
   # ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: anion gap was elevated on admission without
   significant lactare or ketones and modestly elevated BUN.  This has
   since resolved, with a gap today of 12.
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: resolved with diuresis
   .
   # DM: lantus 7uqhs.  insulin sliding scale, goal BG < 150.
   - Poor control, so lantus increased to 10U
   .
   FEN: Will advance diet.  NPO when planned for EGD.

   IU/L, Ca++:10.1 mg/dL, Mg++:1.8 mg/dL, PO4:3.7 mg/dL
   Assessment and Plan
   87 yoM w/ h/o CKD presents with acute on chronic diastolic CHF
   exacerbation and ACS. Likely progression of events: GIB -> Anemia ->
   Cardiac ischemia -> Tachycardia with poor diastolic filling time + 2U
   pRBC for Hct 22 in setting of chest pain -> CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  His presentation is consistent
   with acute on chronic CHF.  He was significantly diuresed, now 8L
   negative for LOS.  He has not had elevations in Cr or hypotension.
   ECHO showed no WMA or valvular disease, rather impaired relaxation.
   Tachycardia has generally resolved.
   - Will continue diuresis with lasix drip with a goal of 1-2L
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerates
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Low-grade temperature and persestantly elevated white
   count.  Elevated WBC could be a result of acute MI, but might also
   represent slowly brewing infection.  Urine culture negative.  Blood
   cultures pending.
   - Will check PA and lateral today to eval for brewing PNA that may have
   been masked by volume
   - Consider CT if worsening.
   - No antibiotics for now
   - Follow cultures.
   - re-culture if spikes, consider antibiotics based on CXR findings from
   today.
   .
   # NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION - He presented with chest pain
   for 48 hours prior to admission and positive troponins but no ST or T
   wave changes on EKG.  His troponins came down over his first day and he
   remains pain free.  He was started on medical management with ASA, BB,
   statin, with a goal of adding an ACEi when renal function stabilizes.
   - ASA, Metoprolol, Statin
   - transfuse for hct < 30 if symptomatic
   - Will consider further diagnostic workup with stress, cath, MR, or CT
   once stable.
   .
   # SINUS TACHYCARDIA: Has was tachycardic since coming off BiPAP.
   Originally this was refractory to increasing doses of metoprolol from
   12.5mg TID to 75mg TID, that was done to allow for diastolic filling
   time.   His tachycardia has since improved with improving respiratory
   status, suggesting tachycardia was secondary to resp discomfort.
   .
   # GI BLEED: He presented with Hct drop and melena but since admission
   and transfusion Hct has been stable.  Given ACS transfuse to goal HCT
   of 30 with symptoms.  He had cirrhosis 30 years ago but hadn't had any
   further characterization, since then has cut down his drinking.  No
   physical exam findings of liver disease, but ultrasound showed fatty
   change.  US findings could be consistent with cirrhosis but is more
   likely related to congestion.
   - Type and screen, IVs, guaiac stool
   - GI following
   - protonix PO BID
   - having hard stool now, seen by GI in ED, consented by GI for EGD in
   case, likely in future
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Baseline Cr 1.6, Peak here 3.
   - History consistent with prerenal causes but FeUrea not consistent
   (45%). [**Month (only) 8**] be ATN secondary to prolonged hypoperfusion, vs med related,
   vs postrenal.
   - If not improving obtain renal ultrasound
   .
   # ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: anion gap continues to be elevated at 16 with
   normal albumin.
   - Lactate normal, no sign of ketoacidosis
   - Possibly uremia
   - ? check tox screen or osmolar gap to eval for ingestions. IE:
   Ethylene glycol -> cardiopulm failure, renal failure, AG acidosis.
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: resolved with diuresis
   .
   # DM: lantus 7uqhs.  insulin sliding scale, goal BG < 150.
   - Poor control, will increase to 10U
   .
   FEN: Will advance diet.  NPO when planned for EGD.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yoM w/ h/o CKD presents with acute on chronic diastolic CHF
   exacerbation and ACS. Likely progression of events: GIB -> Anemia ->
   Cardiac ischemia -> Tachycardia with poor diastolic filling time + 2U
   pRBC for Hct 22 in setting of chest pain -> CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  His presentation is consistent
   with acute on chronic CHF.  He was significantly diuresed, now 8L
   negative for LOS.  He has not had elevations in Cr or hypotension.
   ECHO showed no WMA or valvular disease, rather impaired relaxation.
   Tachycardia has generally resolved.
   - Will continue diuresis with lasix drip with a goal of 1-2L
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerates
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Low-grade temperature and persestantly elevated white
   count.  Elevated WBC could be a result of acute MI, but might also
   represent slowly brewing infection.  Urine culture negative.  Blood
   cultures pending.
   - Will check PA and lateral today to eval for brewing PNA that may have
   been masked by volume
   - Consider CT if worsening.
   - No antibiotics for now
   - Follow cultures.
   - re-culture if spikes, consider antibiotics based on CXR findings from
   today.
   .
   # NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION - He presented with chest pain
   for 48 hours prior to admission and positive troponins but no ST or T
   wave changes on EKG.  His troponins came down over his first day and he
   remains pain free.  He was started on medical management with ASA, BB,
   statin, with a goal of adding an ACEi when renal function stabilizes.
   - ASA, Metoprolol, Statin
   - transfuse for hct < 30 if symptomatic
   - Will consider further diagnostic workup with stress, cath, MR, or CT
   once stable.
   .
   # SINUS TACHYCARDIA: Has was tachycardic since coming off BiPAP.
   Originally this was refractory to increasing doses of metoprolol from
   12.5mg TID to 75mg TID, that was done to allow for diastolic filling
   time.   His tachycardia has since improved with improving respiratory
   status, suggesting tachycardia was secondary to resp discomfort.
   .
   # GI BLEED: He presented with Hct drop and melena but since admission
   and transfusion Hct has been stable.  Given ACS transfuse to goal HCT
   of 30 with symptoms.  He had cirrhosis 30 years ago but hadn't had any
   further characterization, since then has cut down his drinking.  No
   physical exam findings of liver disease, but ultrasound showed fatty
   change.  US findings could be consistent with cirrhosis but is more
   likely related to congestion.
   - Type and screen, IVs, guaiac stool
   - GI following
   - protonix PO BID
   - having hard stool now, seen by GI in ED, consented by GI for EGD in
   case, likely in future
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Baseline Cr 1.6, Peak here 3.
   - History consistent with prerenal causes but FeUrea not consistent
   (45%). [**Month (only) 8**] be ATN secondary to prolonged hypoperfusion, vs med related,
   vs postrenal.
   - If not improving obtain renal ultrasound
   .
   # ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: anion gap continues to be elevated at 16 with
   normal albumin.
   - Lactate normal, no sign of ketoacidosis
   - Possibly uremia
   - ? check tox screen or osmolar gap to eval for ingestions. IE:
   Ethylene glycol -> cardiopulm failure, renal failure, AG acidosis.
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: resolved with diuresis
   .
   # DM: lantus 7uqhs.  insulin sliding scale, goal BG < 150.
   - Poor control, will increase to 10U
   .
   FEN: Will advance diet.  NPO when planned for EGD.
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, PPI given GI bleed

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who presented with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He has been treated with diuresis, oxygen therapy, and medications for his heart condition. He has also been transfused with packed red blood cells (pRBCs) for anemia.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a heart rate of 88 beats per minute (bpm) and blood pressure of 125/47 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 94% on a nasal cannula. He has a moderate degree of distension and a palpable liver edge 3 cm below the costal margin. His extremities are warm and well-perfused, with trace bilateral pedal edema.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's condition is likely to worsen if his diuretic therapy is not optimized or if he experiences a decline in his cardiac function.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may be a sign of an underlying infection, which could worsen his condition.
3. Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction: The patient's NSTEMI may progress to a more severe form of heart damage if he does not receive timely and effective treatment.
4. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient's anion gap acidosis may be a sign of a metabolic disorder or a complication of his heart failure, which could worsen his condition.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia may recur if his diuretic therapy is not optimized or if he experiences a decline in his cardiac function.
6. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen if he does not receive timely and effective treatment for his underlying condition.
7. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may worsen if he does not receive timely and effective treatment for his underlying condition.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is stable, but he requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications. He will continue to receive diuretic therapy and oxygen therapy, and his medications will be adjusted as needed. He will also be monitored for signs of infection and treated promptly if an infection is suspected."
