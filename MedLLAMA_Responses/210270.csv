   25-30% by pt report, NIDDM, TIMI score [**6-16**], who presents from an
   outside hospital after episode of chest/abdominal pressure,
   diaphoresis, dyspnea, with positive cardiac enzymes, and no ST
   elevations, consistent with NSTEMI.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt currently chest pain free, no new ST elevations or
   other EKG findings to suggest acute MI. No need for emergent
   revascularization or lysis at this time. Plan for diagnostic cath on
   Monday (today) if Pt continues to be hemodynamically stable, at which
   point can eval for percutaneous intervention vs potential CABG. If
   hemodynamically unstable or EKG changes concerning for evolving acute
   MI can activate cath lab.  Remained asymptomatic and Hemodynamically

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and left ventricular aneurysm. He was admitted to the ICU with chest and abdominal pain, diaphoresis, and dyspnea, consistent with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He has been asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable since admission. His current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, and integrilin. His labs show elevated troponin levels, but no ST elevations on his EKG.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and LV aneurysm increases his risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's pulmonary edema on CXR and his history of CHF increase his risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia and respiratory failure.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of abdominal pain and his current medications, such as heparin and integrilin, increase his risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding and perforation.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's history of diabetes and his current medications, such as metformin and Januvia, increase his risk for neurological complications, such as seizures and stroke.
5. Infection complications: The patient's history of CAD and his current medications, such as heparin and integrilin, increase his risk for infection complications, such as sepsis and endocarditis.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's history of abdominal pain and his current medications, such as heparin and integrilin, increase his risk for bleeding complications, such as hematomas and hemorrhages.
7. Renal complications: The patient's history of diabetes and his current medications, such as metformin and Januvia, increase his risk for renal complications, such as acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.

Overall, the patient's risk for medical complications is high due to his complex medical history and current medications. Close monitoring and management of his condition are necessary to prevent and treat any potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and left ventricular aneurysm. He presented to the hospital with chest and abdominal pain, diaphoresis, and dyspnea, consistent with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has been asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable since admission.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a heart rate of 71 beats per minute, blood pressure of 106/58 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and he is receiving oxygen via nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated cardiac enzymes, including troponin-T, CK, and CKMB, consistent with myocardial infarction. His hemoglobin level is 11.7 g/dL, and his platelet count is 243 K/uL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level of 5.53 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress. His cardiovascular examination is normal, with a normal pulse and blood pressure. His respiratory examination is also normal, with clear breath sounds and no signs of respiratory distress.

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and left ventricular aneurysm, as well as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). He is currently taking aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin, and is being treated with a beta blocker and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.

The patient's plan of care includes continued treatment with aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin, as well as beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. He will also undergo a diagnostic catheterization on Monday to evaluate for percutaneous intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting. If the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable or shows signs of evolving acute myocardial infarction, he will be activated for catheterization.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Continued chest pain and discomfort
2. Development of acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina
3. Hemodynamic instability or cardiac arrhythmias
4. Pulmonary edema or respiratory failure
5. Infection or sepsis
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
7. Renal failure or acute kidney injury
8. Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia
9. Electrolyte imbalances or acid-base disorders
10. Thrombocytopenia or bleeding complications

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   Pt is a pleasant 76 yo M w/ PMHx of CAD s/p MI w/ LV aneurysm, EF
   25-30% by pt report, NIDDM, TIMI score [**6-16**], who presents from an
   outside hospital after episode of chest/abdominal pressure,
   diaphoresis, dyspnea, with positive cardiac enzymes, and no ST
   elevations, consistent with NSTEMI.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt currently chest pain free, no new ST elevations or
   other EKG findings to suggest acute MI. No need for emergent
   revascularization or lysis at this time. Plan for diagnostic cath on
   Monday (today) if Pt continues to be hemodynamically stable, at which
   point can eval for percutaneous intervention vs potential CABG. If
   hemodynamically unstable or EKG changes concerning for evolving acute
   MI can activate cath lab.  Remained asymptomatic and Hemodynamically
   stable on [**2151-10-24**].
   -Cont ASA 81 mg qD
   -Cont plavix 75 mg
   -Holding home crestor. Starting atorvastatin 80 mg
   -PRN oxygen, nitro, morphine,
   - Continue Carvedilol
   - Continue integrillin
   - Maintain chest pain free using nitro, morphine PRN
    .
   # PUMP: Pt reports hx of CHF w/ EF of 25-30% although could not find
   records of this. Only ECHO is from [**2130**] w/ EF > 55%. Pt sx likely w/ a
   component of CHF as he experienced considerable relief w/ lasix, and
   was found to have CXR w/ pulmonary edema. At the moment Pt does not
   appear clinically volume overloaded.  Evidence of significant, chronic
   LV aneurysm on CXR, ECG, likely contributing to systolic dysfunction.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and left ventricular aneurysm. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with chest and abdominal pressure, diaphoresis, and dyspnea, consistent with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient is currently chest pain-free and hemodynamically stable. The plan is to perform a diagnostic catheterization on Monday to evaluate for percutaneous intervention versus potential coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient's symptoms and cardiac enzymes are consistent with NSTEMI, but the patient is currently chest pain-free and hemodynamically stable. However, the risk of acute coronary syndrome remains, and the patient should be closely monitored for any changes in symptoms or cardiac enzymes.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of heart failure with an estimated ejection fraction of 25-30%. The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with heart failure, and the patient is being treated with medications to manage heart failure.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) is normal, but the patient's history of cardiac arrhythmias is unknown. The patient should be closely monitored for any changes in heart rhythm or symptoms.
4. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's chest X-ray (CXR) shows evidence of pulmonary edema, which may be contributing to his symptoms. The patient should be closely monitored for any changes in lung function or symptoms.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to his history of cardiac disease and immobility. The patient is being treated with heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
6. Sepsis: The patient's temperature is slightly elevated, and the patient is at risk for sepsis due to his cardiac disease and immobility. The patient should be closely monitored for any changes in temperature or symptoms.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 96%, but the patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to his history of heart failure and pulmonary edema.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and symptoms closely for any changes.
2. Continue to treat the patient's heart failure with medications and monitor the patient's response.
3. Monitor the patient's heart rhythm and symptoms for any changes.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's lung function and symptoms for any changes.
5. Continue to treat the patient's DVT prophylaxis with heparin.
6. Monitor the patient's temperature and symptoms for any changes.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and left ventricular aneurysm with an ejection fraction of 25-30%. He presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and was found to have severe three-vessel disease on cardiac catheterization. He is being prepared for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient has been experiencing hemoptysis, which is likely due to epistaxis, and is being monitored for further bleeding. He also has pulmonary edema and chronic left ventricular aneurysm, which may be contributing to his systolic dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, due to the patient's severe three-vessel disease and left ventricular aneurysm.
	* Cardiac failure, which may worsen his pulmonary edema and respiratory status.
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia, which may be caused by the patient's chronic pulmonary edema and increased risk of aspiration due to his hemoptysis.
	* Respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
3. Bleeding Complications:
	* Continued bleeding from the patient's nose or lungs, which may lead to hypovolemic shock.
	* Hemorrhagic complications from the patient's cardiac catheterization or CABG surgery.
4. Infectious Complications:
	* Sepsis, which may be caused by the patient's underlying conditions, such as his cardiac disease and pulmonary edema.
	* Respiratory infections, such as pneumonia or bronchitis, which may be exacerbated by the patient's chronic pulmonary edema.
5. Metabolic Complications:
	* Hyperglycemia, which may worsen the patient's cardiac disease and increase his risk of complications.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p MI, and LV aneurysm with an EF of 25-30%. He presented with NSTEMI and was found to have severe 3VD during cardiac catheterization. The patient is being preoperatively prepared for CABG.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiac: The patient is chest pain-free and hemodynamically stable. He has a severe 3VD and is being preoperatively prepared for CABG.
* Respiratory: The patient has mild pulmonary edema superimposed on emphysema, with small left-sided pleural effusions. He is experiencing small-volume hemoptysis and is anxious about the pathology in his lungs.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is 104/48 mmHg, and his heart rate is 91 bpm.
* Laboratory results: The patient's WBC count is 10.4, Hct is 38.4, and platelet count is 243. His troponin-T level is 5.53, and his creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's severe 3VD and LV aneurysm with probable mural thrombus increase his risk of cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and heart failure.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's mild pulmonary edema and emphysema increase his risk of respiratory complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, and pneumonia.
* Bleeding complications: The patient's hemoptysis and epistaxis increase his risk of bleeding complications, including hemorrhagic shock and coagulopathy.
* Infection complications: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures increase his risk of infection complications, including sepsis, septic shock, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Cardiac: The patient will undergo CABG surgery, and he will be started on anticoagulation therapy with heparin and aspirin.
* Respiratory: The patient will be monitored for signs of respiratory distress, and he will be treated with oxygen therapy and bronchodilators as needed.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate will be closely monitored, and he will be treated with vasopressors and inotropes as needed.
* Laboratory monitoring: The patient's laboratory results will be closely monitored, and he will be treated with medications as needed to manage his cardiac and respiratory conditions.

In conclusion, the patient is a high-risk patient who requires close monitoring and management of his cardiac, respiratory, and hemodynamic conditions. He is at risk for various complications, including cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, heart failure, respiratory failure, and bleeding complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and a left ventricular aneurysm (LVA) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 25-30%. He presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was found to have severe three-vessel disease (3VD) on cardiac catheterization. He is being prepared for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and is currently receiving heparin drip and aspirin.

The patient has experienced hemoptysis, which is suspected to be due to epistaxis, and is being evaluated by pulmonology. He has also been experiencing pulmonary edema, which is likely contributing to his systolic dysfunction. He is receiving treatment for his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is being monitored for signs of worsening respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia
	* Cardiac failure, which may worsen his pulmonary edema
	* Infection, such as endocarditis or pericarditis
2. Pulmonary Complications:
	* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections
	* Pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
	* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation
3. Hemoptysis Complications:
	* Nasal mucosal bleeding, which may worsen or lead to epistaxis
	* Pulmonary hemorrhage or hemothorax
	* Aspiration pneumonia or other respiratory complications
4. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
	* Pancreatitis or other gastrointestinal infections
5. Neurological Complications:
	* Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)
	* Seizures or other neurological symptoms
6. Infection Complications:
	* Sepsis or septic shock
	* Meningitis or other central nervous system infections
7. Other Complications:
	* Kidney or liver failure
	* Electrolyte imbalances or other metabolic disorders

It is essential to monitor the patient closely for any signs of worsening cardiac, pulmonary, or other medical complications, and to adjust his treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour event that highlights several key findings. The patient has a transmural infarction of the left ventricular wall, which is causing a significant decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to 25-30%. The patient also has severe coronary artery disease (CAD) with occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA), left anterior descending (LAD) and circumflex (Cx) arteries. The patient has elevated left and right-sided filling pressures, with a right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (RVEDP) of 14 mmHg and a mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 20 mmHg.

The patient has also experienced hemoptysis, which is likely due to epistaxis given the presence of a left ventricular aneurysm with probable mural thrombus. The patient's pulmonary function is compromised, with a CXR showing pulmonary edema and underlying emphysema, and a CT chest showing mild pulmonary edema superimposed on severe emphysema.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, blood pressure of 104/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's neurological status is also stable, with the patient being attentive, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. The patient's creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels are elevated, indicating possible acute kidney injury. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are also elevated, indicating possible liver dysfunction.

Based on the patient's condition, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: Given the patient's severe CAD and decreased LVEF, the patient is at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's compromised pulmonary function and elevated left and right-sided filling pressures make them at risk for developing pulmonary edema.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine and BUN levels indicate possible acute kidney injury, which can worsen if not managed promptly.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated LFTs indicate possible liver dysfunction, which can lead to complications such as coagulopathy or encephalopathy.
5. Sepsis: Given the patient's compromised immune system and potential for bacterial colonization of the lungs, the patient is at risk for developing sepsis.
6. Stroke: The patient's decreased LVEF and elevated troponin-T levels indicate possible ongoing myocardial injury, which can increase the risk of stroke.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's compromised pulmonary function and elevated left and right-sided filling pressures make them at risk for developing respiratory failure.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and left ventricular aneurysm with an ejection fraction of 25-30%. He presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and underwent cardiac catheterization showing severe three-vessel disease. He is being prepped for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and is currently receiving heparin drip and aspirin.

The patient is experiencing hemoptysis, which is likely due to epistaxis, and has been advised to follow up with pulmonary medicine in the morning. He has a history of chronic left ventricular aneurysm, which is contributing to systolic dysfunction, and is receiving treatment for congestive heart failure.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating ongoing myocardial damage. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and his blood glucose levels are being managed with insulin sliding scale.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Myocardial infarction due to severe three-vessel disease
	* Congestive heart failure exacerbation
	* Arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia
2. Pulmonary complications:
	* Pneumonia due to aspiration or sepsis
	* Respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
3. Bleeding complications:
	* Hemorrhagic complications due to anticoagulation therapy
	* Epistaxis or hemoptysis due to nasal or lung pathology
4. Infection complications:
	* Sepsis due to urinary tract infection, pneumonia, or other sources
	* Wound infection or surgical site infection after CABG
5. Metabolic complications:
	* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to insulin therapy
	* Electrolyte imbalances due to medication or underlying conditions
6. Neurological complications:
	* Stroke or transient ischemic attack due to cardiac embolism or atherosclerosis
	* Seizures due to electrolyte imbalance or medication side effects"
