You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. She was intubated for airway protection and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 108/54 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 92%. Her respiratory status is concerning, with a respiratory rate of 19 inspirations per minute and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 153.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated white blood cell count, which may be secondary to recent chemotherapy. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but her calcium and magnesium levels are slightly low.

The patient's medical history is significant for recent chemotherapy and steroid use, which may have contributed to her immunosuppression and increased risk of infection. She has thrush in her airway and is being treated with fluconazole.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, and she may require continued mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever may indicate sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's recent steroid use may have suppressed her adrenal function, leading to adrenal insufficiency.
4. Immunosuppression: The patient's immunosuppressed state may increase her risk of infection and decrease her ability to mount an effective immune response.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase her risk of bleeding, particularly if she requires invasive procedures or surgery.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may exacerbate her respiratory failure and increase her risk of bleeding.
7. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may indicate sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, or hypovolemia.
8. Infection: The patient's thrush in her airway and elevated white blood cell count may indicate a bacterial or fungal infection, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.

In conclusion, the patient is at high risk for respiratory failure, sepsis, and other complications due to her underlying medical conditions and recent chemotherapy. Close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. She was intubated and transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient's current condition is respiratory failure, acute, and she is receiving mechanical ventilation. She also has hypotension, likely due to sepsis, and is receiving fluids and stress dose steroids. The patient has pneumonia, with thrush in her airway, and is receiving antibiotics. She has anemia and thrombocytopenia, likely secondary to recent chemotherapy, and is receiving blood transfusions. The patient's medical history includes steroid use, which may have contributed to her immunosuppression.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen if she is not weaned off mechanical ventilation or if her pneumonia is not adequately treated.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia suggest that she may be developing sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death if not promptly treated.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is likely to progress if not adequately treated with antibiotics, which could lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.
4. Thrush: The patient's thrush in her airway could lead to further respiratory complications if not treated promptly.
5. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia could worsen if not adequately treated with blood transfusions and other supportive care.
6. Immunosuppression: The patient's immunosuppression due to steroid use could increase her risk of developing infections, which could be life-threatening.
7. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's recent steroid use and hypotension suggest that she may be at risk for adrenal insufficiency, which could lead to cardiovascular collapse if not promptly treated.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and adjust settings as necessary to optimize lung function.
2. Continue antibiotics and antifungal therapy for pneumonia and thrush.
3. Monitor and treat sepsis aggressively with fluids, stress dose steroids, and pressors if necessary.
4. Continue blood transfusions and other supportive care for anemia and thrombocytopenia.
5. Monitor and treat immunosuppression with antibiotics and other supportive care.
6. Consider adrenal insufficiency and treat promptly if suspected.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent respiratory failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia.
* She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure.
* She has hypotension, likely due to sepsis or possible adrenal insufficiency, and is receiving fluid boluses to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.
* She has thrush in her airway and is receiving antifungal treatment.
* She has anemia and thrombocytopenia, likely secondary to recent chemotherapy.
* She is receiving stress dose steroids for her cancer treatment and has a history of steroid usage.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and she may require continued mechanical ventilation to support her respiratory function.
2. **Sepsis:** The patient's hypotension and possible adrenal insufficiency suggest that she may be at risk for sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. **Pneumonia:** The patient's pneumonia is likely to be a complication of her lung cancer, and she may require continued antibiotic treatment to prevent further complications.
4. **Thrush:** The patient's thrush in her airway is a potential complication of her immunosuppression, and she may require further antifungal treatment to prevent dissemination.
5. **Anemia and Thrombocytopenia:** The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may require further treatment, such as blood transfusions, to prevent further complications.
6. **Adrenal Insufficiency:** The patient's possible adrenal insufficiency may require further evaluation and treatment to prevent adrenal crisis.
7. **Cancer Progression:** The patient's lung cancer may continue to progress, and she may require further treatment, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, to manage her disease.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and she requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia and respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60%. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 100 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 113/59 mmHg. She has a history of allergies to no known medications and has received antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient has a number of medical complications, including hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorders, respiratory failure, and cancer (NSCLC). She is being managed in the intensive care unit (ICU) with a plan to increase PEEP to 12, continue antibiotics, and taper steroids.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, and the plan to increase PEEP to 12 may help improve oxygenation. However, there is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, which could lead to the need for more invasive interventions such as tracheostomy or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is receiving antibiotics, which may help prevent sepsis. However, there is a risk of developing sepsis, particularly if the patient's underlying lung cancer is not well-controlled.
3. Electrolyte and fluid disorders: The patient has a history of electrolyte and fluid disorders, which could be exacerbated by her respiratory failure and antibiotic therapy. This could lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or seizures.
4. Cancer progression: The patient has NSCLC, which is a life-threatening condition. There is a risk of cancer progression, which could lead to further deterioration in the patient's respiratory function and overall health.
5. Intensive care unit-acquired weakness: The patient is receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation, which could lead to ICU-acquired weakness, a condition characterized by muscle weakness and wasting.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management in the ICU."

   # Hypotension - likely sepsis, initially thought to be possible adrenal
   insufficiency, having been on steroids recently.
   - fluid bolus to keep MAP>60, has not yet required pressors
   - wean sedation as possible.
   - continue steroids -switched from hydrocort to Dexamethasone 4 mg IV
   Q12H yesterday (will need 2 wk taper).
   .
   # PNA - Patient with both a post-obstructive RUL and likely LLL PNA.
   Given her steroid usage, concern re: immunosuppression.  Patient was
   noted to  have thrush in airway.
   -+/- therapeutic bronch; unclear how much this will help; not possible

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 53 yo with recent diagnosis of NSCLC who
   presented to OSH with pneumonia.  Y-stent was removed yesterday,
   transferred to the ICU team for further management.
   .
   # Respiratory failure - intubated for airway protection in preparation
   for her bronchoscopy and stent removal.  Given her substantial
   pnuemonia she was not able to be extubated post-procedure
   -continue abx
   - started bactrim ppx
   - IP consult appreciated
   - continue mechanical ventillation - A/C switch to ardsnet settings;
   increased PEEP to 12; will attempt to wean FiO2 further today
   - follow ABGs.
   .
   # Hypotension - likely sepsis, initially thought to be possible adrenal
   insufficiency, having been on steroids recently.
   - fluid bolus to keep MAP>60, has not yet required pressors
   - wean sedation as possible.
   - continue steroids -switched from hydrocort to Dexamethasone 4 mg IV
   Q12H yesterday (will need 2 wk taper).
   .
   # PNA - Patient with both a post-obstructive RUL and likely LLL PNA.
   Given her steroid usage, concern re: immunosuppression.  Patient was
   noted to  have thrush in airway.
   -+/- therapeutic bronch; unclear how much this will help; not possible
   to do any stenting to relieve obstruction
   - fup BAL cultures, blood cx
   - continue zosyn, cipro, vancomycin and fluconazole for now.  narrow as
   able.
   -On bactrim prophylaxis
   - ID consult appreciated.
   .
   # NSCLC - Decadron use was possibly part of her chemotherapy regimen.
   Unknown duration of steroid therapy
   - decadron as above; bactrim ppx
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia - most likely secondary to recent
   chemotherapy.
   - continue to monitor
   -note, getting heparin TID and  heparin flushes

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. She was intubated for airway protection and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.3°F
* Heart rate: 97 bpm
* Blood pressure: 105/52 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 93%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.8 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 7.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 93 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.5 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.9 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: Extensive right mid and upper lung consolidation consistent with post-obstructive pneumonia/atelectasis.
* Computed Tomography (CT) scan: Diffuse lung nodularity may represent metastatic spread, and/or superimposed infection.

The patient's diagnosis is:

* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
* Hypotension (not shock)
* Electrolyte and fluid disorder, other
* Cancer (malignant neoplasm), lung

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue antibiotics and antifungal therapy
* Continue mechanical ventilation and attempt to wean FiO2 further
* Follow ABGs
* Wean sedation as possible
* Continue steroids and taper
* Monitor for signs of sepsis and adjust fluid management accordingly
* Continue to monitor for anemia and thrombocytopenia
* Continue prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock
* Pneumonia and respiratory failure
* Hypotension and shock
* Electrolyte and fluid disorders
* Cancer progression and metastasis
* Anemia and thrombocytopenia
* Infections such as Legionella, Pneumocystis jirovecii, and fungal infections
* VAP and other ventilator-associated complications

Based on the patient's condition, it is recommended that the patient be closely monitored for signs of sepsis and septic shock, and that the healthcare team be prepared to adjust fluid management and antibiotic therapy accordingly. Additionally, the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia should be closely monitored and managed, and the patient should be counseled on the importance of adhering to her medication regimen and following up with her healthcare provider as scheduled."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. She was intubated for airway protection and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.3°F (38.5°C)
* Heart rate: 97 bpm
* Blood pressure: 105/52 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 93%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.8 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 7.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 93 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
* Potassium: 4.7 mEq/L
* Sodium: 139 mEq/L
* Chloride: 26 mg/dL

The patient's respiratory culture shows mixed bacterial types, including Gram-negative rods and yeast. The Legionella culture is negative.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and adjust settings as needed.
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she is receiving fluid boluses to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. The plan is to wean sedation as possible and continue steroids.
* Pneumonia: The patient has both post-obstructive right upper lobe and likely left lower lobe pneumonia. The plan is to continue antibiotics and antifungals, and to monitor for signs of infection.
* Cancer: The patient has a recent diagnosis of NSCLC and is receiving chemotherapy. The plan is to continue chemotherapy and monitor for signs of progression.
* Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely secondary to recent chemotherapy. The plan is to monitor and treat as necessary.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if not properly managed.
* Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and fever suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
* Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia can worsen if not properly treated with antibiotics and antifungals.

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 53 yo with recent diagnosis of NSCLC who
   presented to OSH with pneumonia.  Y-stent was removed yesterday,
   transferred to the ICU team for further management.
   .
   # Respiratory failure - intubated for airway protection in preparation
   for her bronchoscopy and stent removal.  Given her substantial
   pnuemonia she was not able to be extubated post-procedure
   - IP consult appreciated.
   - continue mechanical ventillation - A/C; increased PEEP to 12
   - follow ABGs.
   .
   # Hypotension - likely sepsis, initially thought to be possible adrenal
   insufficiency, having been on steroids recently.
   - fluid bolus to keep MAP>60, has not yet required pressors
   - wean sedation as possible.
   - continue steroids -switched from hydrocort to Dexamethasone 4 mg IV
   Q12H yesterday (will need 2 wk taper).
   .
   # PNA - Patient with both a post-obstructive RUL and likely LLL PNA.
   Given her steroid usage, concern re: immunosuppression.  Patient was
   noted to  have thrush in airway.
   - fup BAL cultures, blood cx
   - continue zosyn, cipro, vancomycin and fluconazole for now.  narrow as
   able.
   -On bactrim prophylaxis
   - ID consult appreciated.
   .
   # NSCLC - Decadron use was possibly part of her chemotherapy regimen.
   Unknown duration of steroid therapy
   - decadron as above; bactrim ppx
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia - most likely secondary to recent
   chemotherapy.
   - continue to monitor
   -note, getting heparin TID and  heparin flushes
   .
   # FEN: IVF bolus as above, TF, replete electrolytes
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI, bowel reg.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. The patient has been intubated for airway protection and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.3°F
* Heart rate: 97 bpm
* Blood pressure: 105/52 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 93%

The patient has a history of recent chemotherapy, which may be contributing to her thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 93) and anemia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.8 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 7.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 93 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 30 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: sodium 139 mEq/L, potassium 4.7 mEq/L, chloride 103 mEq/L

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: extensive right mid and upper lung consolidation consistent with post-obstructive pneumonia/atelectasis
* Computed tomography (CT) scan: diffuse lung nodularity may represent metastatic spread, and/or superimposed infection

The patient's respiratory culture results show:

* Gram-negative rods: >100,000 organisms/mL
* Yeast: 10,000-100,000 organisms/mL
* Legionella culture: negative

The patient's acid-fast smear and culture results are negative.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure: continue mechanical ventilation, increase PEEP to 12, and follow ABGs.
* Hypotension: likely sepsis, fluid bolus to keep mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60, wean sedation as possible, and continue steroids.
* Pneumonia: follow BAL cultures, blood cultures, and continue antibiotic therapy.
* NSCLC: continue chemotherapy regimen, including decadron.
* Anemia and thrombocytopenia: monitor and continue to manage.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Sepsis: the patient's hypotension and fever suggest a possible septic episode, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
* Respiratory failure: the patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and her oxygen saturation is decreased, which can lead to respiratory failure and require further interventions.
* Pneumonia: the patient's respiratory culture results show a high colony count of gram-negative rods, which can lead to further respiratory complications.
* Anemia and thrombocytopenia: the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia can lead to bleeding and infection complications.
* Cancer progression: the patient's NSCLC can progress and spread to other parts of the body, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life.

Based on this information, it is recommended that the patient continue to receive close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiovascular, and hematological status. Further interventions, such as antibiotic therapy and chemotherapy, may be necessary to manage her pneumonia and cancer."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia and respiratory failure. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 101.3°F (38.5°C)
* Heart rate: 92 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 119/58 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 90%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.8 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 7.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 93 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 30 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: Na+ 139 mmol/L, K+ 4.7 mmol/L, Cl- 103 mmol/L
* Glucose: 159 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
* Multilobar pneumonia
* Hypotension (not shock)
* Electrolyte and fluid disorder, other
* Cancer (malignant neoplasm), lung

The patient's medications include:

* Ciprofloxacin
* Piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn)
* Vancomycin
* Fentanyl
* Midazolam (Versed)
* Heparin sodium (prophylaxis)
* Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and Zosyn
* Taper steroids
* Hold chemotherapy
* Decrease tidal volumes and increase respiratory rate to meet 6cc/kg
* Try to come down on FIO2

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which can worsen if not properly managed.
* Pneumonia: The patient has multilobar pneumonia, which can lead to further complications such as sepsis, respiratory failure, and death.
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not properly managed.
* Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications if not properly managed.
* Cancer progression: The patient has NSCLC, which can progress and worsen if not properly managed.
* Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to her immunocompromised state and the use of antibiotics.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 53 yo with recent diagnosis of NSCLC who
   presented to OSH with pneumonia.  Y-stent was removed yesterday,
   transferred to the ICU team for further management.
   .
   # Respiratory failure - intubated for airway protection in preparation
   for her bronchoscopy and stent removal.  Given her substantial
   pneumonia she was not able to be extubated post-procedure
   -continue broad spectrum abx, fluconazole
   - started bactrim ppx
   - continue mechanical ventilation - A/C switch to ardsnet settings
   yesterday, trying to titrate RR, PEEP, FiO2 to pCO2 of 60 and pO2 of 60
   or >
   - follow ABGs.
   .
   # Hypotension - likely sepsis, initially thought to be possible adrenal
   insufficiency, having been on steroids recently.
   - fluid bolus to keep MAP>65, has not yet required pressors
   - wean sedation as possible.
   - continue steroids -switched from hydrocort to Dexamethasone 4 mg IV
   Q12H 2 days ago (will need 2 wk taper).
   .
   # PNA - Patient with both a post-obstructive RUL and likely LLL PNA.
   Given her steroid usage, concern re: immunosuppression.  Patient was
   noted to  have thrush in airway.
   -+/- therapeutic bronch; unclear how much this will help; not possible

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the emergency department with pneumonia. She was intubated for airway protection and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of steroid use, which may have contributed to her immunosuppression. She has developed respiratory failure, hypotension, and impaired skin integrity, including round ulcers concerning for herpes simplex virus (HSV) on her bottom.

Assessment:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation to manage her respiratory failure. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 49 mmHg, and PaO2 of 63 mmHg.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 88/49 mmHg, and she has received a fluid bolus to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has developed round ulcers concerning for HSV on her bottom.
4. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 3.9 mmol/L, sodium level of 136 mmol/L, and chloride level of 98 mmol/L.
5. Cancer: The patient has a diagnosis of NSCLC, which may have contributed to her immunosuppression.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if her ventilation settings are not optimized or if she develops a secondary infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if she develops sepsis or if her fluid bolus is not effective in maintaining her blood pressure.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may worsen if her ulcers become infected or if she develops a secondary skin condition.
4. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's electrolyte and fluid disorder may worsen if her electrolyte levels are not monitored and replaced as needed.
5. Cancer: The patient's cancer may progress if she does not receive appropriate treatment, which may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her ventilation settings as needed to optimize her oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust her fluid management plan as needed to maintain a MAP of 65 mmHg.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's skin integrity and treat her ulcers with antibiotics and wound care as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and replace as needed to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
5. Consider consulting with an oncologist to discuss the patient's cancer treatment options and develop a plan for her care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. She underwent a Y-stent removal yesterday and was transferred to the ICU for further management.

The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and is receiving mechanical ventilation with an arterial blood gas (ABG) result of 7.47/49/63. She is hypotensive with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg, and her heart rate is 93 beats per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 90% on 65% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2).

The patient has a history of recent chemotherapy, which may have contributed to her anemia and thrombocytopenia. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), as well as antifungal medication, fluconazole.

The patient has a diagnosis of respiratory failure, acute, not ARDS, and is being treated with an ARDSnet protocol. She is also being treated for hypotension, likely secondary to sepsis, and is receiving fluid boluses to maintain a MAP greater than 65 mmHg.

The patient has a diagnosis of impaired skin integrity, with round ulcers concerning for herpes simplex virus (HSV) on her bottom. She is being treated with antiviral medication and may require further treatment.

The patient's electrolyte and fluid disorder is being managed with intravenous fluids and electrolyte supplementation. Her anemia and thrombocytopenia are being monitored, and she is receiving prophylactic anticoagulation with subcutaneous heparin.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a diagnosis of pneumonia, which may progress or develop further complications, such as sepsis or respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to her pneumonia, hypotension, and immunosuppression.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, but may require further management or intervention to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has an electrolyte and fluid disorder, which may require further management and monitoring to prevent complications.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may lead to further complications, such as infection or skin breakdown.
6. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which may require further management and monitoring to prevent complications.
7. Immunosuppression: The patient is immunosuppressed due to her chemotherapy and steroid therapy, which may increase her risk of infection and other complications.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is recommended that she continue to receive close monitoring and management in the ICU, with regular assessments of her respiratory, cardiovascular, and electrolyte status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. She was intubated for airway protection and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with ARDSnet settings.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with ARDSnet settings to manage her pneumonia.
* Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, likely due to sepsis, and has received fluid boluses to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. She has not yet required pressors.
* Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has an electrolyte and fluid disorder, which is likely secondary to her pneumonia and fluid resuscitation.
* Impaired skin integrity: The patient has round ulcers on her bottom, which are concerning for herpes simplex virus (HSV).
* Cancer: The patient has NSCLC, which is being treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
* Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are likely secondary to her recent chemotherapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia can worsen, leading to further respiratory failure and the need for increased ventilatory support.
* Sepsis: The patient's sepsis can progress, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
* Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's electrolyte and fluid disorder can worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
* Impaired skin integrity: The patient's round ulcers on her bottom can become infected, leading to further complications.
* Cancer progression: The patient's NSCLC can progress, leading to further complications and potentially affecting her quality of life.
* Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia can worsen, leading to further complications and potentially affecting her quality of life.

To manage these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored for signs of respiratory failure, sepsis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, impaired skin integrity, cancer progression, and anemia and thrombocytopenia. The patient should also receive appropriate treatment for her pneumonia, including antibiotics and respiratory support."

   for her bronchoscopy and stent removal.  Given her substantial
   pneumonia she was not able to be extubated post-procedure
   -continue broad spectrum abx.
   - started bactrim ppx given steroids treatment.
   - continue mechanical ventilation - A/C switch to ardsnet settings
   yesterday, trying to titrate RR, PEEP, FiO2 to pCO2 of 60 and pO2 of 60

   - follow ABGs.
   -follow ID recs.
   -start caspafungin, DC fluconazole.
   -consider balloon placement if continued difficulty ventilating.
   .
   # Hypotension - likely sepsis, initially thought to be possible adrenal
   insufficiency, having been on steroids recently.
   - fluid bolus to keep MAP>65, has not yet required pressors.
   - wean sedation as possible.  Increased yesterday due to dyssynchrony,
   but reduced slightly overnight.
   - continue steroids - currently Dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q12H 2 days ago
   (will need 2 wk taper).
   - will reduce today
 4 mg Qam, 2 mg Qpm, then plan for 2 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   tomorrow.

   # PNA - Patient with both a post-obstructive RUL and likely LLL PNA.
   Given her steroid usage, concern re: immunosuppression.  Patient was
   noted to  have thrush in airway.
   -+/- therapeutic bronch; unclear how much this will help; not possible
   to do any stenting to relieve obstruction
   - fup BAL cultures, blood cx
   - continue zosyn, cipro, vancomycin and fluconazole for now.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   able to d/c fluc as starting caspo

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia and was intubated for airway protection. She was previously treated with steroids, which may have contributed to her immunosuppressed state.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Respiratory failure, with mechanical ventilation and A/C switch to ARDSnet settings
* Hypotension, likely due to sepsis or possible adrenal insufficiency
* Impaired skin integrity, with round ulcers concerning for herpes simplex virus (HSV) on her bottom
* Electrolyte and fluid disorder, with fluid boluses administered to maintain MAP > 65
* Anemia and thrombocytopenia, likely secondary to recent chemotherapy
* Presence of thrush in her airway, which may be related to immunosuppression

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
* Start caspofungin for fungal pneumonia
* Wean sedation as possible, with increased RR and PEEP to improve oxygenation
* Reduce steroid dosage and taper over the next two weeks
* Continue mechanical ventilation and monitor ABGs
* Follow ID recommendations and consider balloon placement if continued difficulty ventilating

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening respiratory failure, leading to further hypoxia and hypercapnia
* Development of sepsis or septic shock
* Progression of skin ulcers, potentially leading to wound infection or sepsis
* Further decline in hemoglobin and platelet count, potentially leading to bleeding or anemia
* Fungal pneumonia progression, potentially leading to dissemination and sepsis
* Development of electrolyte imbalances, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications and improve her overall outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia and respiratory failure. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure, acute, with multilobar pneumonia and hypoxemia
* Mild hypotension, responsive to fluid bolus and sedation
* Fever
* Anemia
* Respiratory support with mechanical ventilation, with a tidal volume of 340 mL and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute
* Oxygen delivery device: endotracheal tube
* Ventilator mode: CMV/ASSIST/AUTOFLOW
* PEEP: 14 cmH2O
* FiO2: 65%

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

* Respiratory failure can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can further complicate the patient's condition.
* Hypotension can lead to shock, which can result in multi-organ failure.
* Anemia can lead to decreased oxygen delivery to the tissues, which can worsen the patient's respiratory failure.
* Pneumonia can lead to sepsis, which can cause organ dysfunction and failure.
* Cancer can spread to other parts of the body, leading to metastasis and further complicating the patient's condition.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Respiratory support with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy
* Antibiotics for pneumonia
* Fluid management to manage hypotension
* Sedation to maintain patient comfort and reduce stress
* Nutrition support with enteral feeding
* Glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer
* VAP prevention with HOB elevation, mouth care, and RSBI.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU."

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 53 yo with recent diagnosis of NSCLC who
   presented to OSH with pneumonia.  Y-stent was removed yesterday,
   transferred to the ICU team for further management.
   .
   # Respiratory failure - intubated for airway protection in preparation
   for her bronchoscopy and stent removal.  Given her substantial
   pneumonia she was not able to be extubated post-procedure
   -continue broad spectrum abx.
   - started bactrim ppx given steroids treatment.
   - continue mechanical ventilation - A/C switch to ardsnet settings
   yesterday, trying to titrate RR, PEEP, FiO2 to pCO2 of 60 and pO2 of 60
   or >
   - follow ABGs.
   -follow ID recs.
   -start caspafungin, DC fluconazole.
   -consider balloon placement if continued difficulty ventilating.
   .
   # Hypotension - likely sepsis, initially thought to be possible adrenal
   insufficiency, having been on steroids recently.
   - fluid bolus to keep MAP>65, has not yet required pressors.
   - wean sedation as possible.  Increased yesterday due to dyssynchrony,
   but reduced slightly overnight.
   - continue steroids - currently Dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q12H 2 days ago
   (will need 2 wk taper).
   - will reduce today
 4 mg Qam, 2 mg Qpm, then plan for 2 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   tomorrow.
   .
   # PNA - Patient with both a post-obstructive RUL and likely LLL PNA.
   Given her steroid usage, concern re: immunosuppression.  Patient was
   noted to  have thrush in airway.
   -+/- therapeutic bronch; unclear how much this will help; not possible
   to do any stenting to relieve obstruction
   - fup BAL cultures, blood cx
   - continue zosyn, cipro, vancomycin and fluconazole for now.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   able to d/c fluc as starting caspo
   -will start  caspo for fungal pna (the tree in [**Male First Name (un) **] part, not the

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. She was intubated for airway protection and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, and blood pressure of 111/62 mmHg. Her respiratory status is being closely monitored, with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient has a history of recent chemotherapy and steroid use, which may have contributed to her immunosuppressed state and increased risk of infection. She has been diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. Additionally, she has been prescribed antifungal medication to prevent invasive fungal disease.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia and thrombocytopenia, which may be secondary to recent chemotherapy. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and her liver function tests are slightly elevated.

The patient's skin integrity is impaired, and she has a history of thrush in her airway. She has also been diagnosed with perianal ulcers, which may be related to her immunosuppressed state.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and she is at risk for respiratory failure due to her pneumonia and immunosuppressed state.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is a significant concern, and she may be at risk for further complications if her infection is not effectively managed.
3. Invasive fungal disease: The patient's immunosuppressed state and recent chemotherapy make her at risk for invasive fungal disease, which can be life-threatening.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is being treated with antibiotics, but she may be at risk for further complications if her infection is not effectively managed.
5. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may be secondary to recent chemotherapy, and she may be at risk for further complications if her blood counts do not improve.
6. Skin integrity issues: The patient's impaired skin integrity may put her at risk for further complications, such as skin breakdown and infection.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications. Her care should be individualized based on her specific needs and risk factors."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   # Respiratory failure - intubated for airway protection in preparation
   for her bronchoscopy and stent removal.  Given her substantial
   pneumonia she was not able to be extubated post-procedure
   -continue broad spectrum abx.
   - started bactrim ppx given steroids treatment.

   - follow ABGs.
   -follow ID recs.
   -start caspafungin, DC fluconazole.
   -consider balloon placement if continued difficulty ventilating.
   .
   # Hypotension - likely sepsis, initially thought to be possible adrenal
   insufficiency, having been on steroids recently.
   - fluid bolus to keep MAP>65, has not yet required pressors.
   - wean sedation as possible.  Increased yesterday due to dyssynchrony,
   but reduced slightly overnight.
   - continue steroids - currently Dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q12H 2 days ago
   (will need 2 wk taper).
   - will reduce today
 4 mg Qam, 2 mg Qpm, then plan for 2 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   tomorrow.

   # PNA - Patient with both a post-obstructive RUL and likely LLL PNA.
   Given her steroid usage, concern re: immunosuppression.  Patient was
   noted to  have thrush in airway.
   -+/- therapeutic bronch; unclear how much this will help; not possible
   to do any stenting to relieve obstruction

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure.

The patient has a history of chemotherapy, which may have contributed to her anemia and thrombocytopenia. She is also receiving steroids as part of her chemotherapy regimen, which may have contributed to her immunosuppression and increased risk of infection.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a severe bacterial pneumonia, which is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis due to her pneumonia and hypotension.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be due to sepsis or adrenal insufficiency.
5. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely secondary to her recent chemotherapy.
6. Immunosuppression: The patient's immunosuppression may be due to her chemotherapy and steroid use.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation increases her risk of developing VAP.
2. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury or liver failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, requiring more aggressive respiratory support.
4. Invasive fungal disease: The patient's immunosuppression and prolonged hospitalization increase her risk of developing invasive fungal disease.
5. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's hypotension may be due to adrenal insufficiency, which would require immediate attention.
6. Electrolyte and fluid disorders: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and fluid management may lead to electrolyte and fluid disorders.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia
2. Mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure
3. Fluid boluses to maintain blood pressure
4. Steroids to treat adrenal insufficiency and immunosuppression
5. Caspofungin to prevent invasive fungal disease
6. Monitoring of electrolyte and fluid levels
7. ID consult to optimize antibiotic therapy
8. Palliative care and social work consultation for patient and family support."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. She was intubated for airway protection and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, but there is a risk of continued respiratory failure or development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Sepsis: The patient has septic shock and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a risk of continued sepsis and development of multi-organ failure.
3. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension and is receiving fluid boluses to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. There is a risk of continued hypotension and development of shock.
4. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has an electrolyte and fluid disorder, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
5. Cancer progression: The patient has NSCLC, and there is a risk of cancer progression and metastasis.
6. Immunosuppression: The patient is receiving steroids and has a history of chemotherapy, which can lead to immunosuppression and increased risk of infections.
7. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, and there is a risk of continued pneumonia and development of respiratory failure.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage.
9. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can increase the risk of fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
10. Wound infection: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of wound infection and development of sepsis.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Mechanical ventilation
2. Broad-spectrum antibiotics
3. Steroids
4. Fluid boluses
5. Electrolyte and fluid management
6. Cancer treatment (chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy)
7. Immunomodulation therapy
8. Pneumonia treatment (antibiotics and/or bronchoscopy)
9. Thrombocytopenia management (platelet transfusions and/or medications)
10. Anemia management (blood transfusions and/or medications)

The patient's code status is full, and she is currently in the ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. She was intubated for airway protection and is currently in the ICU. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with worsening left-sided infiltrates on chest X-ray, concerning for infection, carcinomatosis, or fluid overload. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, and diuretics to manage fluid overload. The patient has a history of steroid use, which may have contributed to her immunosuppression.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's condition is worsening, and sepsis is a significant concern. The patient's temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure are all elevated, which may indicate sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which may not be sufficient to manage her respiratory failure. The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 102, which is below the normal range.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient is receiving diuretics to manage fluid overload, which may not be effective in managing her condition.
4. Immunocompromise: The patient's immunosuppression may increase her risk of infection and sepsis.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 136, which is below the normal range. This may increase her risk of bleeding.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 7.4 g/dL, which is below the normal range. This may increase her risk of fatigue and shortness of breath.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
8. Infection: The patient's sputum culture shows growth of Gram-negative rods, which may indicate a bacterial infection.
9. Cancer Progression: The patient's NSCLC may be progressing, which may increase her risk of respiratory failure and sepsis.
10. Perianal Ulcers: The patient's perianal ulcers may be a sign of HSV infection, which may increase her risk of sepsis and other complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to manage the patient's infection.
2. Consider switching to caspofungin and discontinuing fluconazole based on the patient's sputum culture results.
3. Continue mechanical ventilation and titrate the patient's respiratory support to achieve a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 300.
4. Monitor the patient's fluid status and adjust her diuretic regimen as needed.
5. Consider consulting with an infectious disease specialist to manage the patient's immunocompromise and infection.
6. Monitor the patient's platelet count and hemoglobin level and consider transfusions as necessary.
7. Consider consulting with a pulmonologist to manage the patient's respiratory failure and NSCLC.
8. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her electrolyte replacement regimen as necessary.
9. Consider consulting with a dermatologist to manage the patient's perianal ulcers and HSV infection."

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 53 yo with recent diagnosis of NSCLC who
   presented to OSH with pneumonia.  Y-stent was removed and patient was
   transferred to the ICU team for further management.
   # Respiratory failure - intubated for airway protection in preparation
   for her bronchoscopy and stent removal.  Given her substantial
   pneumonia she was not able to be extubated post-procedure.   Patient
   continues to deteriorate with CXR demonstrating worsening left sided
   infiltrates concerning for infection vs. carcinomatosis vs. fluid
   overload.
   - continue broad spectrum abx.
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis given ongoing steroid treatments for
   cancer diagnosis
   - continue mechanical ventilation titrate RR, PEEP, FiO2 to goal of
   pCO2 60 and pO2  > / = 60
   - follow ABGs.
   -will start caspafungin, and dc fluconazole per ID recs.
   -will give Lasix 20 mg IV in hopes to diurese fluid from lungs if
   picture of pulmonary edema
   -will defer balloon placement considering asymmetry of air space
   disease between lung fields
   .
   # Hypotension
 likely related to sepsis with post-obstructive
   pneumonia as source
   - will continue fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65
   - continue steroids - Dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q12H 2 days ago (will need
   2 wk taper).
   - will reduce today
 2 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # PNA - Patient with both a post-obstructive RUL and likely LLL PNA.
   Given her steroid usage, concern re: immunosuppression.  Patient was
   also noted to have thrush in airway.
   -
   +/- therapeutic bronch; unclear how much this will help; not possible
   to do any stenting to relieve obstruction
   - fup BAL cultures, blood cx
   - continue zosyn, cipro, vancomycin and micafungin and bactrim
   prophylaxis given immunosuppresion
   - consult with ID regarding possible treatment for HSV pneumonia
   considering appearance of perianal ulcers
   .
   # Perianal Ulcers
   - consider ulcer Cx for HSV
   .
   # NSCLC - Decadron use was possibly part of her chemotherapy regimen.
   Unknown duration of steroid therapy
   - decadron as above; bactrim ppx
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia - most likely secondary to recent
   chemotherapy.
   - continue to monitor
   -note, getting heparin TID and  heparin flushes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Ms. [**Known lastname 4443**] is a 53 year-old female with a recent
   diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer with post obstructive PNA .
   24 Hour Events:
   Multiple readjustments of ventilator settings for frequent de-sats to
   high 80
s, PEEP increased to 18 at midnight, now with stable sats in
   mid 90
s, RR increased to 28 and FIO2 decreased to 90 %
   Gave Lasix 20 mg IV with good UOP in setting of elevated BNP to 413
   Vancomycin was DC
d per ID
   Palliative care consult suggests XRT may be an option for treatment of
   malignant airway obstruction, as chemo is not an option given severity
   of illness.  Will meet with family daily to discuss goals of care.
   Perianal ulcers cultures for HSV

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health status and potential medical complications:

**Current Health Status:**

* The patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer with post-obstructive pneumonia.
* She is intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure.
* She has a history of chemotherapy, which may have contributed to her anemia and thrombocytopenia.
* She has perianal ulcers and is at risk for infection, including HSV pneumonia.
* She has a history of immunosuppression due to steroid usage.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, with worsening left-sided infiltrates on CXR. She may require further interventions, such as bronchoscopy and stenting, to relieve obstruction.
2. **Sepsis:** The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to her post-obstructive pneumonia and immunosuppression. She may require broad-spectrum antibiotics and aggressive fluid management.
3. **Pulmonary Edema:** The patient has a high risk of developing pulmonary edema due to her respiratory failure and fluid overload.
4. **Infection:** The patient has a high risk of developing infections, including pneumonia, due to her immunosuppression and presence of perianal ulcers.
5. **Hypotension:** The patient has a history of hypotension, which may be related to sepsis or fluid overload.
6. **Anemia and Thrombocytopenia:** The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may worsen due to her ongoing chemotherapy and immunosuppression.
7. **Cancer Progression:** The patient's cancer may continue to progress, potentially leading to further respiratory failure and decreased quality of life.

**Interventions and Plan:**

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat post-obstructive pneumonia.
2. Titrate mechanical ventilation to maintain optimal respiratory function.
3. Monitor and manage fluid overload to prevent pulmonary edema.
4. Consider therapeutic bronchoscopy to relieve obstruction.
5. Continue immunosuppressive therapy, including steroids and chemotherapy.
6. Monitor and manage anemia and thrombocytopenia.
7. Consider palliative care consult to discuss goals of care and potential treatment options."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA). The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has been experiencing frequent desaturations, requiring adjustments to ventilator settings, and has been treated with Lasix for fluid overload.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 102/60 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 94%.

The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, and her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but she has anemia and thrombocytopenia, likely secondary to recent chemotherapy.

The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Zosyn, Cipro, Vancomycin, and Micafungin, as well as antifungal medication, Caspafungin. She has also been given Lasix for fluid overload and Dexamethasone for sepsis.

The patient's respiratory status is a concern, with worsening left-sided infiltrates on chest X-ray, which may be due to infection, carcinomatosis, or fluid overload. The patient's oxygenation is compromised, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 98.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may require further interventions to improve oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, and her laboratory results show evidence of infection. She may require further antibiotic therapy and supportive care.
3. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may worsen if she continues to experience bleeding or infection.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but she may require further monitoring and correction if her electrolyte levels become imbalanced.
5. Pneumonia: The patient has a diagnosis of PNA, and her chest X-ray shows worsening infiltrates. She may require further antibiotic therapy and supportive care.
6. Cancer progression: The patient has a diagnosis of NSCLC, and her disease may continue to progress, requiring further treatment and management.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # Respiratory failure
 patient continues to deteriorate with CXR
   demonstrating worsening left sided infiltrates concerning for infection
   vs. hemorrhage vs. carcinomatosis vs. fluid overload
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics given prior gram [**Last Name (LF) 411**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] add
   IV bactim 320 mg IV q8H given + culture for stenotrophomonas
   - continue mechanical ventilation and titrate RR, PEEP, FiO2 to goal of
   pCO2 60 and pO2  > / = 60
   - follow up serial ABG
   - will consider balloon placement considering developing bilateral air
   space disease to identify optimal PEEP
   - will defer bronchoscopy for now as patient remains tenuous on current
   Vent settings
   - will continue to follow serial hematocrits to exclude pulmonary
   hemorrhage - stable
   # Hypotension
 likely related to sepsis with post-obstructive
   pneumonia as source

   # PNA
 patient with post-obstructive RUL and now worsening airspace
   disease throughout left lung field likely representing spread of
   infection.  Patient was also noted initially to have thrush in mouth at
   intubation in the setting of steroid therapy for her cancer diagnosis.
   - will continue broad spectrum antibiotics pending cultures (estimated
   2-3 days) and add IV bactrim for culture + stenotrophomonas, will
   continue antifungal coverage with micafungin given appearance of thrush
   and immunosuppresion.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer and post-obstructive pneumonia. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with frequent desaturations, which has led to adjustments in ventilator settings. She has been experiencing respiratory failure, hypotension, and septic shock, which is likely related to her underlying cancer and post-obstructive pneumonia. She also has perianal ulcers and is at risk for electrolyte and fluid disorders.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status continues to deteriorate, with worsening left-sided infiltrates on CXR. She may require further adjustments in ventilator settings, including the consideration of balloon placement to identify optimal PEEP.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is likely related to her post-obstructive pneumonia and may require further management, including the addition of IV bactrim and continued broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Electrolyte and fluid disorders: The patient's electrolyte and fluid status is unstable, with concerns about fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances. She may require further fluid management and electrolyte repletion.
4. Perianal ulcers: The patient's perianal ulcers are likely related to her immunosuppression and may require further management, including wound care and antibiotic coverage.
5. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely secondary to her recent chemotherapy and may require further management, including blood transfusions and platelet support.
6. Cancer progression: The patient's cancer is likely to progress, and she may require further management, including XRT and chemotherapy.
7. Infection control: The patient is at risk for further infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia and sepsis, which may require further management and prevention strategies.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings as necessary.
2. Manage the patient's septic shock with IV fluids, vasopressors, and antibiotics.
3. Replete electrolytes and fluids as necessary to prevent electrolyte and fluid disorders.
4. Continue to manage the patient's perianal ulcers with wound care and antibiotic coverage.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia and provide further management as necessary.
6. Consider XRT and chemotherapy for the patient's cancer.
7. Implement infection control measures, including ventilator-associated pneumonia and sepsis prevention strategies."

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 53 yo with recent diagnosis of NSCLC who
   presented to OSH with pneumonia.  Y-stent was removed and patient was
   transferred to the ICU team for further management.
   # Respiratory failure - intubated for airway protection in preparation
   for her bronchoscopy and stent removal.  Given her substantial
   pneumonia she was not able to be extubated post-procedure.   Patient
   continues to deteriorate with CXR demonstrating worsening left sided
   infiltrates concerning for infection vs. carcinomatosis vs. fluid
   overload.
   - continue broad spectrum abx.
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis given ongoing steroid treatments for
   cancer diagnosis
   - continue mechanical ventilation titrate RR, PEEP, FiO2 to goal of
   pCO2 60 and pO2  > / = 60
   - follow ABGs.
   - f/u CXR post diuresis, consider additional Lasix if interval
   improvement from yesterday
   - will defer balloon placement considering asymmetry of air space
   disease between lung fields
   - consider bronchoscopy if continued de-sats to exclude diffuse
   pulmonary hemorrhage
   - follow serial hemoatocrits to exclude pulmonary hemorrhage
 will
   consider bronchoscopy if continued de-sats
   # Hypotension
 likely related to sepsis with post-obstructive
   pneumonia as source
   - will continue fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65
   - continue steroids - Dexamethasone 2 mg IV BID to complete  2 wk taper
   # PNA - Patient with both a post-obstructive RUL and likely LLL PNA.
   Given her steroid usage, concern re: immunosuppression.  Patient was
   also noted to have thrush in airway.
   +/- therapeutic bronch; unclear how much this will help; not possible
   to do any stenting to relieve obstruction
   - fup BAL cultures, blood cx
   - continue zosyn, cipro, and micafungin and bactrim prophylaxis given
   immunosuppresion, vancomycin discontinued as no indication for MRSA and
   zosyn will cover other G+ organisms.
   - consult with ID regarding possible treatment for HSV pneumonia
   considering appearance of perianal ulcers
   .
   # Perianal Ulcers

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint: Ms. [**Known lastname 4443**] is a 53 year-old female with a recent
   diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer with post obstructive PNA .
   24 Hour Events:
   Multiple readjustments of ventilator settings for frequent de-sats to
   high 80

Summary:

The patient, a 53-year-old female, is a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer with post-obstructive pneumonia. She was intubated for airway protection and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. Her condition has been deteriorating, with worsening left-sided infiltrates on chest X-ray, likely due to infection, carcinomatosis, or fluid overload. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and has been started on steroids for her cancer diagnosis.

The patient has several potential complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, likely due to sepsis and post-obstructive pneumonia.
3. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and she has been receiving fluid boluses to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has perianal ulcers, which are pending culture results.
5. Cancer: The patient has a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer, which is a significant risk factor for complications.
6. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely secondary to recent chemotherapy.
7. Infection: The patient has a positive sputum culture for Stenotrophomonas, which is sensitive to Bactrim.
8. Fluid overload: The patient has a high fluid intake and output, which may be contributing to her hypotension and electrolyte imbalance.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and electrolyte imbalance may be indicative of sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not adequately managed, leading to respiratory arrest.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen if not adequately treated, leading to further respiratory failure and sepsis.
4. Cancer progression: The patient's cancer may progress if not adequately treated, leading to further complications and poor outcomes.
5. Infection: The patient's infection may spread to other parts of the body if not adequately treated, leading to further complications.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may worsen if not adequately managed, leading to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
7. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload may worsen if not adequately managed, leading to further complications such as pulmonary edema and cardiac failure.

In conclusion, the patient is at high risk for several potential complications, including sepsis, respiratory failure, pneumonia, cancer progression, infection, electrolyte imbalance, and fluid overload. Close monitoring and aggressive management of these complications are essential to improve the patient's outcomes."

   diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer who admitted to OSH on [**7-27**] for
   dyspnea for 1-2 days PTA.  In addition, she reported increased
   respiratory secretions, fevers and chills.  At OSH, she was found to
   have PNA and there was concern about a possible stent obstruction so
   she was transferred to BICMC on [**7-29**] for urgent bronchscopy and stent
   evaluation.  On [**7-29**] she underwent rigid bronchoscopy and it was found
   that her y-stent migrated so it was removed was removed.  She was noted
   to have thrush in her trachea.  She was intubated for the procedure and
   it was decided to keep the patient ventillated post-bronch given the
   severity of her PNA.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Ms. [**Known lastname 4443**] is a 53 year-old female with a recent
   diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer who admitted to OSH on [**7-27**] for
   dyspnea for 1-2 days PTA.  In addition, she reported increased
   respiratory secretions, fevers and chills.  At OSH, she was found to
   have PNA and there was concern about a possible stent obstruction so
   she was transferred to BICMC on [**7-29**] for urgent bronchscopy and stent
   evaluation.  On [**7-29**] she underwent rigid bronchoscopy and it was found
   that her y-stent migrated so it was removed was removed.  She was noted
   to have thrush in her trachea.  She was intubated for the procedure and
   it was decided to keep the patient ventillated post-bronch given the
   severity of her PNA.

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia, dyspnea, and respiratory secretions. She underwent rigid bronchoscopy and stent removal, and was intubated for airway protection. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with worsening left-sided infiltrates on CXR, concerning for infection, carcinomatosis, or fluid overload.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock due to her pneumonia and post-obstructive pneumonia.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, likely related to sepsis and post-obstructive pneumonia.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has both right upper lobe (RUL) and left lower lobe (LLL) pneumonia, and is at risk for immunosuppression due to her steroid usage.
5. Perianal ulcers: The patient has perianal ulcers, which may be related to herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection.
6. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely secondary to recent chemotherapy.
7. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has an electrolyte and fluid disorder, which may be related to her pneumonia and sepsis.

The patient is receiving various treatments, including:

1. Broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat her pneumonia.
2. Mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation.
3. Fluid boluses to maintain blood pressure.
4. Steroids to reduce inflammation.
5. Heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis.
6. Antifungal medication to treat possible fungal infections.
7. Proton pump inhibitors to prevent stress ulcers.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is currently ICU care."

Summary:

The patient, a 53-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for further management after presenting with pneumonia. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with worsening left-sided infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting infection, hemorrhage, carcinomatosis, or fluid overload. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including IV bactrim, and antifungal coverage with micafungin due to the presence of thrush in her mouth.

The patient has several comorbidities, including anemia and thrombocytopenia likely secondary to recent chemotherapy, as well as impaired skin integrity and electrolyte and fluid disorder. She is being managed with mechanical ventilation, with goals of pCO2 60 and pO2 >= 60. Her code status is ""full"" with discussion with her sister regarding goals of care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening respiratory failure may lead to further decline in her condition, requiring increased support or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock may worsen, leading to organ dysfunction and potential mortality.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may spread to other areas of her lungs, leading to further respiratory compromise.
4. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's electrolyte and fluid disorder may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or even cardiac arrest.
5. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to bleeding or hemorrhage.
6. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may lead to further skin breakdown and potential sepsis.
7. Cancer Progression: The patient's NSCLC may progress, leading to further respiratory compromise and potential mortality.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal coverage.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilation settings as necessary.
3. Consider balloon placement to optimize PEEP.
4. Continue to follow serial hematocrits to exclude pulmonary hemorrhage.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte and fluid status closely and adjust management as necessary.
6. Continue to manage the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia with serial transfusions and platelet support.
7. Monitor the patient's skin integrity closely and consider wound care and dressing changes as necessary.
8. Continue to follow the patient's cancer treatment plan, including tapering steroids and deferring radiation therapy until further notice."

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 53 yo w/ recent dx of NSCLC who
   presented to OSH with pneumonia.  Y-stent removed and patient was
   transferred to ICU for further management.
   # Respiratory failure
 patient continues to deteriorate with CXR
   demonstrating worsening left sided infiltrates concerning for infection
   vs. hemorrhage vs. carcinomatosis vs. fluid overload
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics given prior gram stain, and
   continue IV bactim 320 mg IV q8H given + culture for stenotrophomonas
   - will f/u pan Cx drawn [**8-4**] and consider re-adding Vancomycin
   considering fever spike s/p D/C on [**8-3**] and jump in WBC from 10 to 17
   - continue mechanical ventilation and titrate RR, PEEP, FiO2 to goal of
   pCO2 60 and pO2  > / = 60
   - continue to follow serial ABG
   - will consider balloon placement considering developing bilateral air
   space disease to identify optimal PEEP
   - will continue to follow serial hematocrits to exclude pulmonary
   hemorrhage - stable
   # Hypotension
 likely related to sepsis with post-obstructive
   pneumonia as source
   - patient has remained stable and has not required pressors, will bolus
   PRN to maintain MAP > 65
   # PNA
 patient with post-obstructive RUL and now worsening airspace
   disease throughout left lung field likely representing spread of
   infection.  Patient was also noted initially to have thrush in mouth at
   intubation in the setting of steroid therapy for her cancer diagnosis.
   - will continue broad spectrum antibiotics pending cultures (estimated
   2-3 days) and IV bactrim for culture + stenotrophomonas, will continue
   antifungal coverage with micafungin given appearance of thrush and
   immunosuppresion.
   - will consider adding Vancomycin given fever spikes s/p DC on [**8-3**] and
   bump in WBC counts
   .
   # Perianal Ulcers
   -  f/u wound Cx for HSV - pending
   # NSCLC
 patient was receiving decadron initially for airway
   inflammation now on vent
   - decadron to be tapered over 2 weeks, now 2 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
 may consider
   changing to 1.5 mg AM and 2 mg PM
   - XRT to be deferred for now as peritracheal mass in RUL may lead to
   more disseminate infection and worsening clinical picture, also patient
   may not be able to tolerate transport out of the MICU at this time
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia - most likely secondary to recent
   chemotherapy.
   - will continue serial HCT to monitor for hemorrhage - stable
   .
   # FEN: IVF bolus as above, TF, replete electrolytes, increase SS to
   maintain sugars < 200, may consider diuresis today considering 2 L

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Ms. [**Known lastname 4443**] is a 53 year-old female with a recent
   diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer now with post-obstructive
   pneumonia and worsening bilateral airspace disease.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient spiked fever to 101.4 and blood / urine  / sputum cultures
   obtained in setting of discontinuing Vancomycin on [**8-3**].  WBC count
   jumped to 17 from 10.8.
   - Patient code status DNR s/p family meeting yesterday
   - Palliative care may be used during family meetings [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2377**]

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and post-obstructive pneumonia. She has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for further management.

The patient has shown significant deterioration, with worsening bilateral airspace disease, hypercapnic respiratory failure, and septic shock. Her blood cultures, sputum Gram stain, and urine culture are pending, but the sputum Gram stain shows > 25 polymorphonuclear cells, 2+ Gram-negative rods, and 1+ budding yeast.

The patient has a history of chemotherapy, which may have contributed to her anemia and thrombocytopenia. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungal coverage with micafungin, and IV bactrim for culture-positive stenotrophomonas.

The patient has a code status of DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) and has been discussing goals of care with her sister and palliative care team.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and she may require increased ventilatory support or consideration for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock may worsen, leading to multi-organ dysfunction or failure.
3. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and sepsis may lead to secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI).
4. Hemorrhage: The patient's thrombocytopenia and anemia may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of invasive procedures or trauma.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's fluid and electrolyte disorder may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or other complications.
6. Cancer progression: The patient's NSCLC may progress, leading to further respiratory compromise, metastatic disease, or other complications.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, increasing the risk of bleeding or bleeding-related complications.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, or other complications.
9. Infection control: The patient's immunosuppressed state may increase the risk of infection, particularly from hospital-acquired pathogens.
10. End-of-life care: The patient's DNR status and discussion of goals of care may indicate that she is nearing the end of life, and palliative care and hospice services may be necessary to ensure her comfort and dignity."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 53 yo w/ recent dx of NSCLC who
   presented to OSH with pneumonia.  Y-stent removed and patient was
   transferred to ICU for further management.
   # Respiratory failure
 continues to have intermittent deteriorations
   while on vent with worsening CXR concerning for infection
   - continue mechanical ventilation and titrate FIO2, PEEP to goal pO2  >
   / = 60
   - f/u pan-cultures drawn [**8-4**] for temperature spike
   - f/u PM ABG s/p FIO2 down to 65%
   - will consider balloon placement to identify optimal PEEP pressures if
   continued de-sat on vent
   # PNA
 post-obstructive RUL with worsening airspace disease throughout
   lung fields bilateral likely representing spread of infection.  Patient
   noted to initially have oral thrush at time of intubation
   patient with post-obstructive RUL and now worsening airspace disease
   throughout left lung field likely representing spread of infection.
   Patient was also noted initially to have thrush in mouth at intubation
   in the setting of steroid therapy for her cancer diagnosis.
   - will continue broad spectrum antibiotics pending cultures (estimated
   2-3 days) and IV bactrim for culture + stenotrophomonas, will continue
   antifungal coverage with micafungin given appearance of thrush and
   immunosuppresion.
   - will consider adding Vancomycin given fever spikes s/p DC on [**8-3**] and
   bump in WBC counts
   .
   # Perianal Ulcers
   -  f/u wound Cx for HSV - pending
   # NSCLC
 patient was receiving decadron initially for airway
   inflammation now on vent
   - decadron to be tapered over 2 weeks, now 2 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
 may consider
   changing to 1.5 mg AM and 2 mg PM
   - XRT to be deferred for now as peritracheal mass in RUL may lead to
   more disseminate infection and worsening clinical picture, also patient
   may not be able to tolerate transport out of the MICU at this time
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia - most likely secondary to recent
   chemotherapy.
   - will continue serial HCT to monitor for hemorrhage - stable
   .
   # FEN: IVF bolus as above, TF, replete electrolytes, increase SS to
   maintain sugars < 200, may consider diuresis today considering 2 L
   positive since yesterday
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI, bowel reg.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

Ms. [**Known lastname 4443**], a 53-year-old female, is a patient in the ICU with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and post-obstructive pneumonia. She presented with worsening bilateral airspace disease and has been experiencing intermittent deteriorations while on mechanical ventilation. Her current condition is concerning for infection, and she has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal coverage.

The patient has a history of oral thrush, which may be related to her immunosuppressive therapy for cancer. She has also developed perianal ulcers, which are pending wound culture for herpes simplex virus (HSV). Her anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely secondary to recent chemotherapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening bilateral airspace disease and intermittent deteriorations while on mechanical ventilation may lead to further respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient's fever spikes and increased white blood cell count may indicate a bacterial or fungal infection, which could worsen her condition.
3. Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may increase her risk of bleeding and hemorrhage.
4. Perianal Ulcers: The patient's perianal ulcers may become infected, leading to further complications.
5. NSCLC Progression: The patient's NSCLC may progress, leading to further respiratory failure and decreased quality of life.
6. Pneumonia Complications: The patient's pneumonia may lead to further complications, such as pleural effusion or empyema.
7. Thromboembolic Events: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may increase her risk of thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's chemotherapy and immunosuppressive therapy may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and titrate FiO2 and PEEP to goal PO2 > 60.
2. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics pending cultures (estimated 2-3 days).
3. Continue antifungal coverage with micafungin given the patient's thrush and immunosuppression.
4. Consider adding Vancomycin given the patient's fever spikes and increased white blood cell count.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia, and consider transfusions as necessary.
6. Continue serial HCT to monitor for hemorrhage.
7. Consider diuresis today considering the patient's 2 L positive fluid balance since yesterday.
8. Monitor the patient's perianal ulcers and consider wound culture for HSV.
9. Consider changing the patient's steroid therapy to taper over 2 weeks.
10. Consider deferring XRT until the patient's peritracheal mass in the RUL resolves."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia and was subsequently intubated. She has been experiencing intermittent deteriorations while on mechanical ventilation, with worsening CXR concerning for infection. Her temperature spiked to 101.4°F, and her WBC count increased to 17 from 10.8. She has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including IV bactrim and micafungin, and has pending cultures for blood, urine, and HSV. Her anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely secondary to recent chemotherapy. She has been receiving IVF boluses, TF, and replete electrolytes, and her sugars have been controlled with Lantus. She has a DNR code status and is being managed with palliative care and social work.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status continues to deteriorate, with worsening CXR and intermittent desaturations. She may require further interventions, such as balloon placement to identify optimal PEEP pressures.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is likely due to spread of infection from her lung cancer, and she may require further antibiotics and antifungal therapy.
3. Perianal ulcers: The patient has perianal ulcers, which may be related to HSV infection. She has pending cultures for HSV, and further treatment may be necessary.
4. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely secondary to recent chemotherapy, and she may require further transfusions and supportive care.
5. Infection: The patient has a temperature spike and WBC elevation, which may indicate a new infection. She has pending cultures for blood, urine, and HSV, and further antibiotic therapy may be necessary.
6. VAP: The patient has a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which may require further antibiotics and antifungal therapy.
7. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient is receiving steroids for her lung cancer, and she may be at risk for adrenal insufficiency. She should be monitored closely for signs of adrenal insufficiency, such as hypotension and hyperpigmentation.
8. Malnutrition: The patient has a high risk of malnutrition due to her prolonged stay in the ICU and her underlying medical conditions. She should be monitored closely for signs of malnutrition, such as weight loss and decreased muscle mass.
9. Pressure ulcers: The patient has a high risk of developing pressure ulcers due to her prolonged stay in bed and her underlying medical conditions. She should be monitored closely for signs of pressure ulcers, such as redness, swelling, and breakdown of the skin."
141589.0,277451,2178-08-06 07:02:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"Chief Complaint: Ms. [**Known lastname 4443**] is a 53 year-old female with a recent
   diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer who admitted to OSH on [**7-27**] for
   dyspnea for 1-2 days PTA.  In addition, she reported increased
   respiratory secretions, fevers and chills.  At OSH, she was found to
   have PNA and there was concern about a possible stent obstruction so
   she was transferred to BICMC on [**7-29**] for urgent bronchscopy and stent
   evaluation.  On [**7-29**] she underwent rigid bronchoscopy and it was found
   that her y-stent migrated so it was removed.  She was noted to have
   thrush in her trachea.  She was intubated for the procedure and it was
   decided to keep the patient ventillated post-bronch given the severity
   of her PNA.
   24 Hour Events:
   -ID recs: start meropenem 500 q6 and d/c zosyn, continue cipro and
   bactrim, add back vancomycin for fever spikes + inc. WBC, consider
   replacing midline if fever spikes continue or BCx+

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Ms. [**Known lastname 4443**] is a 53 year-old female with a recent
   diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer who admitted to OSH on [**7-27**] for
   dyspnea for 1-2 days PTA.  In addition, she reported increased
   respiratory secretions, fevers and chills.  At OSH, she was found to
   have PNA and there was concern about a possible stent obstruction so
   she was transferred to BICMC on [**7-29**] for urgent bronchscopy and stent
   evaluation.  On [**7-29**] she underwent rigid bronchoscopy and it was found
   that her y-stent migrated so it was removed.  She was noted to have
   thrush in her trachea.  She was intubated for the procedure and it was
   decided to keep the patient ventillated post-bronch given the severity
   of her PNA.
   24 Hour Events:
   -ID recs: start meropenem 500 q6 and d/c zosyn, continue cipro and
   bactrim, add back vancomycin for fever spikes + inc. WBC, consider
   replacing midline if fever spikes continue or BCx+
   -Palliative recs: continued patient decline despite aggressive
   treatments, recommend transition to CMO if family agrees

Based on the progress note, the patient, a 53-year-old female with non-small cell lung cancer, is currently in the ICU due to pneumonia and respiratory failure. She was intubated for bronchoscopy and has been on mechanical ventilation since then. The patient has been experiencing intermittent deteriorations while on vent, with worsening CXR concerning for infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters are not meeting goal, and she continues to have intermittent deteriorations while on vent. This may lead to further respiratory compromise and potential need for more aggressive respiratory support.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a post-obstructive right upper lobe with worsening airspace disease throughout lung fields, likely representing spread of infection. This may lead to further pulmonary compromise and potential need for more aggressive antibiotic therapy.
3. Infection: The patient has a temperature spike and WBC elevation to 17 from 10, which may indicate a more severe infection. This may lead to further compromise of her respiratory and cardiovascular systems.
4. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely secondary to recent chemotherapy, and may lead to further bleeding and infection complications.
5. Perianal ulcers: The patient has perianal ulcers that are pending culture for HSV, which may lead to further complications if left untreated.
6. NSCLC: The patient's NSCLC is likely to progress and may lead to further respiratory and cardiovascular complications.
7. VAP: The patient has a high risk of VAP due to her respiratory failure and prolonged intubation.
8. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient is receiving steroids for airway inflammation, and may be at risk for adrenal insufficiency if the steroids are tapered too quickly.

The patient's current plan includes:

* Continuing mechanical ventilation and titrating FIO2 and PEEP to goal PO2 > 60
* Following pan-cultures drawn on [**8-4**] for temperature spike
* Following PM ABG s/p FIO2 down to 65%
* Considering balloon placement to identify optimal PEEP pressures if continued desat on vent
* Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics with IV bactrim for Cx + stenotrophomonas and micafungin for fungal coverage
* Following ID recs and pan-cultures s/p temperature spike
* Considering adding Vancomycin given time course of fever spike s/p DC vanc on [**8-3**]
* Holding off on full decadron taper considering picture of worsening infection
* Deferring XRT for now due to peri-tracheal mass in RUL and potential for disseminated infection
* Serial HCT to monitor for hemorrhage
* IVF bolus, TF, replete electrolytes, and increased standing Lantus to maintain sugars < 200
* Considering diuresis today given 2 L positive since yesterday
* Subcutaneous heparin, PPI, and bowel reg. for prophylaxis
* Midline, 2 peripherals, and A-line for access

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Ms. [**Known lastname 4443**] is a 53 year-old female with a recent
   diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer who admitted to OSH on [**7-27**] for
   dyspnea for 1-2 days PTA.  In addition, she reported increased
   respiratory secretions, fevers and chills.  At OSH, she was found to
   have PNA and there was concern about a possible stent obstruction so
   she was transferred to BICMC on [**7-29**] for urgent bronchscopy and stent
   evaluation.  On [**7-29**] she underwent rigid bronchoscopy and it was found
   that her y-stent migrated so it was removed.  She was noted to have
   thrush in her trachea.  She was intubated for the procedure and it was
   decided to keep the patient ventillated post-bronch given the severity
   of her PNA.
   24 Hour Events:
   -ID recs: start meropenem 500 q6 and d/c zosyn, continue cipro and
   bactrim, add back vancomycin for fever spikes + inc. WBC, consider
   replacing midline if fever spikes continue or BCx+
   -Palliative recs: continued patient decline despite aggressive
   treatments, recommend transition to CMO if family agrees

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer, is admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and pneumonia. She underwent rigid bronchoscopy and had a y-stent removed due to migration. She was intubated for the procedure and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 72 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 91/50 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 96%. Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 6.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 331. Her blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures are pending.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Respiratory failure: Continue mechanical ventilation and titrate FIO2 and PEEP to goal pO2 > 60. Consider balloon placement to identify optimal PEEP pressures if continued desaturation on vent.
2. Pneumonia: Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics with IV bactrim for Cx+ Stenotrophomonas and micafungin for fungal coverage in the setting of immunosuppression and visualized thrush at time of intubation.
3. Perianal ulcers: F/u wound Cx for HSV - pending.
4. NSCLC: Hold off on full decadron taper considering the picture of worsening infection. Do not want to jeopardize steroid levels and adrenal function in the current clinical setting.
5. Anemia/thrombocytopenia: Most likely secondary to recent chemotherapy. Serial HCT to monitor for hemorrhage - stable.
6. FEN: IVF bolus as above, TF, replete electrolytes, increased standing Lantus to maintain sugars < 200, may consider diuresis today.
7. Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI, bowel reg.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: Continued deterioration of lung function, leading to increased respiratory distress and potential need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Pneumonia: Spread of infection to other parts of the body, including the bloodstream, leading to sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Perianal ulcers: Worsening of skin breakdown, leading to increased risk of infection and potential need for surgical intervention.
4. NSCLC: Progression of disease, leading to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential need for palliative care.
5. Anemia/thrombocytopenia: Hemorrhage or bleeding complications, potentially life-threatening.
6. FEN: Electrolyte imbalance, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and potentially life-threatening complications.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to continue monitoring her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Ms. [**Known lastname 4443**] is a 53 year-old female with a recent
   diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer who admitted to OSH on [**7-27**] for
   dyspnea for 1-2 days PTA.  In addition, she reported increased
   respiratory secretions, fevers and chills.  At OSH, she was found to
   have PNA and there was concern about a possible stent obstruction so
   she was transferred to BICMC on [**7-29**] for urgent bronchscopy and stent
   evaluation.  On [**7-29**] she underwent rigid bronchoscopy and it was found
   that her y-stent migrated so it was removed.  She was noted to have
   thrush in her trachea.  She was intubated for the procedure and it was
   decided to keep the patient ventillated post-bronch given the severity
   of her PNA.
   24 Hour Events:
   -ID recs: start meropenem 500 q6 and d/c zosyn, continue cipro and
   bactrim, add back vancomycin for fever spikes + inc. WBC, consider
   replacing midline if fever spikes continue or BCx+
   -Palliative recs: continued patient decline despite aggressive
   treatments, recommend transition to CMO if family agrees

The patient was intubated for bronchoscopy and has been ventilated post-procedure. The patient's clinical status continues to deteriorate, with CXR consistent with spreading infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status continues to worsen, and there is a risk of further deterioration, which may lead to respiratory arrest.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a severe case of pneumonia, and there is a risk of spreading infection to other parts of the body.
3. Sepsis: The patient's temperature spike and white blood cell count increase suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may worsen due to ongoing chemotherapy and may increase the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage.
5. Wound infection: The patient has perianal ulcers with a suspected HSV infection, which may lead to further complications if not properly managed.
6. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient is receiving steroids for airway inflammation, and there is a risk of adrenal insufficiency if the steroids are tapered too quickly.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications if not properly managed.
8. Infection control: The patient is at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) due to the presence of central lines and endotracheal tubes.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should receive aggressive treatment for pneumonia, including broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal therapy. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and the ventilator settings should be adjusted accordingly. The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia should be managed with transfusions and medications as needed. The perianal ulcers should be managed with wound care and antibiotics as needed. The patient's adrenal function should be closely monitored, and the steroids should be tapered gradually to avoid adrenal insufficiency. Finally, the patient's electrolyte levels should be closely monitored, and the patient should receive electrolyte replacement therapy as needed."
141589.0,277451,2178-08-06 07:02:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"Chief Complaint: Ms. [**Known lastname 4443**] is a 53 year-old female with a recent
   diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer who admitted to OSH on [**7-27**] for
   dyspnea for 1-2 days PTA.  In addition, she reported increased
   respiratory secretions, fevers and chills.  At OSH, she was found to
   have PNA and there was concern about a possible stent obstruction so
   she was transferred to BICMC on [**7-29**] for urgent bronchscopy and stent
   evaluation.  On [**7-29**] she underwent rigid bronchoscopy and it was found
   that her y-stent migrated so it was removed.  She was noted to have
   thrush in her trachea.  She was intubated for the procedure and it was
   decided to keep the patient ventillated post-bronch given the severity
   of her PNA.
   24 Hour Events:
   -ID recs: start meropenem 500 q6 and d/c zosyn, continue cipro and
   bactrim, add back vancomycin for fever spikes + inc. WBC, consider
   replacing midline if fever spikes continue or BCx+

   - continue broad spec antibiotics with IV bactrim for Cx +
   stenotrophomonas with micafungin for fungal coverage in setting of
   immunosuppression and visualized thrush at time of intubation
   - will add meropenum with vancomycin for temperature spike and
   discontinue Zosyn per ID recommendations.  If continued temperature
   spikes will consider replacing midline and arterial line.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer who presented to the hospital with pneumonia and was intubated for respiratory failure. The patient's clinical status continues to worsen, with CXR consistent with spreading infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status continues to deteriorate, and the risk of further respiratory failure is high. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory rate is essential.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a high risk of developing pneumonia due to her immunosuppressed state and the presence of oral thrush. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and pan-cultures should be drawn to guide further antibiotic therapy.
3. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely secondary to recent chemotherapy. Serial HCT monitoring is essential to prevent hemorrhage.
4. Perianal ulcers: The patient has perianal ulcers with a suspected HSV infection. Fungal coverage with micafungin should be continued, and wound cultures should be drawn to guide further treatment.
5. Decadron taper: The patient is receiving decadron for airway inflammation, but the decision to taper should be delayed due to the worsening infection.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels should be closely monitored and repleted as necessary to prevent complications.
7. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis: The patient is at high risk of developing VTE due to her immobility and underlying medical conditions. Prophylactic heparin should be continued.
8. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient is at high risk of developing stress ulcers due to her critical illness. Prophylactic PPI should be continued.
9. Glycemic control: The patient's glucose levels should be closely monitored and controlled to prevent hyperglycemia and its complications.
10. Code status: The patient's code status is DNR, and ongoing discussions with the family are essential to clarify goals of care and consider CMO with potential trial of terminal extubation.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are essential to prevent further complications and improve her outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. She was intubated and transferred to the ICU for further management.

The patient's clinical status has continued to worsen, and she is currently experiencing respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, and impaired skin integrity. She has also developed perianal ulcers and is at risk for septic shock.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including Caspofungin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Vancomycin, and Micafungin, as well as antifungal coverage with Micafungin. She has also been receiving IV fluids and electrolyte repletion.

The patient's laboratory results show the following:

* WBC count: 12.9
* Hct: 20.0
* Plt: 368
* Cr: 0.4
* TCO2: 41
* Glucose: 130
* Albumin: 1.9 g/dL
* LDH: 445 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.7 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL
* PO4: 2.1 mg/dL

The patient's microbiology results show the presence of Gram-negative rods, including Enterobacter aerogenes, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Yeast.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hyperglycemia: Continue IV fluids and electrolyte repletion.
* Ineffective coping: Continue to monitor and manage the patient's respiratory status.
* Shock, septic: Continue to monitor and manage the patient's hemodynamic status.
* Impaired skin integrity: Continue to monitor and manage the patient's skin integrity.
* Hypotension (not shock): Continue to monitor and manage the patient's blood pressure.
* Electrolyte and fluid disorder, other: Continue to monitor and manage the patient's electrolyte and fluid status.
* Respiratory failure, acute: Continue to monitor and manage the patient's respiratory status.
* Cancer (malignant neoplasm), lung: Continue to manage the patient's underlying cancer diagnosis.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and she is currently in the process of defining her CMO (comfort measures only) with potential trial of terminal extubation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with pneumonia. She was intubated and transferred to the ICU for further management.

The patient's current clinical status continues to worsen, and she is unlikely to improve without further intervention. The goals of care are being redefined, and the possibility of comfort measures only (CMO) and terminal extubation is being considered.

The patient has several medical conditions, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and her clinical status continues to worsen.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has post-obstructive RUL with worsening air space disease throughout the lung fields, likely representing the spread of infection.
3. Perianal ulcers: The patient has a wound culture positive for HSV, and antibiotics are being held due to the current goals of care.
4. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely secondary to recent chemotherapy.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which is being managed with insulin.
6. Shock, septic: The patient has septic shock, which is being managed with fluids and antibiotics.
7. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which is being managed with wound care.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to further decline in her clinical status.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia can spread to other parts of the lung, leading to further decline in her clinical status.
3. Perianal ulcers: The patient's perianal ulcers can become infected, leading to further complications.
4. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia can worsen, leading to further complications.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia can worsen, leading to further complications.
6. Shock, septic: The patient's septic shock can worsen, leading to further complications.
7. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity can worsen, leading to further complications.

In terms of the patient's laboratory results, the following abnormalities were noted:

1. WBC: The patient's WBC count is elevated at 17.2 K/uL.
2. Hct: The patient's Hct is elevated at 24.2%.
3. Plt: The patient's Plt count is elevated at 331 K/uL.
4. Cr: The patient's Cr is elevated at 0.4 mg/dL.
5. TCO2: The patient's TCO2 is elevated at 44 mmol/L.
6. Glucose: The patient's glucose level is elevated at 203 mg/dL.
7. Lactic acid: The patient's lactic acid level is elevated at 2.3 mmol/L.
8. Albumin: The patient's albumin level is low at 1.9 g/dL.
9. LDH: The patient's LDH level is elevated at 445 IU/L.
10. Ca++: The patient's Ca++ level is elevated at 7.7 mg/dL.
11. Mg++: The patient's Mg++ level is low at 2.0 mg/dL.
12. PO4: The patient's PO4 level is low at 2.1 mg/dL.

The patient's microbiology results show the presence of Enterobacter aerogenes, Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia, yeast, and Enterobacter cloacae in her blood cultures. The patient's antibiotic therapy is being modified based on these results.

In terms of the patient's medications, the following are being used:

1. Caspofungin: The patient is receiving caspofungin for fungal infection.
2. Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn): The patient is receiving piperacillin/tazobactam for bacterial infection.

12. Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis): The patient is receiving heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis.
13. Other medications: The patient is receiving other medications, including insulin, antibiotics, and antifungals.

In terms of the patient's vital signs, the following are notable:

1. Temperature: The patient's temperature is normal at 36.7°C (98.1°F).
2. Heart rate: The patient's heart rate is normal at 62 beats per minute.
3. Blood pressure: The patient's blood pressure is normal at 94/53 mmHg.
4. Respiratory rate: The patient's respiratory rate is normal at 28 breaths per minute.
5. SpO2: The patient's SpO2 is normal at 99%.
6. Pulse oximeter: The patient's pulse oximeter is normal at 99%.
7. Blood glucose: The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 203 mg/dL.

In terms of the patient's physical examination, the following are notable:
