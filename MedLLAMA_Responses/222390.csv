You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old woman with a history of dyslipidemia, who presented with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was treated with a bare metal stent. She was loaded with integrilin and heparin, and started on low-dose captopril for cardioprotection. The patient has remained hypotensive while asleep, normotensive when awake, and the evening dose of captopril was held due to low nighttime blood pressures.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) shows persistent ST elevations, which is a poor prognostic sign. The patient also has a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and chronic lung disease.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 99% on nasal cannula oxygen. Her cardiac status is stable, with a normal sinus rhythm and no signs of cardiac failure. However, she has a history of cardiac disease and is at risk for cardiac complications.

The patient's gastrointestinal status is stable, with no signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or obstruction. Her renal function is stable, with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL.

The patient's neurological status is stable, with no signs of neurological deficits or worsening of her underlying neurological condition.

The patient's skin status is stable, with no signs of skin breakdown or infection.

The patient's overall condition is stable, but she is at risk for cardiac complications, including ventricular thrombus formation, LV aneurysmal formation, and other mechanical complications. She also has a history of anaphylaxis and is at risk for recurrent anaphylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: Ventricular thrombus formation, LV aneurysmal formation, and other mechanical complications.
2. Respiratory complications: Pneumonia, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Gastrointestinal complications: Gastrointestinal bleeding, obstruction, and perforation.
4. Renal complications: Acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease.
5. Neurological complications: Stroke, seizures, and worsening of underlying neurological condition.
6. Skin complications: Skin breakdown, infection, and pressure ulcers.
7. Anaphylaxis: Recurrent anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening.
8. Hypothyroidism: Worsening of hypothyroidism, which can lead to decreased thyroid function and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
9. Hypoestrogenism: Worsening of hypoestrogenism, which can lead to decreased estrogen levels and increased risk of osteoporosis.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is recommended that she receive close monitoring and treatment in the ICU, with a focus on preventing and managing potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 86-year-old woman who presented with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was successfully revascularized with a bare metal stent. She has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for close monitoring and management. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, particularly at night, and has had an episode of choking sensation, which was attributed to an allergic response. She has also had persistent ST elevations on her electrocardiogram (ECG) despite successful revascularization.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension, particularly at night, may be a sign of cardiac tamponade or other cardiac complications.
2. Allergic Response: The patient's episode of choking sensation may be a sign of an allergic response to the contrast agent used during the PCI procedure.
3. Persistent ST Elevations: The patient's persistent ST elevations on her ECG may indicate ongoing cardiac injury or microvascular reperfusion injury, which may increase the risk of LV aneurysmal formation and other mechanical complications.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient's imaging studies suggest fluid overload, which may be contributing to her hypotension and other cardiac complications.
5. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient's hypotension and persistent ST elevations may also be indicative of cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and treatment.
6. Ventricular Thrombus: The patient's persistent ST elevations may also be indicative of ventricular thrombus, which is a complication of STEMI that requires anticoagulation therapy.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism may be contributing to her cardiac symptoms and may require further evaluation and treatment.
8. Hypoestrogenism: The patient's history of long-term estrogen therapy may be contributing to her cardiac symptoms and may require further evaluation and treatment.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and cardiac rhythm closely to detect any changes or complications.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's ECG for any changes or signs of cardiac injury.
3. Consider further evaluation and treatment of the patient's persistent ST elevations, including echocardiography and stress testing.
4. Consider anticoagulation therapy to prevent ventricular thrombus formation.
5. Consider further evaluation and treatment of the patient's hypothyroidism and hypoestrogenism.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's fluid status and adjust her fluid management accordingly.
7. Consider further evaluation and treatment of the patient's cardiac tamponade, if present."

   is not an uncommon phenomenon, present in 20-50% of pts in numerous
   trials assessing this marker of poor prognosis.   Perisistent ST
   elevations despite TIMI III flow are possibly due to microvascular
   reperfuion injury.  increasing risk of LV aneurysmal formation,

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   86 year old female who presented with nausea and chest pressure X 1
   day.  Nausea and substernal chest pressure began at 7pm 1 day PTA after
   dinner. Pressure was described as located in the mid chest without
   radiation. She stated that she has been experiencing dyspnea over the
   past two months and was undergoing a pulmonary workup with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   recalls feeling severe nausea.  She went to bed essentially chest pain
   free per her report.  She awoke at 3am on DOA with persistence of her
   symptoms.  At 6am, the pain was worse.  She describes it as sharp,
   substernal [**7-1**], worse with inspiration.  It was associated with
   nausea.  She denied associated SOB or diphoresis, radiation.  She also
   denied recent illness, jaw pain, cough, diarrhea, hematochezia, or
   hematemesis. She called EMS and was brought to the ED then to the
   floor. On the floor the patient experienced worse chest pain associated
   with ST elevations in V3-V6 so she was brought to the cath lab. Cath
   demonstrated an occluded LAD at the mid level with moderate disease
   elsewhere. A 2.5mm X 12mm MiniVision (BMS) stent was placed in the mid
   LAD and post-dilated with a 2.5mm NC balloon with TIMI 3 flow following
   the procedure. Echo demonstrated severe HK to akinesis in the anterior
   wall with EF 30-35%. CK perk was 976 with MB 9.5 and trop 6.13.
   Integrilin is now off. BPs have been 80/60 and so ACEI has been held.
   Otherwise no further chest pain this am but she does report
   intermittent throat tightness similar to her allergic symptoms but the
   symptoms are not present now.
   Physical Examination
   lungs - scant bibas rales
   Heart - soft HSM
   ext no edema.
   Medical Decision Making
   86 female her with anterion STEMI s/p successful revasc with BMS. We
   will push beta blockers as BP allows. Will add warfarin to prevent
   mural thrombus. Plavix and asa mandatory for one month and out to one
   year if possible. Lipito 80 mg QD per PROVE IT TIMI 22. Hopefully the
   wall motion is myocardial stunning as CK/MB rise was moderate for the
   degree of wall motion abnormality. Will resume ACEI when BP allow. Team
   had been told to watch for increase MR murmur and free wall rupture.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed with primary
   care physician: [**Name10 (NameIs) 568**] and Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes of critical care time.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   86 year old female who presented with nausea and chest pressure X 1
   day.  Nausea and substernal chest pressure began at 7pm 1 day PTA after
   dinner. Pressure was described as located in the mid chest without
   radiation. She stated that she has been experiencing dyspnea over the
   past two months and was undergoing a pulmonary workup with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   recalls feeling severe nausea.  She went to bed essentially chest pain
   free per her report.  She awoke at 3am on DOA with persistence of her
   symptoms.  At 6am, the pain was worse.  She describes it as sharp,
   substernal [**7-1**], worse with inspiration.  It was associated with
   nausea.  She denied associated SOB or diphoresis, radiation.  She also
   denied recent illness, jaw pain, cough, diarrhea, hematochezia, or
   hematemesis. She called EMS and was brought to the ED then to the
   floor. On the floor the patient experienced worse chest pain associated
   with ST elevations in V3-V6 so she was brought to the cath lab. Cath
   demonstrated an occluded LAD at the mid level with moderate disease
   elsewhere. A 2.5mm X 12mm MiniVision (BMS) stent was placed in the mid
   LAD and post-dilated with a 2.5mm NC balloon with TIMI 3 flow following
   the procedure. Echo demonstrated severe HK to akinesis in the anterior
   wall with EF 30-35%. CK perk was 976 with MB 9.5 and trop 6.13.
   Integrilin is now off. BPs have been 80/60 and so ACEI has been held.
   Otherwise no further chest pain this am but she does report
   intermittent throat tightness similar to her allergic symptoms but the
   symptoms are not present now.
   Physical Examination
   lungs - scant bibas rales
   Heart - soft HSM
   ext no edema.
   Medical Decision Making
   86 female her with anterion STEMI s/p successful revasc with BMS. We
   will push beta blockers as BP allows. Will add warfarin to prevent
   mural thrombus. Plavix and asa mandatory for one month and out to one
   year if possible. Lipito 80 mg QD per PROVE IT TIMI 22. Hopefully the
   wall motion is myocardial stunning as CK/MB rise was moderate for the
   degree of wall motion abnormality. Will resume ACEI when BP allow. Team
   had been told to watch for increase MR murmur and free wall rupture.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed with primary
   care physician: [**Name10 (NameIs) 568**] and Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes of critical care time.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

**Patient Information**

* Age: 86 years old
* Sex: Female
* Medical History:
	+ Dyslipidemia
	+ Hypothyroidism
	+ Hypoestrogenism
	+ MGUS
	+ L2-L3 laminectomy
* Current Condition: Anterior STEMI with severe hypokinesis to akinesis in the anterior wall, EF 30-35%

**24-Hour Events**

* The patient was brought to the stent lab and underwent revascularization with a bare metal stent in the mid LAD.
* She experienced hypotension overnight, with a blood pressure of 30s/70s mmHg, which improved when she was awakened.
* She had an episode of choking sensation overnight, which was likely an allergic response, but did not experience shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, or ECG changes.

**Vital Signs**

* Temperature: 37.2°C (98.9°F)
* Heart Rate: 55-95 bpm
* Blood Pressure: 85/59 mmHg (normotensive when awake, hypotensive when asleep)
* Respiratory Rate: 15-22 breaths per minute
* Oxygen Saturation: 99%
* Heart Rhythm: Sinus Rhythm

**Physical Examination**

* General: Well-developed, well-nourished female in no acute distress
* Cardiovascular: Soft heart sounds, normal S1, S2, soft holosystolic murmur at apex
* Lungs: Scant bibasilar rales
* Abdomen: Soft, non-tender
* Extremities: No edema

**Lab Results**

* White Blood Cell Count: 9.1 K/μL
* Hematocrit: 36.2%
* Platelet Count: 171 K/μL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 6.13 ng/mL
* Blood Urea Nitrogen: 24 mg/dL
* Glucose: 132 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, Ca++/Mg++/PO4

**Imaging**

* Chest X-ray: Increased bilateral peripheral and perihilar interstitial opacities, small bilateral pleural effusions, linear opacity at the left lung base, and hyperexpansion compatible with underlying chronic lung disease.

**Medical Complications**

* Risk of LV aneurysmal formation and mechanical complications due to persistent ST elevations despite TIMI III flow
* Risk of early infarct due to IV steroids administered within 24 hours of STEMI
* Risk of anaphylaxis with IV contrast
* Risk of hypoestrogenism due to long-term estrogen therapy
* Risk of hypothyroidism

**Assessment and Plan**

* The patient is at high risk for LV aneurysmal formation and mechanical complications due to persistent ST elevations despite TIMI III flow.
* She will require close monitoring and potential treatment with warfarin to prevent mural thrombus.
* Beta blockers will be pushed as BP allows to control heart rate and blood pressure.
* Plavix and ASA will be continued for one month and out to one year if possible.
* Lipitor 80 mg QD will be started to reduce LDL cholesterol.
* ACEI will be resumed when BP allows.
* The patient will be monitored for increase MR murmur and free wall rupture."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female who presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent bare metal stent placement. She was loaded with integrillin and heparin and started on low-dose captopril for cardioprotection. She has remained hypotensive while asleep and normotensive when awake. Her blood pressure is being managed with dopamine, and her heart rate is in the 80s-90s. She has persistent STE on ECG, which is not uncommon after revascularization.

The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 32.5 g/dL, which is likely due to acute blood loss anemia. She has a risk of anaphylaxis with IV contrast and was pretreated with solumedrol and benadryl. She is also at risk for hypoestrogenism due to long-term estrogen therapy, which is being discontinued. She has hypothyroidism and is being continued on home synthroid.

The patient's medical history includes dyslipidemia, MGUS, and L2-L3 laminectomy. She is being treated with atorvastatin, ASA, Plavix, and metoprolol. She is being monitored for cardiac, renal, and respiratory function, and her blood pressure is being managed with dopamine.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's persistent STE on ECG and poor contractility may increase her risk of LV aneurysmal formation and other mechanical complications.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if she experiences further blood loss or if her hemoglobin level drops below 30 g/dL.
3. Contrast allergy: The patient has a risk of anaphylaxis with IV contrast and may experience severe symptoms such as throat closure, hypotension, and respiratory distress.
4. Hypoestrogenism: The patient's discontinuation of estrogen therapy may lead to symptoms such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and mood changes.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if her thyroid hormone levels become too low, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, cold intolerance, and weight gain.
6. MGUS: The patient's MGUS may worsen if her plasma cell count increases, leading to symptoms such as bone pain, anemia, and kidney damage.
7. L2-L3 laminectomy: The patient's laminectomy may lead to complications such as nerve damage, spinal instability, and chronic pain.
8. Renal complications: The patient's renal function may worsen if she experiences further blood loss or if her blood pressure is not adequately controlled.
9. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory function may worsen if she experiences further blood loss or if her oxygen saturation levels drop.
10. Infection: The patient may be at risk for infection due to her compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yof w/ h/o dyslipidemia p/w SSCP and nausea, STE on ECG, and
   complete occlusion of mid LAD, s/p bare metal stent placement.
   # CORONARIES - Pt s/p  bare metal stent.   She was loaded with
   integrellin and heparin.  She was also started on low dose captopril
   for cardioprotection.  BB was deferred given risk of vasovagal response
   and bradycardia with sheath removal.  She has remained hypotensive
   while asleep, normotensive when awake.  Given low nighttime blood
   pressures evening dose of captopril was held.  Continues to have HR in
   80s-90s.  BB for HR control may have better outcomes.  Does not require
   afterload reduction at present
   - atorvastatin 80
   - ASA 325
   - Plavix 75
   - will hold BB until BP improves.
   - will consider ACE when BP improves
   # PUMP:  Pt now s/p STEMI with worsening STE on ECG s/p intervention.
   Perisistent STE after revascularization is not an uncommon phenomenon,
   present in 20-50% of pts in numerous trials assessing this marker of
   poor prognosis,  increasing risk of LV aneurysmal formation, possibly
   other mechanical complications.  She also recieved IV steroids w/in 24
   hrs of STEMI, some data suggests this may possibly increase risk of
   mechanical complication.   Post infarct ECHO shows 35% and pt has
   persistent hypotension, responding minimally to fluids.  Poor
   contractility is likely the cause of hypotension.  Doing well on
   Dopamine.
   - continue Dopa, wean as tolerated
   - follow UOP and O2 sats
   - contin heparin for ventricular thrombus
   - initiated coumadin 5mg  [**11-30**], can f/u in 3 months for repeat ECHO,
   and possible d/c at that time.
   # RHYTHM: Pt has maintained nl sinus rhythm throughout, intermittent
   PVCs
   #Anemia
 Hct 32.  Baseline 40.  Negative 1L post cath (after being
   given IVF for renal protection prior to cath).
   -          Acute blood loss anemia, though significant blood loss not
   reported with procedure
   -          dilutional, pt received IVF prior to admission to the CCU
   -          will trend, Transfuse if Hct <27 or sx.
   -
   # Contrast allergy - Pt has risk of anaphylaxis with IV contrast she
   was given for PCI.  She was pretreated with solumedrol and benadryl.
   Will have to follow for signs of anaphylaxis, including throat closing,
   hypotension.  No severe sx.  Hypotension can be attributed to this
   also, but she has been premedicated, and has no respiratory sx.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) and was found to have complete occlusion of the mid Left Anterior Descending (LAD) artery. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and received a bare metal stent.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 38.1°C (100.6°F), Heart Rate 79-90 bpm, Blood Pressure 84/48 mmHg, Respiratory Rate 6 inspirations per minute, Oxygen Saturation 90%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving dopamine to maintain a systolic blood pressure of 90-100 mmHg.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 2,843 mL of fluids, with a net balance of 293 mL.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 9.1-10.1 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin is 11.1-12.1 g/dL, and platelet count is 192-230 x 10^9/L. Her troponin level is 2.70-6.13 ng/mL, and her creatinine level is 0.8-0.9 mg/dL.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Coronary artery disease
* Hypertension
* Dyslipidemia
* Anemia (due to acute blood loss and dilutional anemia)
* Contrast allergy
* Hypoestrogenism (due to long-term estrogen therapy)
* Hypothyroidism
* MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance)
* L2-L3 laminectomy with inability to remove leads

The patient's medications include:

* Atorvastatin 80 mg
* Aspirin 325 mg
* Plavix 75 mg
* Captopril (held due to hypotension)
* Dopamine (infusion)
* Heparin (infusion)
* Coumadin 5 mg (started on 11/30)
* Tylenol (for pain management)
* Colace and senna (for bowel regimen)
* Synthroid (for hypothyroidism)

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's persistent ST elevation on ECG and poor contractility may increase the risk of cardiac complications such as ventricular aneurysmal formation and mechanical complications.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory rate is 6 inspirations per minute, which may indicate respiratory compromise.
* Renal complications: The patient's creatinine level is 0.8-0.9 mg/dL, which may indicate acute kidney injury.
* Bleeding complications: The patient's platelet count is 192-230 x 10^9/L, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
* Anaphylaxis: The patient has a risk of anaphylaxis due to her contrast allergy.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may exacerbate her symptoms and increase the risk of complications.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is recommended that she continue to receive dopamine infusion to maintain her blood pressure, and that her medications be adjusted as necessary to manage her symptoms. It is also recommended that she receive close monitoring for cardiac, respiratory, and renal complications, as well as for bleeding and anaphylaxis."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   86 year old female who presented with nausea and chest pressure X 1
   day.  Nausea and substernal chest pressure began at 7pm 1 day PTA after
   dinner. Pressure was described as located in the mid chest without
   radiation. She stated that she has been experiencing dyspnea over the
   past two months and was undergoing a pulmonary workup with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   recalls feeling severe nausea.  She went to bed essentially chest pain
   free per her report.  She awoke at 3am on DOA with persistence of her
   symptoms.  At 6am, the pain was worse.  She describes it as sharp,
   substernal [**7-1**], worse with inspiration.  It was associated with
   nausea.  She denied associated SOB or diphoresis, radiation.  She also
   denied recent illness, jaw pain, cough, diarrhea, hematochezia, or
   hematemesis. She called EMS and was brought to the ED then to the
   floor. On the floor the patient experienced worse chest pain associated
   with ST elevations in V3-V6 so she was brought to the cath lab. Cath
   demonstrated an occluded LAD at the mid level with moderate disease
   elsewhere. A 2.5mm X 12mm MiniVision (BMS) stent was placed in the mid
   LAD and post-dilated with a 2.5mm NC balloon with TIMI 3 flow following
   the procedure. Echo demonstrated severe HK to akinesis in the anterior
   wall with EF 30-35%. CK perk was 976 with MB 9.5 and trop 6.13.
   Integrilin is now off. BPs have been 80/60 and so ACEI has been held.
   Otherwise no further chest pain this am but she does report
   intermittent throat tightness similar to her allergic symptoms but the
   symptoms are not present now.
   Physical Examination
   lungs - bibas rales
   heart - soft HSM
   ext - no edema
   Medical Decision Making
   Mrs [**Known lastname 3335**] is doing better today with ongoing hypotension overnight
   requiring moderate doses of dopamine to keep BPs in the 90-100 range.
   She reports no further chest pain. DA is at 3.5 mcg/min. She has a low
   grade temp with a rising wbc count to 10.1. Renal function is stable.
   Her hypotension is likely from stunning as she is only on low dose
   metoprolol. CK peaked in the 970 range. We will continue plavix and asa
   for one year as well as coumadin for prophylaxis against mural
   thrombus. We will give her H2B for GI coverage while she is taking
   three anticoagulants. To floor once DA weaned off.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 568**] and Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yof w/ h/o dyslipidemia p/w SSCP and nausea, STE on ECG, and
   complete occlusion of mid LAD, s/p bare metal stent placement.
   # CORONARIES - Pt s/p  bare metal stent.   She was loaded with
   integrellin and heparin.  She was also started on low dose captopril
   for cardioprotection.  BB was deferred given risk of vasovagal response
   and bradycardia with sheath removal.  She has remained hypotensive
   while asleep, normotensive when awake.  Given low nighttime blood
   pressures evening dose of captopril was held.  Continues to have HR in
   80s-90s.  BB for HR control may have better outcomes.  Does not require
   afterload reduction at present
   - atorvastatin 80
   - ASA 325
   - Plavix 75
   - will hold BB until BP improves.
   - will consider ACE when BP improves
   # PUMP:  Pt now s/p STEMI with worsening STE on ECG s/p intervention.
   Perisistent STE after revascularization is not an uncommon phenomenon,
   present in 20-50% of pts in numerous trials assessing this marker of
   poor prognosis,  increasing risk of LV aneurysmal formation, possibly
   other mechanical complications.  She also recieved IV steroids w/in 24
   hrs of STEMI, some data suggests this may possibly increase risk of
   mechanical complication.   Post infarct ECHO shows 35% and pt has
   persistent hypotension, responding minimally to fluids.  Poor
   contractility is likely the cause of hypotension.  Doing well on
   Dopamine.
   - continue Dopa, wean as tolerated
   - follow UOP and O2 sats
   - contin heparin for ventricular thrombus
   - initiated coumadin 5mg  [**11-30**], can f/u in 3 months for repeat ECHO,
   and possible d/c at that time.
   # RHYTHM: Pt has maintained nl sinus rhythm throughout, intermittent
   PVCs
   #Anemia
 Hct 32.  Baseline 40.  Negative 1L post cath (after being
   given IVF for renal protection prior to cath).
   -          Acute blood loss anemia, though significant blood loss not
   reported with procedure
   -          dilutional, pt received IVF prior to admission to the CCU
   -          will trend, Transfuse if Hct <27 or sx.
   -
   # Contrast allergy - Pt has risk of anaphylaxis with IV contrast she
   was given for PCI.  She was pretreated with solumedrol and benadryl.
   Will have to follow for signs of anaphylaxis, including throat closing,
   hypotension.  No severe sx.  Hypotension can be attributed to this
   also, but she has been premedicated, and has no respiratory sx.
   - Loratadine prn
   # ?Hypoestrogenism - Pt on long term estrogen therapy since the late
   [**2037**].  Not needed.
   - d/c estrogen
   # Hypothyroidism - continue home synthroid
   #MGUS - stable, followed as outpt
   #L2 - L3 Laminectomy s/p growth stim, leads unable to be removed, pt
   unable to get MRI.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female who presented with nausea and chest pressure one day prior to admission. She was diagnosed with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) artery. She has been experiencing hypotension, requiring dopamine to maintain a blood pressure of 90-100 mmHg, and has a low-grade fever with a rising white blood cell count.

Physical examination reveals bibasilar rales in the lungs, a soft holosystolic murmur in the heart, and no edema in the extremities. The patient has been on low-dose metoprolol and has a history of dyslipidemia, hypertension, and hypothyroidism.

Lab results show a hemoglobin level of 11.1 g/dL, a white blood cell count of 9.1 x 10^9/L, and a platelet count of 192 x 10^9/L. Troponin levels are elevated at 6.13 ng/mL.

The patient has been started on heparin, aspirin, and clopidogrel for anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. She has also been given an H2 blocker for gastrointestinal coverage while taking three anticoagulants.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of STEMI and has undergone PCI with stenting. She is at risk for cardiac complications such as ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, and cardiogenic shock.
2. Infection: The patient has a low-grade fever and a rising white blood cell count, which may indicate an underlying infection. She is at risk for developing sepsis and organ failure.
3. Bleeding: The patient is on anticoagulant therapy with heparin and warfarin, which may increase her risk of bleeding complications.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is taking three anticoagulants and an H2 blocker, which may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and other complications.
5. Thrombotic complications: The patient has a history of STEMI and has undergone PCI with stenting. She is at risk for developing thrombotic complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust her anticoagulant therapy as necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's white blood cell count and adjust her antibiotic therapy as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust her anticoagulant therapy as necessary.
4. Consider adding a platelet inhibitor to the patient's regimen to reduce her risk of bleeding complications.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her diuretic therapy as necessary to prevent fluid overload."
