   # Septic Shock: Source most likely GI vs. lung vs. urine vs. line
   infection vs. bilary source in setting of recent transaminitis. Patient
   on chronic steroids and recent proctitis/bowel prep overnight raising
   concern for bowel perferation. KUB limited by motion. Exam limited by
   chronic steroid use. CVP 7, lactate 2.1 --> w/ IVF and levophed,
   decreased UOP.

   #. Lower GI Bleeding: HCT has been stable, plan had been for scope
   today. Etiology unclear - possibly rectal fissure, proctitis, colitis,
   diverticular, hemorrhoids.
   - f/u GI recs, will hold off on scope in setting of sepsis
   - maintain active type and cross
   - continue to follow Hct Q12 Hours

   #. Hyperbilirubinemia / elevated transaminases: No prior history per
   PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] is status-post cholecystectomy. LFTs stably elevated,
   although T. bili continues to improve. Prior to transfer to ICU
   methimazole and azathioprine were discontinued and predisone lowered
   as medications were thought to be playing a role. Diff includes PBC,
   drug induced liver disease (methimazole, AZT, chronic prednisone),
   autoimmune hepatitis, congestive hepatitis (given cardiomegaly, SOB,
   recent CP), PSC.
   - f/u GI evaluation, consider liver consult once sepsis resolved

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, hypertension, and hyperthyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, abdominal pain, leukocytosis, and bright red blood per rectum.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis is likely caused by a gastrointestinal (GI) source, but the exact source is unknown. She is at risk for developing organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, renal failure, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Pain control: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain, which needs to be managed effectively to prevent further complications.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has multiple ecchymoses, which may indicate impaired skin integrity and increase her risk of developing pressure ulcers.
4. Asthma: The patient has a history of asthma, which may exacerbate her respiratory status in the ICU.
5. Arthritis, rheumatoid (RA): The patient has a history of RA, which may affect her mobility and increase her risk of developing pressure ulcers.
6. Hypertension, benign: The patient has a history of hypertension, which may increase her risk of developing cardiovascular complications in the ICU.
7. Anxiety: The patient has a history of anxiety and depression, which may affect her mental status and increase her risk of developing delirium in the ICU.
8. Lower GI bleeding: The patient has a history of lower GI bleeding, which may be caused by a rectal fissure, proctitis, colitis, diverticular disease, or hemorrhoids.
9. Hyperbilirubinemia and elevated transaminases: The patient has a history of hyperbilirubinemia and elevated transaminases, which may indicate liver dysfunction or damage.
10. Hyperthyroidism: The patient has a history of hyperthyroidism, which may increase her risk of developing cardiovascular complications in the ICU.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 14.3-33.3 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 24.1-30.9%
* Plt: 248-326 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 0.6-0.9 mg/dL
* TCO2: 19-25 mmol/L
* Glucose: 53-173 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
* Albumin: 1.9 g/dL
* LDH: 378 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.0 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.0 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CT abdomen/pelvis: Small perihepatic free fluid, new from prior study. No evidence of obstruction, pneumatosis, or free air. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis/consolidation of the adjacent lungs.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Goal-directed therapy, including IVF bolus to achieve a CVP of 12
* Coverage with vancomycin and Zosyn
* Stress dose steroids with hydrocortisone 100 mg IV Q8H
* F/u blood cultures, send urine once specimen available, sputum CX if possible, and blood cultures from triple lumen
* Maintain MAP > 65 with levophed
* Repeat ABG, lactate, and SvO2
* Consider resiting of line

Overall, the patient is at risk for developing multiple medical complications, including sepsis, organ dysfunction, pain, and skin integrity issues. She requires close monitoring and aggressive management of her symptoms to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or hepatic dysfunction
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
* Hyperthyroidism-related complications, such as arrhythmias, tachycardia, or thyrotoxic crisis
* Hypothyroidism-related complications, such as bradycardia, hypotension, or cretinism
* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia
* Electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia
* Renal failure or acute kidney injury
* Respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to monitor her closely and adjust therapy as needed to prevent or manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, hypertension, and hyperthyroidism. She presented to the hospital with abdominal pain, leukocytosis, and bright red blood per rectum, and was subsequently transferred to the ICU for septic shock.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.6°C, HR 88 bpm, BP 114/55 mmHg, RR 19 breaths/min, SpO2 99%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 6 mmHg, MAP 55 mmHg
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula oxygen
* Laboratory results: WBC 14.3, Hct 30.9, Plt 297, Cr 0.9, TCO2 19, Glucose 173 mg/dL
* Imaging studies: CT abdomen/pelvis shows small perihepatic free fluid, new from prior study, and small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis/consolidation of the adjacent lungs

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Septic shock: Source most likely GI, with concern for bacterial translocation due to chronic steroids and recent proctitis/bowel prep
* New-onset atrial fibrillation: Developed in setting of sepsis, with concern for obstructive jaundice
* Lower GI bleeding: Etiology unclear, possibly due to rectal fissure, proctitis, colitis, diverticular disease, or hemorrhoids
* Hyperbilirubinemia/elevated transaminases: No prior history, with possible causes including PBC, drug-induced liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, or congestive hepatitis
* Hyperthyroidism: Off methimazole for 2 days, with concern for transaminitis
* Esophagitis: Likely due to chronic prednisone
* Hyponatremia: Chronic, unclear etiology
* Asthma: Appears well-controlled
* Hypertension: Normally on Metoprolol and Lisinopril
* Anxiety/depression: On Xanax at home, with recent anxiety reported on the day prior to transfer

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Continued septic shock and organ dysfunction
* Development of acute kidney injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome
* Progression of lower GI bleeding and potential need for surgical intervention
* Worsening of hyperthyroidism and potential need for further treatment
* Development of hepatic encephalopathy or coagulopathy due to liver dysfunction
* Prolonged hospitalization and increased risk of nosocomial infections
* Potential need for further imaging studies, such as MRI or CT, to evaluate liver and pancreatic function

Based on this information, the patient's treatment plan should include:

* Continued antibiotics and supportive care for septic shock
* Management of atrial fibrillation, including consideration of cardioversion or anticoagulation
* Further evaluation and management of lower GI bleeding, including possible endoscopy or colonoscopy
* Management of hyperthyroidism, including consideration of further treatment options
* Monitoring and management of hyperbilirubinemia and elevated transaminases
* Management of esophagitis, including consideration of antifungal therapy
* Monitoring and management of hyponatremia
* Continued management of asthma and hypertension
* Consideration of social work consult and prn benzodiazepines for anxiety and depression

Close monitoring of the patient's condition and laboratory results is essential to guide treatment and prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a multi-lumen catheter inserted, demonstrating small perihepatic free fluid, bilateral pleural effusions, and atelectasis/consolidation of adjacent lungs. They have been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute pain, impaired skin integrity, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, anxiety, and a history of cholecystitis, peripheral neuropathy, upper gastrointestinal bleed, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis without organ dysfunction is a concern, as it may progress to septic shock or organ dysfunction if not managed promptly and effectively.
2. Infection: The presence of bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis/consolidation of adjacent lungs increases the risk of infection, particularly pneumonia.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with a history of asthma and chronic pain, which may exacerbate respiratory compromise.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hyperdynamic LV systolic dysfunction and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension may indicate cardiovascular instability, which requires close monitoring and management.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of peripheral neuropathy and chronic pain may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as neuropathic pain, numbness, or weakness.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of upper gastrointestinal bleed and gastroesophageal reflux disease increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be exacerbated by anticoagulation therapy.
7. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk for VTE due to their prolonged immobility and anticoagulation therapy, which requires close monitoring and prophylactic measures.

These potential complications highlight the importance of close monitoring and management of the patient's condition, as well as the need for ongoing assessment and adjustments to their treatment plan to prevent or mitigate these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a septic patient with multi-lumen catheter placement, small perihepatic free fluid, and bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis/consolidation of the adjacent lungs. They have hyperdynamic LV systolic dysfunction with an abnormal systolic flow contour, mild mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The patient has persistent tachycardia (AFib) despite coming off of Levophed and fluid boluses, and has been started on amiodarone.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 114/55 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 19 inspirations per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's coagulation profile shows elevated PT and PTT, and the patient's electrolyte profile shows mild hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia.

The patient has a history of sepsis, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, anxiety, and neurological disorders. The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, upper, and has a history of cholecystitis and peripheral neuropathy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and coagulopathy.
2. Cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac failure.
3. Gastrointestinal complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, and necrosis.
4. Neurological complications, including seizures, encephalopathy, and peripheral neuropathy.
5. Respiratory complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, and respiratory failure.
6. Hematological complications, including disseminated intravascular coagulation, bleeding diathesis, and thrombocytopenia.
7. Endocrine complications, including adrenal insufficiency, thyroid storm, and hyperthyroidism.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, hypertension, and hyperthyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, likely due to gastrointestinal (GI) source, and is being treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate 64 bpm, blood pressure 119/78 mmHg, respiratory rate 30 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 100% on 2L nasal cannula.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) 11 mmHg, and lactate 1.2 mmol/L.
* Laboratory results: White blood cell count (WBC) 15.5 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin (Hb) 8.1 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) 271 x 10^9/L, and liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase) elevated.
* Physical examination: The patient is drowsy, with waxing and waning levels of consciousness, and responds to verbal stimuli. She has intermittent groaning of pain and is tender in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) of the abdomen.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction (e.g., acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, or hepatic dysfunction)
* GI bleeding, which may be due to rectal fissure, proctitis, colitis, diverticular disease, or hemorrhoids
* Hyperbilirubinemia and elevated transaminases, which may be due to drug-induced liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, or congestive hepatitis
* Hyponatremia, which may be due to chronic, unclear etiology
* Anxiety and depression, which may worsen with the patient's current condition
* Hypertension, which may require further management

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Goal-directed therapy, including IV fluid boluses to achieve a CVP of 12 mmHg
* Stress dose steroids to decrease to hydrocortisone 50mg IV every 8 hours
* Maintenance of mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 mmHg
* Repeat ABG, lactate, and SvO2 measurements
* Monitoring of liver function tests and trending of LFTs
* Consideration of liver consult and MRCP to evaluate intrinsic liver disease and assess the pancreas and biliary tree
* Discussion with endocrinology regarding further treatment for hyperthyroidism and risk of planned contrast load
* Social work consult for anxiety and depression
* Consideration of prn benzodiazepine for anxiety and depression

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her complex medical conditions to prevent further complications and improve her clinical outcome."

   # Septic Shock: Thought source most likely GI with concern for
   bacterial translocation. CVPand lactate improved today. MRSA bacteremia
   today however ?from line placed in ED.
   - cover with vanc/zosyn
 check vanc trough prior to PM dose. D/C
   flagyl.
   - TTE to assess for endocarditis
   - Place PICC for long-term abx treatment
   - Goal directed therapy, IVF bolus to acheive CVP of 12
   - Was started on stress dose steroids as was on chronic prednisone for
   RA. Will change back to home regimen today.
   - f/u cx sensitivities
   - maintain MAP>65

   PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] is status-post cholecystectomy. LFTs slowly improving;
   negative Ab for autoimmune hepatitis, PSC, and viral hepatitis. Ddx
   includes drug induced liver disease (methimazole and AZT
 recently
   discontinued, chronic prednisone
 recently lowered) or, congestive
   hepatitis
   - Trend LFTs
   - f/u GI recs, consider liver consult once sepsis resolved if persists
   - Consider MRCP to evaluate intrinsic liver disease and assessment of
   pancreas and biliary tree
   - Restart methimazole when more stable

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, hypertension, and hyperthyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, likely due to bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: On nasal cannula oxygen, with SpO2 of 100%.
* Cardiovascular: In sinus rhythm, with a blood pressure of 119/78 mmHg and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 11 mmHg.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) is being targeted at 65 mmHg.
* Laboratory results: The patient has a white blood cell count of 15.5, hemoglobin of 8.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 271 K/uL. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 56 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 51 IU/L.
* Infections: The patient has a MRSA bacteremia, which is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of abdominal pain, leukocytosis, and bright red blood per rectum, and is being treated for septic shock. She is also at risk for lower gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Endocrine: The patient has a history of hyperthyroidism, which is being treated with methimazole. She has recently been off methimazole for two days, which may have contributed to her transaminitis.
* Psychiatric: The patient is anxious and has a history of depression, for which she is taking Xanax.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is being treated, but she is at risk for further complications, such as organ failure and death.
* Lower gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of abdominal pain, leukocytosis, and bright red blood per rectum puts her at risk for further bleeding.
* Endocarditis: The patient's MRSA bacteremia puts her at risk for endocarditis, which would require further treatment.
* Liver failure: The patient's elevated LFTs and history of liver disease put her at risk for liver failure.
* Pancreatitis: The patient's history of hyperthyroidism and recent discontinuation of methimazole may have contributed to her elevated LFTs, which could also be indicative of pancreatitis.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hyperthyroidism and recent discontinuation of methimazole may put her at risk for hypothyroidism.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued treatment for septic shock, including vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.
* Placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) for long-term antibiotic treatment.
* Goal-directed therapy, including IV fluids and vasopressors, to target a CVP of 12 mmHg.
* Stress dose steroids to treat adrenal insufficiency.
* Monitoring of the patient's LFTs and liver function.
* Consideration of liver biopsy or MRCP to evaluate intrinsic liver disease and assess the pancreas and biliary tree.
* Restarting of methimazole when more stable.
* Discussion with the endocrine team regarding further treatment options for hyperthyroidism."
