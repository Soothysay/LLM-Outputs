   Chief Complaint:
   76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to OSH w/ PNA and
   ARF, now transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI. S/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90%
   stenosis.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient had a new A-line and left subclavian central line placed
   and his old lines pulled.  Cath tip was sent for Cx.  He was started on
   lopressor 12.5 mg tid and lipitor 80 mg daily.  He was started on
   atrovent (xopeniex can't be given to patients on a vent).  He received
   a dose of 20 mg IV lasix in the cath lab yesterday am and another dose
   of 20 mg IV yesterday evening.  He remained on the ventilator on AC
   setting.  Did not start an acei given his recent ARF and the dye load
   he received at cath.  Will need a head CT when he is more stable as the
   head CT was never completed at the OSH.   He will need a TTE tomorrow.
   His CE continued to climb from CK 262 --> 511 --> 714    and CK-MB of
   19 -->50-->80 and MB index of 7.3 --> 9.8 -->11.2.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the emergency department with pneumonia and acute renal failure. He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and diagnosed with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent two balloon angioplasty procedures to the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) artery with 90% stenosis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 98.1°F, heart rate 75 beats per minute, blood pressure 119/50 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 96%.
* Laboratory results: White blood cell count 11.7 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin 10.5 g/dL, creatinine 1.4 mg/dL, and troponin T 0.64 ng/mL.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. He has a right-sided pleural effusion and is receiving lasix boluses as needed.
* Respiratory status: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, with a carbon dioxide (CO2) level of 104 mmHg on arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis.
* Renal status: The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL.
* Neurological status: The patient has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12, with a decreased level of consciousness and a possible right eye gaze and right upper extremity weakness.
* Other medical conditions: The patient has a history of depression and is taking celexa.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's STEMI and subsequent balloon angioplasty procedures may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac tamponade.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation may lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, or respiratory failure.
* Renal complications: The patient's acute renal failure may lead to worsening renal function, electrolyte imbalances, or the need for dialysis.
* Neurological complications: The patient's decreased level of consciousness and possible right eye gaze and right upper extremity weakness may lead to neurological deterioration, seizures, or stroke.
* Infections: The patient's pneumonia and possible sepsis may lead to secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
* Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and possible bleeding complications may lead to bleeding at the catheterization site, gastrointestinal bleeding, or intracranial bleeding.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions and potential complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications, and to ensure the patient's optimal recovery."

   Chief Complaint:
   76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to OSH w/ PNA and
   ARF, now transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI. S/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90%
   stenosis.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient had a new A-line and left subclavian central line placed
   and his old lines pulled.  Cath tip was sent for Cx.  He was started on
   lopressor 12.5 mg tid and lipitor 80 mg daily.  He was started on
   atrovent (xopeniex can't be given to patients on a vent).  He received
   a dose of 20 mg IV lasix in the cath lab yesterday am and another dose
   of 20 mg IV yesterday evening.  He remained on the ventilator on AC
   setting.  Did not start an acei given his recent ARF and the dye load
   he received at cath.  Will need a head CT when he is more stable as the
   head CT was never completed at the OSH.   He will need a TTE tomorrow.
   His CE continued to climb from CK 262 --> 511 --> 714  and CK-MB of 19
   -->50-->80 and MB index of 7.3 --> 9.8 -->11.2.  Last night the
   radiologist from the OSH called and reported that the head CT he had
   there showed no bleed, but that the left maxillary sinus was completely
   opacified with thickening of the walls and soft tissue expanding into
   the cavity with a hyperdensity at the anterior aspect of the soft
   tissue.
   This am the patient remains intubated and sedated.  His RR was
   increased from 12 to 16 given CO2 retention and acidosis on ABG.

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to OSH w/ PNA and
   ARF, now transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI. S/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90%
   stenosis.
   #. CAD - Pt w/ STEMI, now s/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90% stenosis. On cath,
   Fick CO 6.73, CI 3.20. Anatomy also w/ proximally occluded RCA w/
   robust collaterals.
   - daily ASA and Plavix
   - high-dose statin
   - lopressor TID, titrate up PRN
   - consider starting ACE-I once his ARF resolves
   - Insulin SS for blood sugar control
   - Lasix boluses PRN
   #  Hemodynamics/Leukocytosis
 The patient was initially on pressors
   for hypotension, but then was switched to a nitro gtt to control
   hypertension.  His SBP has been trending downward and he is now off the
   nitro gtt with SBPs in the 110s.  His SVR has been calculated to be 461
   (down from 624) which is concerning for possible sepsis.  He has
   remained afebrile, however his WBC has risen to 14.5 this am (from 10.5
 11.7).  His differential is left-shifted with 86.4%N.
   - F/U BCx, cath tip Cx, UA, UCx, sputum Cx
   - If he becomes hypotensive or spikes a fever, consider broadening his
   antibiotic coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   #. Pneumonia - Pt w/ RLL pneumonia at OSH, started on Levoflox (day 1
   [**12-27**]).
   - cont Levofloxacin 750mg x5d
    #. Hypercarbic respiratory failure - Pt intubated at OSH for CO2 >100
   on ABG. The patient continues to remain CO2 on the ventilator.  The
   patient does not have a history of COPD, but had smoked in the past.
   - Ipratropium q6h
   - would like to give Xopenex, however this is not available for
   ventilated patients (holding albuterol given his recent STEMI)
   - serial ABGs
   - Abx as above for pneumonia
   - Consider steroids for a possible COPD exacerbation
   - repeat CXR
   #. Acute renal failure - Creatinine on arrival to OSH was elevated to
   1.5.  Here he improved to 1.2, however he had received dye at the cath
   lab yesterday and this am his Cr is increased to 1.4.  Unknown
   baseline.  His UOP also has been decreasing.  Given his possible sepsis
   he could have prerenal ARF (it is early for CIN, however this could be
   an expected cause of the next couple of days).  FEurea was 26.3% which
   suggests a prerenal etiology.
   -
   - Consider renal US to rule out postrenal causes of ARF.
   #. Diabetes - On PO Metformin at home, was on insulin gtt at OSH ICU.
   - Holding home Metformin
   - Lantus 10 units with SSI coverage for tight blood sugar control
   #. ?Right eye gaze & RUE weakness
 Had a noncontrast Head CT at OSH
   prior to transfer.  Spoke with the radiologist who stated that the head
   CT showed no evidence for bleed.  Will defer further imaging until the
   patient is off sedation and his neurologic status can be assessed by
   exam.
   #. Depression - Continue home Celexa.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   he could have prerenal ARF (it is early for CIN, however this could be
   an expected cause of the next couple of days).  FEurea was 26.3% which
   suggests a prerenal etiology.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia who was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and acute respiratory failure (ARF). He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and diagnosed with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with two stents placed in the mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient remains intubated and sedated due to respiratory failure.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK) and troponin T, indicating myocardial damage. His cardiac enzymes are increasing, with a CK-MB index of 11.2, suggesting ongoing myocardial damage.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 104 mmHg on arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. His oxygen saturation is 96% on 40% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2).

The patient's hemodynamic status is also concerning, with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 119 mmHg and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 15 mmHg. His mean arterial pressure (MAP) is 83 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results also show evidence of sepsis, with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 14.5 x 10^9/L and a left-shifted differential count. His lactate level is 1.1 mmol/L, which is slightly elevated.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Continued myocardial damage and infarction
	* Cardiogenic shock
	* Heart failure
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Pneumonia
	* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
	* Respiratory failure
3. Sepsis-related complications:
	* Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction
	* Sepsis-induced cardiogenic shock
	* Sepsis-induced respiratory failure
4. Renal complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI)
	* Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
5. Neurological complications:
	* Cerebral edema
	* Seizures
	* Stroke
6. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding
	* Pancreatitis
7. Hematological complications:
	* Thrombocytopenia
	* Coagulopathy

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage potential complications."

   stenosis.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient had a new A-line and left subclavian central line placed
   and his old lines pulled.  Cath tip was sent for Cx.  He was started on
   lopressor 12.5 mg tid and lipitor 80 mg daily.  He was started on
   atrovent (xopeniex can't be given to patients on a vent).  He received
   a dose of 20 mg IV lasix in the cath lab yesterday am and another dose
   of 20 mg IV yesterday evening.  He remained on the ventilator on AC
   setting.  Did not start an acei given his recent ARF and the dye load
   he received at cath.   His CE continued to climb from CK 262 --> 511
   --> 714  and CK-MB of 19 -->50-->80 and MB index of 7.3 --> 9.8
   -->11.2.  Last night the radiologist from the OSH called and reported
   that the head CT he had there showed no bleed, but that the left
   maxillary sinus was completely opacified with thickening of the walls
   and soft tissue expanding into the cavity with a hyperdensity at the
   anterior aspect of the soft tissue.  The patient was weaned off the
   nitro gtt as his pressures decreased overnight.
   This am the patient remains intubated and sedated.  His RR was
   increased from 12 to 16 given CO2 retention and acidosis on ABG.

   #. Hypercarbic respiratory failure/Likely COPD
 The patient was found
   at the OSH to be hypoxic with a very elevated CO2 and was intubated.
   Has been intubated since then with some CO2 retention on the AC

s, it is likely that he
   will be able to tolerate being extubated today.   Patient does no have
   wheezing on exam today.
   -  Will change his vent to Pressure support [**5-17**] and recheck a RISB and
   ABG in a few hours.  If they look okay, can plan to extubated him later
   today.

   he could have prerenal ARF (it is early for CIN, however this could be

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to OSH w/ PNA and
   ARF, now transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI. S/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90%
   stenosis.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient had a new A-line and left subclavian central line placed
   and his old lines pulled.  Cath tip was sent for Cx.  He was started on
   lopressor 12.5 mg tid and lipitor 80 mg daily.  He was started on
   atrovent (xopeniex can't be given to patients on a vent).  He received
   a dose of 20 mg IV lasix in the cath lab yesterday am and another dose
   of 20 mg IV yesterday evening.  He remained on the ventilator on AC
   setting.  Did not start an acei given his recent ARF and the dye load
   he received at cath.   His CE continued to climb from CK 262 --> 511
   --> 714  and CK-MB of 19 -->50-->80 and MB index of 7.3 --> 9.8
   -->11.2.  Last night the radiologist from the OSH called and reported
   that the head CT he had there showed no bleed, but that the left
   maxillary sinus was completely opacified with thickening of the walls
   and soft tissue expanding into the cavity with a hyperdensity at the
   anterior aspect of the soft tissue.  The patient was weaned off the
   nitro gtt as his pressures decreased overnight.
   This am the patient remains intubated and sedated.  His RR was
   increased from 12 to 16 given CO2 retention and acidosis on ABG.

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to OSH w/ PNA and
   ARF, now transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI. S/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90%
   stenosis.
   #. Hypercarbic respiratory failure/Likely COPD
 The patient was found
   at the OSH to be hypoxic with a very elevated CO2 and was intubated.
   Has been intubated since then with some CO2 retention on the AC
   setting.  As his RISB this am was in the 20
s, it is likely that he
   will be able to tolerate being extubated today.   Patient does no have
   wheezing on exam today.
   -  Will change his vent to Pressure support [**5-17**] and recheck a RISB and
   ABG in a few hours.  If they look okay, can plan to extubated him later
   today.
   -  Patient no longer requires the pulmonary artery catheter.  Will
   remove this and his groin line today.
   -  Ipratropium q6h
   -  would like to give Xopenex, however this is not available for
   ventilated patients (holding albuterol given his recent STEMI)
   -  Abx as below for pneumonia
   #. CAD - Pt w/ STEMI, now s/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90% stenosis. Anatomy
   also w/ proximally occluded RCA w/ robust collaterals.  CKs peaked on
   [**12-29**] at 714.
   - Continue daily ASA and Plavix
   - Continue high-dose statin, lopressor 12.5 mg tid
   - Will get a TTE today to assess his heart function
   - consider starting ACE-I once his ARF resolves if his EF is depressed
   on echo
   - Insulin as below for tight blood sugar control
   #  Hemodynamics/Leukocytosis
 The patient was initially on pressors
   for hypotension, but then was switched to a nitro gtt to control
   hypertension.  His SBP has been trending downward and he is now off the
   nitro gtt with SBPs in the 110s.  His SVR has been calculated to be 461
   (down from 624) which is concerning for possible sepsis.  He has
   remained afebrile, however his WBC has risen to 14.5 this am (from 10.5
 11.7).  His differential is left-shifted with 86.4%N.
   - F/U BCx, cath tip Cx, UA, UCx, sputum Cx
   - If he becomes hypotensive or spikes a fever, consider broadening his
   antibiotic coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Hold off further diuresis with lasix.
   #. Pneumonia - Pt w/ RLL pneumonia at OSH, started on Levoflox (day 1
   [**12-27**]).  CXR this am looks unchanged with no new infiltrates or pleural
   effusions.
   - Cont Levofloxacin 750mg x5d
   #. Acute renal failure - Creatinine on arrival to OSH was elevated to
   1.5.  Here he improved to 1.2, however he had received dye at the cath
   lab yesterday and this am his Cr is increased to 1.4.  Unknown

   he could have prerenal ARF (it is early for CIN, however this could be
   an expected cause of the next couple of days).  FEurea was 26.3% which
   suggests a prerenal etiology.
   - Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins.
   #. Diabetes - On PO Metformin at home, was on insulin gtt at OSH ICU.
   - Holding home Metformin
   - Lantus 10 units with SSI coverage for tight blood sugar control
   #. ?Right eye gaze & RUE weakness
 Had a noncontrast Head CT at OSH
   prior to transfer.  Spoke with the radiologist who stated that the head
   CT showed no evidence for bleed.  Will defer further imaging until the

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a complex medical history, including hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. He was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and acute respiratory failure, and was subsequently diagnosed with a ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and sedated, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 260. He has been on the ventilator for 24 hours and has shown some improvement in his respiratory status, with a decreased respiratory rate and improved oxygen saturation.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of STEMI and has undergone PCI with stenting. His creatine kinase (CK) levels have peaked at 714, and his troponin-T levels have increased to 1.24 ng/mL. He is currently on aspirin, clopidogrel, and statins.
* Renal: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL. His urine output has decreased, and he is currently receiving diuretic therapy.
* Neurological: The patient has a history of right eye gaze and right upper extremity weakness, which is thought to be related to his underlying medical conditions. He is currently sedated and unable to assess his neurological status.
* Infection: The patient has a diagnosis of pneumonia, which was treated with levofloxacin. He has also been receiving antibiotics for sepsis.
* Hemodynamics: The patient has been on pressors for hypotension, but has since been switched to nitroglycerin to control hypertension. His systolic blood pressure has been trending downward, and he is currently off the nitroglycerin.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and he may require continued ventilatory support.
* Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of STEMI and has undergone PCI with stenting. He may be at risk for cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
* Renal failure: The patient has AKI, and his creatinine level is increasing. He may require further diuretic therapy or dialysis.
* Sepsis: The patient has a diagnosis of sepsis, and his white blood cell count has increased. He may be at risk for further complications, such as organ failure or death.
* Neurological complications: The patient has a history of right eye gaze and right upper extremity weakness, which may be related to his underlying medical conditions. He may be at risk for further neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

* Continue ventilatory support to maintain the patient's respiratory status.
* Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, and consider further interventions, such as heart failure therapy or arrhythmia management.
* Continue diuretic therapy to manage the patient's AKI, and consider further interventions, such as dialysis.
* Continue antibiotics to treat the patient's sepsis, and consider further interventions, such as surgical debridement or wound care.
* Monitor the patient's neurological status closely, and consider further interventions, such as physical therapy or occupational therapy to manage his right eye gaze and right upper extremity weakness.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:

 PA CATHETER - STOP [**2190-12-30**] 09:15 AM
   R groin line removed and tip sent for culture. Pt extubated
   successfully in the afternoon.  Was wheezy on exam but mostly upper
   airway, treated with nebs.  MS [**First Name (Titles) 3347**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3348**] but PCO2 okay.
   Sputum shows 4+ GPCs on gram stain.  Had elevated blood pressures in
   the 180s in the afternoon.  Got Labetolol 20mg IV, then Hydralazine
   10mg IV X 1, then nitro gtt.  BPs trended down to 150s-160s on nitro.
   At 1am was more tachycardic with HR in the 100s, got Metoprolol 12.5mg
   PO X 1 w/o significant improvement.  Pt responded well to Captopril
   12.5mg w/ SBP in 120s, off nitroglycerin now.
   Nurse noted at midnight that pt had a L facial droop after taking off
   face mask.  Speech garbled but coherent.  Neuro exam per covering
   intern
pupils equal, L facial droop with asymmetry of forehead.
   Diffuse muscle weakness upper and lower extremities, strong hand grasp
   and equal on both sides. Hyperactive reflexes with clonus of lower
   extremities bl.  Upgoing Babinskis.  No focal deficits
.  ABG checked
   for concerns for hypercarbia and was 7.44/40/73/28.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the emergency department with pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. He was diagnosed with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent balloon angioplasty and stenting of the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) artery. He was extubated and now has a left-sided hemiparesis and facial droop. His laboratory results show elevated blood pressure, kidney function, and cardiac enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's ABG results show a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 40 mmHg, indicating hypercarbia. This could lead to respiratory acidosis and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture shows growth of Gram-positive cocci (GPCs) and Gram-negative rods (GNRs), which could indicate a severe infection.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's STEMI and LAD stenting may have caused cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction. This could lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and uremic syndrome.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's left hemiparesis and facial droop could indicate a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or other neurological disorder.
6. Hemorrhagic conversion: The patient's anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy may increase the risk of hemorrhagic conversion of a CVA.
7. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and granular casts on urinalysis suggest a possible infection.
8. Diabetic complications: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating poor control. This could lead to further complications such as ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, or diabetic nephropathy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide supportive care as needed.
2. Administer antibiotics for pneumonia and adjust therapy based on culture results.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust therapy as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust therapy as needed.
5. Consider imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the patient's neurological status.
6. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust therapy as needed to maintain tight control.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust therapy as needed to prevent imbalances.
8. Consider consulting with a specialist such as a cardiologist, nephrologist, or neurologist to provide additional guidance on the patient's care."

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to OSH w/ PNA and
   ARF, now transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI. S/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90%
   stenosis.
   #. Hypercarbic respiratory failure/Likely COPD
 The patient was found
   at the OSH to be hypoxic with a very elevated CO2 and was intubated.
   Has been intubated since then with some CO2 retention on the AC
   setting.  As his RISB this am was in the 20
s, it is likely that he
   will be able to tolerate being extubated today.   Patient does no have
   wheezing on exam today.
   -  Will change his vent to Pressure support [**5-17**] and recheck a RISB and
   ABG in a few hours.  If they look okay, can plan to extubated him later
   today.
   -  Patient no longer requires the pulmonary artery catheter.  Will
   remove this and his groin line today.
   -  Ipratropium q6h
   -  would like to give Xopenex, however this is not available for
   ventilated patients (holding albuterol given his recent STEMI)
   -  Abx as below for pneumonia
   #. CAD - Pt w/ STEMI, now s/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90% stenosis. Anatomy
   also w/ proximally occluded RCA w/ robust collaterals.  CKs peaked on
   [**12-29**] at 714.
   - Continue daily ASA and Plavix
   - Continue high-dose statin, lopressor 12.5 mg tid
   - Will get a TTE today to assess his heart function
   - consider starting ACE-I once his ARF resolves if his EF is depressed
   on echo
   - Insulin as below for tight blood sugar control
   #  Hemodynamics/Leukocytosis
 The patient was initially on pressors
   for hypotension, but then was switched to a nitro gtt to control
   hypertension.  His SBP has been trending downward and he is now off the
   nitro gtt with SBPs in the 110s.  His SVR has been calculated to be 461
   (down from 624) which is concerning for possible sepsis.  He has
   remained afebrile, however his WBC has risen to 14.5 this am (from 10.5
 11.7).  His differential is left-shifted with 86.4%N.
   - F/U BCx, cath tip Cx, UA, UCx, sputum Cx
   - If he becomes hypotensive or spikes a fever, consider broadening his
   antibiotic coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Hold off further diuresis with lasix.
   #. Pneumonia - Pt w/ RLL pneumonia at OSH, started on Levoflox (day 1
   [**12-27**]).  CXR this am looks unchanged with no new infiltrates or pleural
   effusions.
   - Cont Levofloxacin 750mg x5d
   #. Acute renal failure - Creatinine on arrival to OSH was elevated to
   1.5.  Here he improved to 1.2, however he had received dye at the cath
   lab yesterday and this am his Cr is increased to 1.4.  Unknown
   baseline.  His UOP also has been decreasing.  Given his possible sepsis
   he could have prerenal ARF (it is early for CIN, however this could be
   an expected cause of the next couple of days).  FEurea was 26.3% which
   suggests a prerenal etiology.
   - Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins.
   #. Diabetes - On PO Metformin at home, was on insulin gtt at OSH ICU.
   - Holding home Metformin
   - Lantus 10 units with SSI coverage for tight blood sugar control
   #. ?Right eye gaze & RUE weakness
 Had a noncontrast Head CT at OSH
   prior to transfer.  Spoke with the radiologist who stated that the head
   CT showed no evidence for bleed.  Will defer further imaging until the
   patient is off sedation and his neurologic status can be assessed by
   exam.
   #. Depression - Continue home Celexa.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to OSH w/ PNA and
   ARF, now transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI. S/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90%
   stenosis.
   #. Hypercarbic respiratory failure/Likely COPD
 The patient was found
   at the OSH to be hypoxic with a very elevated CO2 and was intubated.
   Has been intubated since then with some CO2 retention on the AC
   setting.  As his RISB this am was in the 20
s, it is likely that he
   will be able to tolerate being extubated today.   Patient does no have
   wheezing on exam today.
   -  Will change his vent to Pressure support [**5-17**] and recheck a RISB and
   ABG in a few hours.  If they look okay, can plan to extubated him later
   today.
   -  Patient no longer requires the pulmonary artery catheter.  Will
   remove this and his groin line today.
   -  Ipratropium q6h
   -  would like to give Xopenex, however this is not available for
   ventilated patients (holding albuterol given his recent STEMI)
   -  Abx as below for pneumonia
   #. CAD - Pt w/ STEMI, now s/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90% stenosis. Anatomy
   also w/ proximally occluded RCA w/ robust collaterals.  CKs peaked on
   [**12-29**] at 714.
   - Continue daily ASA and Plavix
   - Continue high-dose statin, lopressor 12.5 mg tid
   - Will get a TTE today to assess his heart function
   - consider starting ACE-I once his ARF resolves if his EF is depressed
   on echo
   - Insulin as below for tight blood sugar control
   #  Hemodynamics/Leukocytosis
 The patient was initially on pressors
   for hypotension, but then was switched to a nitro gtt to control
   hypertension.  His SBP has been trending downward and he is now off the
   nitro gtt with SBPs in the 110s.  His SVR has been calculated to be 461
   (down from 624) which is concerning for possible sepsis.  He has
   remained afebrile, however his WBC has risen to 14.5 this am (from 10.5
 11.7).  His differential is left-shifted with 86.4%N.
   - F/U BCx, cath tip Cx, UA, UCx, sputum Cx
   - If he becomes hypotensive or spikes a fever, consider broadening his
   antibiotic coverage with vanc and zosyn.
   - Hold off further diuresis with lasix.
   #. Pneumonia - Pt w/ RLL pneumonia at OSH, started on Levoflox (day 1
   [**12-27**]).  CXR this am looks unchanged with no new infiltrates or pleural
   effusions.
   - Cont Levofloxacin 750mg x5d
   #. Acute renal failure - Creatinine on arrival to OSH was elevated to
   1.5.  Here he improved to 1.2, however he had received dye at the cath
   lab yesterday and this am his Cr is increased to 1.4.  Unknown
   baseline.  His UOP also has been decreasing.  Given his possible sepsis
   he could have prerenal ARF (it is early for CIN, however this could be
   an expected cause of the next couple of days).  FEurea was 26.3% which
   suggests a prerenal etiology.
   - Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins.
   #. Diabetes - On PO Metformin at home, was on insulin gtt at OSH ICU.
   - Holding home Metformin
   - Lantus 10 units with SSI coverage for tight blood sugar control
   #. ?Right eye gaze & RUE weakness
 Had a noncontrast Head CT at OSH
   prior to transfer.  Spoke with the radiologist who stated that the head
   CT showed no evidence for bleed.  Will defer further imaging until the
   patient is off sedation and his neurologic status can be assessed by
   exam.
   #. Depression - Continue home Celexa.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient, a 76-year-old male, was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to COPD. He was intubated and received mechanical ventilation. The patient underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting for a STEMI.

The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 122/56 mmHg. He was receiving oxygen therapy and had a SpO2 of 94%. His respiratory status improved, and he was extubated successfully in the afternoon.

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK) and troponin-T, indicating myocardial injury. His complete blood count (CBC) showed a white blood cell count of 14.5 x 10^9/L, which is concerning for possible sepsis.

The patient's medical conditions included hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. He was receiving various medications, including anticoagulants, beta-blockers, and diuretics.

The patient's physical examination showed a right facial droop, with a small but reactive pupil. His neurologic examination was normal, except for diffuse muscle weakness in the upper and lower extremities.

The patient's medical plan included:

1. Continue daily ASA and Plavix for CAD.
2. Continue high-dose statin and lopressor for CAD.
3. Get a TTE to assess heart function.
4. Consider starting ACE-I if EF is depressed on echo.
5. Continue insulin therapy for tight blood sugar control.
6. Monitor for signs of sepsis and adjust antibiotic coverage as necessary.
7. Continue to trend creatinine and avoid nephrotoxins.
8. Hold off further diuresis with lasix.
9. Continue Levofloxacin for pneumonia.
10. Monitor for signs of depression and continue home Celexa.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis, which is already suspected based on the patient's elevated white blood cell count and diffuse muscle weakness.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI), which may be caused by the patient's underlying medical conditions or medications.
3. Pneumonia, which is already being treated with antibiotics.
4. Cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias, which may be related to the patient's CAD and STEMI.
5. Neurologic complications, such as stroke or seizures, which may be related to the patient's underlying medical conditions or medications.
6. Respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure or pneumonia, which may be related to the patient's underlying medical conditions or medications.
7. Metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, which may be related to the patient's diabetes and insulin therapy.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve outcomes."

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Aspergillosis: The patient has a rare growth of Aspergillus species in their sputum, which is a concern given their immuno-suppressed state due to diabetes and recent steroid course. This could lead to invasive aspergillosis, which carries a high mortality rate in ICU patients.
2. Left hemiparesis and facial droop: The patient has developed left-sided hemiparesis and facial droop, which could be indicative of a possible CVA (cerebrovascular accident). The lack of sources for this on CTA (computed tomography angiogram) suggests that further workup, such as an MRI, may be necessary to determine the cause.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has had elevated creatinine levels and is at risk for further deterioration due to their underlying kidney disease and potential nephrotoxins.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which could lead to further complications, such as cardiac strain and increased risk of stroke.
5. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, which could lead to diabetic ketoacidosis if not managed properly.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has had a STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) and is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient has COPD exacerbation and is at risk for further respiratory failure, particularly given their elevated oxygen requirements.
8. Sepsis: The patient has a rare growth of Aspergillus species in their sputum, which could indicate a potential sepsis.

Given these potential complications, the patient's treatment plan should focus on managing their hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular risk factors, while also addressing their respiratory and renal issues. Further workup, such as an MRI, may be necessary to determine the cause of their left hemiparesis and facial droop."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient's ACE uptightrated to SBP of < 120.  Pt. received 40mg IV of
   lasix, and diuresed ~ 1.5L up to MN.  Echo showed LVEF 55%, no apical
   akinesis, mild symmetric LVH, Mild PAH.   Given continued wheezing, pt
   started on Prednisone 60mg PO and standing Xopenex.   O/n Sputum Cx
   noted w/ ASPERGILLUS SPECIES, rare growth. Significance of this is
   unclear.  Pt not on LT steroids.  Given recent AMI and concern for
   thrombus, pt was started on heparin gtt w/ transition to coumadin.
   Seen by speech and swallow, who recommended nectar thick, w/ pureed and
   crushed tabs.  Pt noted o/n to have L facial droop and on exam in AM w.
   LUE weakness, LLE weakness, w/ upgoing toes, thus concern regarding
   stroke.  Carotid U/S w/ 60-69% R ICA stenosis, 40-59% L ICA stensosis.
   Neuro consulted: ddx ICH, embolic stroke vs. TIA.  CTA of head/neck
   ordered, showing no ICH, no old CVA, b/l carotid stenosis. Goal SBP

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Stroke: The patient is experiencing left hemiparesis, facial droop, and upgoing toes, which are consistent with a possible CVA. The concern is that the patient may have a hemorrhagic conversion due to anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of RLL pneumonia and is currently receiving antibiotics. The CXR shows an improving effusion, but there is a risk of complications such as sepsis or respiratory failure.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and there is a risk of further decline in renal function. The patient is receiving diuretics and will need to be closely monitored for signs of worsening renal failure.
4. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD exacerbation and is at risk of further respiratory decline. The patient will need to be closely monitored for signs of worsening respiratory failure.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of STEMI and is at risk of further cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
6. Diabetic Complications: The patient has diabetes and is at risk of further complications, such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient has a history of stroke and is at risk of further neurological complications, such as seizures or increased intracranial pressure.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, which increases their risk of cardiovascular and renal complications. The patient is currently receiving anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.

The patient's current medications include:

* Aspirin
* Plavix
* Captopril
* Lopressor
* Insulin
* Metformin
* Lasix
* Prednisone
* Xopenex
* Ipratropium
* Levofloxacin

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 27 mg/dL
* White blood cell count (WBC): 9.4 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 10.5 g/dL
* Platelet count (PLT): 177 x 10^9/L
* Troponin-T: 2.02 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.1 mmol/L

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C
* Heart rate: 78 bpm
* Blood pressure: 141/52 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 95%

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General appearance: Elderly man lying in bed, lethargic
* Cardiovascular: RRR, no MRG. JVP 10
* Respiratory: Coarse breath sounds, wheezing and rhonchi bilaterally
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender
* Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema
* Neurological: Lethargic, impaired attention, A&O x1. EOMs intact informally tested as pt. can follow."

   Chief Complaint: 76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to
   OSH w/ PNA and [**Hospital 3388**] transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI s/p BMS x2 to
   mid-LAD 90% stenosis now with ? of stroke/TIA, a sinus mass, and
   aspergillus in his sputum.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was restarted on a heparing gtt for a left ventricle
   thrombus and coumadin for long-term anticoagulation.  His foley,
   A-line, and central lines were removed.  He was only 300 cc neg at 4pm,
   so he was given 40 mg IV lasix for a goal neg of 1 L.   His prednisone
   was stopped given concern for aspergillosis as aspergillus grew in his
   sputum.  Levofloxacin was stopped as the team does not think he has
   PNA.  ID was consulted due to concern that the mass in his left
   maxillary sinus could be an invasive fungal infection and they
   recommended obtaining an induced sputum and a noncontrast chest CT to
   evaluate for evidence of PNA or aspergillosis.  They also wanted to
   send BCx, Fungal blood Cx, B-glucan, and Galactomman.  As they don't
   think aspergillosis is likely (it may have been a contaminant) they
   want to hold off on treatment for now.  ID recommended consulting ENT
   -  ENT saw the patient and felt that the mass on CT didn't have the
   typical appearance of an aspergillus fungal ball.  She looked in his
   nose and thought it looked like a soft tissue mass (which is worrisome
   for malignancy), but didn't biopsy it given the bleeding risk.  She did
   take a nasal specimen for culture.  She recommended outpatient ENT
   f/u.  Neuro is not convniced that the patient had a stroke - they think

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: 76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to
   OSH w/ PNA and [**Hospital 3388**] transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI s/p BMS x2 to
   mid-LAD 90% stenosis now with ? of stroke/TIA, a sinus mass, and
   aspergillus in his sputum.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was restarted on a heparing gtt for a left ventricle
   thrombus and coumadin for long-term anticoagulation.  His foley,
   A-line, and central lines were removed.  He was only 300 cc neg at 4pm,
   so he was given 40 mg IV lasix for a goal neg of 1 L.   His prednisone
   was stopped given concern for aspergillosis as aspergillus grew in his
   sputum.  Levofloxacin was stopped as the team does not think he has
   PNA.  ID was consulted due to concern that the mass in his left
   maxillary sinus could be an invasive fungal infection and they
   recommended obtaining an induced sputum and a noncontrast chest CT to
   evaluate for evidence of PNA or aspergillosis.  They also wanted to
   send BCx, Fungal blood Cx, B-glucan, and Galactomman.  As they don't
   think aspergillosis is likely (it may have been a contaminant) they
   want to hold off on treatment for now.  ID recommended consulting ENT
   -  ENT saw the patient and felt that the mass on CT didn't have the
   typical appearance of an aspergillus fungal ball.  She looked in his
   nose and thought it looked like a soft tissue mass (which is worrisome
   for malignancy), but didn't biopsy it given the bleeding risk.  She did
   take a nasal specimen for culture.  She recommended outpatient ENT
   f/u.  Neuro is not convniced that the patient had a stroke - they think
   TIA vs possible old prior infarct which is showing through secondary to
   encephalopathy.  PT/OT were consulted.  His lantus was increased to 15
   units daily for better blood sugar control.
   This am the patient denies chest pain, SOB, or other complaints except
   for coughing.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia who presented to the emergency department with pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and diagnosed with a STEMI, which was treated with two balloon angioplasties to the mid-LAD 90% stenosis. The patient has developed a left-sided hemiparesis with facial droop and upgoing toes, which is consistent with a possible CVA. He also has a sinus mass and Aspergillus in his sputum, which is concerning for invasive aspergillosis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, and he is being treated with insulin and metformin. His creatinine level has improved from 1.5 to 1.0, but he is still experiencing acute renal failure. He has also developed a left ventricular thrombus, which is being treated with heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Invasive Aspergillosis: The patient's sinus mass and Aspergillus in his sputum are concerning for invasive aspergillosis, which can carry up to 50% mortality in ICU patients. Further workup and treatment are needed to determine the best course of action.
2. CVA: The patient's left-sided hemiparesis with facial droop and upgoing toes is consistent with a possible CVA. Further imaging studies, such as an MRI, are needed to confirm the diagnosis.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has improved, but he is still experiencing acute renal failure. Monitoring for autodiuresis and avoiding nephrotoxins are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
4. Left Ventricular Thrombus: The patient's left ventricular thrombus is being treated with heparin, but further monitoring is needed to ensure that the clot is not growing or causing any complications.
5. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and he is at risk for developing diabetic ketoacidosis. Close monitoring of his blood glucose levels and treatment with insulin and metformin are necessary to prevent this complication.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's STEMI and left ventricular thrombus put him at risk for cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias. Close monitoring of his cardiovascular status and treatment with medications as needed are necessary to prevent these complications.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's pneumonia and acute respiratory failure put him at risk for respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure and pneumonia. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and treatment with antibiotics and oxygen as needed are necessary to prevent these complications."

   Chief Complaint: 76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to
   OSH w/ PNA and [**Hospital 3388**] transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI s/p BMS x2 to
   mid-LAD 90% stenosis now with ? of stroke/TIA, a sinus mass, and
   aspergillus in his sputum.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was restarted on a heparing gtt for a left ventricle
   thrombus and coumadin for long-term anticoagulation.  His foley,
   A-line, and central lines were removed.  He was only 300 cc neg at 4pm,
   so he was given 40 mg IV lasix for a goal neg of 1 L.   His prednisone
   was stopped given concern for aspergillosis as aspergillus grew in his
   sputum.  Levofloxacin was stopped as the team does not think he has
   PNA.  ID was consulted due to concern that the mass in his left
   maxillary sinus could be an invasive fungal infection and they
   recommended obtaining an induced sputum and a noncontrast chest CT to
   evaluate for evidence of PNA or aspergillosis.  They also wanted to
   send BCx, Fungal blood Cx, B-glucan, and Galactomman.  As they don't
   think aspergillosis is likely (it may have been a contaminant) they
   want to hold off on treatment for now.  ID recommended consulting ENT
   -  ENT saw the patient and felt that the mass on CT didn't have the
   typical appearance of an aspergillus fungal ball.  She looked in his
   nose and thought it looked like a soft tissue mass (which is worrisome
   for malignancy), but didn't biopsy it given the bleeding risk.  She did
   take a nasal specimen for culture.  She recommended outpatient ENT
   f/u.  Neuro is not convniced that the patient had a stroke - they think
   TIA vs possible old prior infarct which is showing through secondary to
   encephalopathy.  PT/OT were consulted.  His lantus was increased to 15
   units daily for better blood sugar control.
   This am the patient denies chest pain, SOB, or other complaints except
   for coughing.

   #. COPD exacerbation/CAP
 Pt. w/ wheezes and rhonchi on exam
   consistent w/ COPD exacerbation.  Now w/ stable oxygen requirement (on
   2L).
   - Will start spirivia daily; continue Xopenex standing Q6h and
   Ipratropium q6h.
   - Continue levofloxacin for 3 more days for CAP (pt. had received 4d
   already)
   # Aspergillus in the sputum
Patient found to have aspergillus in his
   sputum, pt. also w/ sinus disease w. dehissence of medial sinus wall.
   Given DM and recent steroid course at OSH, pt has been immunosuppressed
   recently.  Possibly invasive aspergillosis.  ID and ENT were consulted
   yesterday.  ENT did not feel that the mass on imaging was consistent
   with a fungus ball and ID thought the aspergillus in his sputum may
   have been contamination.
   -  Appreciate ENT and ID consults.  Will f/u recs.
   -  F/u BCx, fungal BCx, Sinus aspiration Smear/Cx, B-glucan, and
   galactomannan.
   -  Chest CT without contrast recommended by ID to evaluate his lungs
   for evidence of aspergillus
 patient will get today, will f/u results.
   -  Patient will have an induced sputum sent today.
   # Left maxillary mass
 Patient with left maxillary opacificiation and
   dehissene of the medical sinus wall.  Per ENT this is likely a soft
   tissue mass, concerning for malignancy, but unlikely to be infection.
   -  Appreciate ENT consult.
   -  Patient will need an outpatient workup and likely biopsy of the
   mass.
   # Left hemiparesis w/ facial droop
  The patient
s neuro findings are
   now resolved.  Neuro felt that this was not consistent with an acute
   stroke, but more likely a TIA or pervious neurologic injury manifesting
   itself as the patient recovers from his acute event.
   - Appreciate Neuro consult, will f/u recs
   #. CAD - Pt w/ STEMI, now s/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90% stenosis. Anatomy
   also w/ proximally occluded RCA w/ robust collaterals.  CKs peaked on
   [**12-29**] at 714, now 644.  Asymptomatic.  Held heparin gtt yesterday given
   concern for ICH.
   - Continue daily [**Last Name (LF) 119**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] decrease to 81mg and Plavix
   - Switch Captopril to lisinopril 10 mg daily.
   - Continue high-dose statin, switch Metoprolol to Toprol XL 50 mg
   daily.
   - Insulin as below for tight blood sugar control
   - DC heparin gtt as his INR is therapeutic.
   #  Heart function: No evidence of heart failure.  Elevated BPs o/n.
   Mildly overloaded on exam, crackles.  ECHO w/ LVEF > 55%, symmetric LVH
   suggestive of diastolic dysfunction, w/ PAH.
   - Will hold off additional diuresis.
   - Pt. on ACE and B-blocker as above.
   #. Acute renal failure
 Resolving. Creatinine on arrival to OSH was
   elevated to 1.5.  Improved to 1.1 now.
   - Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins.
   #. Diabetes - On PO Metformin at home, was on insulin gtt at OSH ICU.
   - Holding home Metformin
   - Continue increased dosing of Lantus at 15 units with Reg. SSI
   coverage for BG < 150.
   - Monitor FS and consider further increase of Lantus t/m if elevated
   consistently above 150.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a complex medical history, including hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the emergency department with pneumonia and acute renal failure. He was found to have a STEMI and underwent two balloon angioplasty procedures to the mid-LAD 90% stenosis. He was transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient has developed a left maxillary sinus mass, which is concerning for malignancy, and has aspergillus in his sputum, which may be a contaminant or indicative of invasive aspergillosis. He has also had a left hemiparesis with facial droop, which has resolved, and is being evaluated for potential stroke or TIA.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Invasive aspergillosis: The patient's aspergillus in his sputum may be a contaminant or indicative of invasive aspergillosis, which can be life-threatening if left untreated.
2. Malignancy: The patient's left maxillary sinus mass is concerning for malignancy, which could be a significant complication if not treated promptly.
3. Stroke or TIA: The patient's left hemiparesis with facial droop may be indicative of a stroke or TIA, which could be a life-threatening complication if not treated promptly.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's STEMI and subsequent balloon angioplasty procedures may have caused cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias, which could be life-threatening.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may be a complication of his pneumonia or other underlying medical conditions, which could worsen if not managed promptly.
6. Diabetes complications: The patient's diabetes may be complicated by hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, which could be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
7. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and sinusitis may be complicated by secondary infections, such as sepsis or meningitis, which could be life-threatening if not treated promptly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's aspergillus in his sputum and consider further evaluation and treatment if necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's left maxillary sinus mass and consider further evaluation and treatment if necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's left hemiparesis with facial droop and consider further evaluation and treatment if necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider further evaluation and treatment if necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's acute renal failure and consider further evaluation and treatment if necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's diabetes and consider further evaluation and treatment if necessary.
7. Consider further evaluation and treatment for potential infections, such as sepsis or meningitis."

   Chief Complaint: 76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to
   OSH w/ PNA and [**Hospital 3388**] transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI s/p BMS x2 to
   mid-LAD 90% stenosis now with ? of stroke/TIA, a sinus mass, and
   aspergillus in his sputum.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was restarted on a heparing gtt for a left ventricle
   thrombus and coumadin for long-term anticoagulation.  His foley,
   A-line, and central lines were removed.  He was only 300 cc neg at 4pm,
   so he was given 40 mg IV lasix for a goal neg of 1 L.   His prednisone
   was stopped given concern for aspergillosis as aspergillus grew in his
   sputum.  Levofloxacin was stopped as the team does not think he has
   PNA.  ID was consulted due to concern that the mass in his left
   maxillary sinus could be an invasive fungal infection and they
   recommended obtaining an induced sputum and a noncontrast chest CT to
   evaluate for evidence of PNA or aspergillosis.  They also wanted to
   send BCx, Fungal blood Cx, B-glucan, and Galactomman.  As they don't
   think aspergillosis is likely (it may have been a contaminant) they
   want to hold off on treatment for now.  ID recommended consulting ENT
   -  ENT saw the patient and felt that the mass on CT didn't have the
   typical appearance of an aspergillus fungal ball.  She looked in his
   nose and thought it looked like a soft tissue mass (which is worrisome
   for malignancy), but didn't biopsy it given the bleeding risk.  She did
   take a nasal specimen for culture.  She recommended outpatient ENT
   f/u.  Neuro is not convniced that the patient had a stroke - they think
   TIA vs possible old prior infarct which is showing through secondary to
   encephalopathy.  PT/OT were consulted.  His lantus was increased to 15
   units daily for better blood sugar control.
   This am the patient denies chest pain, SOB, or other complaints except
   for coughing.

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: 76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to
   OSH w/ PNA and [**Hospital 3388**] transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI s/p BMS x2 to
   mid-LAD 90% stenosis now with ? of stroke/TIA, a sinus mass, and
   aspergillus in his sputum.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was restarted on a heparing gtt for a left ventricle
   thrombus and coumadin for long-term anticoagulation.  His foley,
   A-line, and central lines were removed.  He was only 300 cc neg at 4pm,
   so he was given 40 mg IV lasix for a goal neg of 1 L.   His prednisone
   was stopped given concern for aspergillosis as aspergillus grew in his
   sputum.  Levofloxacin was stopped as the team does not think he has
   PNA.  ID was consulted due to concern that the mass in his left
   maxillary sinus could be an invasive fungal infection and they
   recommended obtaining an induced sputum and a noncontrast chest CT to
   evaluate for evidence of PNA or aspergillosis.  They also wanted to
   send BCx, Fungal blood Cx, B-glucan, and Galactomman.  As they don't
   think aspergillosis is likely (it may have been a contaminant) they
   want to hold off on treatment for now.  ID recommended consulting ENT
   -  ENT saw the patient and felt that the mass on CT didn't have the
   typical appearance of an aspergillus fungal ball.  She looked in his
   nose and thought it looked like a soft tissue mass (which is worrisome
   for malignancy), but didn't biopsy it given the bleeding risk.  She did
   take a nasal specimen for culture.  She recommended outpatient ENT
   f/u.  Neuro is not convniced that the patient had a stroke - they think
   TIA vs possible old prior infarct which is showing through secondary to
   encephalopathy.  PT/OT were consulted.  His lantus was increased to 15
   units daily for better blood sugar control.
   This am the patient denies chest pain, SOB, or other complaints except
   for coughing.

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to OSH w/ PNA and
   ARF, now transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI. S/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90%
   stenosis, now extubated w/ resolved leftsided hemiparesis.
   #. COPD exacerbation/CAP
 Pt. w/ wheezes and rhonchi on exam
   consistent w/ COPD exacerbation.  Now w/ stable oxygen requirement (on
   2L).
   - Will start spirivia daily; continue Xopenex standing Q6h and
   Ipratropium q6h.
   - Continue levofloxacin for 3 more days for CAP (pt. had received 4d
   already)
   # Aspergillus in the sputum
Patient found to have aspergillus in his
   sputum, pt. also w/ sinus disease w. dehissence of medial sinus wall.
   Given DM and recent steroid course at OSH, pt has been immunosuppressed
   recently.  Possibly invasive aspergillosis.  ID and ENT were consulted
   yesterday.  ENT did not feel that the mass on imaging was consistent
   with a fungus ball and ID thought the aspergillus in his sputum may
   have been contamination.
   -  Appreciate ENT and ID consults.  Will f/u recs.
   -  F/u BCx, fungal BCx, Sinus aspiration Smear/Cx, B-glucan, and
   galactomannan.
   -  Chest CT without contrast recommended by ID to evaluate his lungs
   for evidence of aspergillus
 patient will get today, will f/u results.
   -  Patient will have an induced sputum sent today.
   # Left maxillary mass
 Patient with left maxillary opacificiation and
   dehissene of the medical sinus wall.  Per ENT this is likely a soft
   tissue mass, concerning for malignancy, but unlikely to be infection.
   -  Appreciate ENT consult.
   -  Patient will need an outpatient workup and likely biopsy of the
   mass.
   # Left hemiparesis w/ facial droop
  The patient
s neuro findings are
   now resolved.  Neuro felt that this was not consistent with an acute
   stroke, but more likely a TIA or pervious neurologic injury manifesting
   itself as the patient recovers from his acute event.
   - Appreciate Neuro consult, will f/u recs
   #. CAD - Pt w/ STEMI, now s/p BMS x2 to mid-LAD 90% stenosis. Anatomy
   also w/ proximally occluded RCA w/ robust collaterals.  CKs peaked on
   [**12-29**] at 714, now 644.  Asymptomatic.  Held heparin gtt yesterday given
   concern for ICH.
   - Continue daily [**Last Name (LF) 119**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] decrease to 81mg and Plavix
   - Switch Captopril to lisinopril 10 mg daily.
   - Continue high-dose statin, switch Metoprolol to Toprol XL 50 mg
   daily.
   - Insulin as below for tight blood sugar control
   - DC heparin gtt as his INR is therapeutic.
   #  Heart function: No evidence of heart failure.  ECHO w/ LVEF > 55%,
   symmetric LVH suggestive of diastolic dysfunction, w/ PAH.  No edema on
   exam.
   - Will hold off additional diuresis.
   - Pt. on ACE and B-blocker as above.
   #. Acute renal failure
 Resolving. Creatinine on arrival to OSH was
   elevated to 1.5.  Improved to 1.1 now.
   - Continue to trend Cr and avoid nephrotoxins.
   #. Diabetes - On PO Metformin at home, was on insulin gtt at OSH ICU.
   - Holding home Metformin
   - Continue increased dosing of Lantus at 15 units with Reg. SSI
   coverage for BG < 150.
   - Monitor FS and consider further increase of Lantus t/m if elevated
   consistently above 150.
   #. Depression - Continue home Celexa.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the emergency department with pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and was found to have a STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) with a 90% stenosis in the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) artery. He underwent two balloon angioplasty procedures and was started on heparin and coumadin for anticoagulation. He was also found to have a left maxillary mass, which was concerning for malignancy, and aspergillus in his sputum, which may be a contaminant.

The patient's condition has been stable, with no evidence of heart failure or respiratory distress. His creatinine levels have improved from 1.5 to 1.1, and he is no longer requiring dialysis. His blood sugar levels are being monitored and controlled with insulin and metformin.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications, including:

* Aspergillosis: The patient has aspergillus in his sputum, which may be a contaminant or a sign of invasive aspergillosis.
* Malignancy: The patient has a left maxillary mass, which is concerning for malignancy.
* Cardiovascular disease: The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and STEMI, which puts him at risk for further cardiovascular events.
* Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has required mechanical ventilation in the past.
* Neurological complications: The patient has had a stroke or TIA, which may have caused his left hemiparesis and facial droop.
* Infection: The patient has a Foley catheter and central lines, which puts him at risk for infection.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Aspergillosis: The patient may develop invasive aspergillosis, which can be fatal if left untreated.
* Malignancy: The patient may develop further malignancies, such as lung cancer, given his history of smoking and COPD.
* Cardiovascular disease: The patient may develop further cardiovascular events, such as heart failure or arrhythmias, given his history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and STEMI.
* Respiratory failure: The patient may develop further respiratory failure, given his history of COPD and mechanical ventilation.
* Neurological complications: The patient may develop further neurological complications, such as stroke or TIA, given his history of left hemiparesis and facial droop.
* Infection: The patient may develop further infections, such as sepsis or pneumonia, given his history of Foley catheter and central lines."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: 76M with HTN, DM, HL, but no known CAD, presented to
   OSH w/ PNA and [**Hospital 3388**] transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] CCU w/ STEMI s/p BMS x2 to
   mid-LAD 90% stenosis now with ? of stroke/TIA, a sinus mass, and
   aspergillus in his sputum.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was restarted on a heparing gtt for a left ventricle
   thrombus and coumadin for long-term anticoagulation.  His foley,
   A-line, and central lines were removed.  He was only 300 cc neg at 4pm,
   so he was given 40 mg IV lasix for a goal neg of 1 L.   His prednisone
   was stopped given concern for aspergillosis as aspergillus grew in his
   sputum.  Levofloxacin was stopped as the team does not think he has
   PNA.  ID was consulted due to concern that the mass in his left
   maxillary sinus could be an invasive fungal infection and they
   recommended obtaining an induced sputum and a noncontrast chest CT to
   evaluate for evidence of PNA or aspergillosis.  They also wanted to
   send BCx, Fungal blood Cx, B-glucan, and Galactomman.  As they don't
   think aspergillosis is likely (it may have been a contaminant) they
   want to hold off on treatment for now).  ID recommended consulting ENT
   -  ENT saw the patient and felt that the mass on CT didn't have the
   typical appearance of an aspergillus fungal ball.  She looked in his
   nose and thought it looked like a soft tissue mass (which is worrisome
   for malignancy), but didn't biopsy it given the bleeding risk.  She did
   take a nasal specimen for culture.  She recommended outpatient ENT
   f/u.  Neuro is not convniced that the patient had a stroke - they think
   TIA vs possible old prior infarct which is showing through secondary to
   encephalopathy.  PT/OT were consulted.  His lantus was increased to 15
   units daily for better blood sugar control.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the emergency department with pneumonia and acute kidney injury (ARF). He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with two bare-metal stents to the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) artery. He also has a left-sided hemiparesis, which is thought to be due to a possible stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: He has coarse breath sounds, wheezing, and rhonchi bilaterally, consistent with a COPD exacerbation.
* Cardiovascular: He has a left-sided hemiparesis, facial droop, and upgoing toes, which is consistent with a possible CVA.
* Neurological: He has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15, with no signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP).
* Hemodynamic: His blood pressure is elevated, and he is mildly overloaded on examination.
* Renal: His creatinine level is elevated, and he has acute kidney injury (AKI).
* Endocrine: He has diabetes mellitus and is receiving insulin and metformin.

The patient's medications include:

* Heparin sodium infusion
* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Furosemide (Lasix)
* Lantus
* Insulin
* Metformin
* Aspirin
* Plavix
* Captopril
* Lopressor
* Statin

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 9.4-9.7 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 10.5-11.5 g/dL
* Platelet count (PLT): 179-177 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.1-1.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 28-30 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Na+: 140-142 mmol/L, K+: 3.7-4.1 mmol/L, Cl-: 101-103 mmol/L
* Glucose: 128-143 mg/dL

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Aspergillus infection, which can cause invasive aspergillosis, a life-threatening condition.
* CVA or TIA, which can lead to stroke or brain damage.
* Acute kidney injury (AKI), which can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD).
* Respiratory failure, which can occur due to COPD exacerbation or pneumonia.
* Cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias, which can occur due to STEMI or PCI.

Based on the patient's condition, the following interventions are recommended:

* Continue to monitor his respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as needed.
* Continue to manage his cardiovascular status, including blood pressure control and anticoagulation therapy.
* Continue to monitor his renal function and adjust diuretic therapy as needed.
* Continue to manage his glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
* Continue to monitor his neurological status and adjust anticoagulation therapy as needed.
* Consider imaging studies, such as a CT or MRI, to further evaluate his neurological status.
* Consider antifungal therapy for the treatment of aspergillosis."
