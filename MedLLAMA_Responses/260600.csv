You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for severe left main (LM) disease. She presented to the ICU today for cardiac issues and is being transferred to the CCU due to concerns about post-catheterization bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 92/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Her physical examination is notable for a moderately large hematoma in the right groin with extension into the lower pelvis and to the midline, but her hemodynamics are stable, and her hematocrit (Hct) is only down a few points.

The patient has several medical conditions, including CAD, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. She is taking multiple medications, including aspirin, statin, beta-blocker, and levothyroxine.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 5.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 10.3 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 224 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 105 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 12.4/23.9/1.0, Ca++: 8.0 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 3.7 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Monitoring for post-catheterization bleeding and hematoma expansion
* Rechecking Hct in 4 hours
* Holding transfusions for now
* Following up with a final read of the CT scan
* Performing serial exams
* Monitoring vitals
* Holding beta-blocker
* Placing a second peripheral intravenous (PIV) line

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Hemorrhage or hematoma expansion
* Cardiac tamponade
* Myocardial infarction (MI)
* Pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
* Respiratory failure
* Infection
* Hypothyroidism exacerbation

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of CAD, who underwent CABG for severe LM disease. She presented today with cardiac issues and is being transferred to the CCU due to concerns about post-cath bleeding. The patient has a large hematoma in the right groin with extension into the lower pelvis and midline, with minimal change. Her vital signs are stable, but her HCT is dropping to 29.5, indicating ongoing bleeding. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has a normal EF.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient's HCT is dropping, indicating ongoing bleeding, which can lead to hemorrhagic shock if not addressed promptly.
2. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's fluid balance is compromised, which can lead to hypovolemic shock if not managed properly.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential kidney damage, which can worsen with continued bleeding.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's ABG results indicate a moderate degree of respiratory acidosis, which can worsen with continued bleeding and hypovolemia.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiac history and ongoing bleeding can lead to cardiovascular complications such as cardiac tamponade or cardiogenic shock.
6. Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised due to the bleeding and surgical intervention, making her more susceptible to infection.
7. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk for pulmonary embolism due to the bleeding and immobility.
8. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential kidney damage, which can worsen with continued bleeding and hypovolemia.
9. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac history and ongoing bleeding can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
10. Sepsis: The patient's compromised immune system and ongoing bleeding make her more susceptible to sepsis."

   Chief Complaint:
   62F with a history of CAD, s/p CABG for severe LM disease who underwent
   a cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the CCU due to post-cath
   bleeding, found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, now s/p
   surgical removal.
   24 Hour Events:
   Plavix was stopped yesterday due to her bleeding risk. Patient had low
   SBPs in the 80's in the morning, was given 2 units PRBC and IVF and her
   pressures came up to the 100s.  Had Hct increase to 32 with2 units of
   blood.  Repeat abd CT/pelvis showed improvement of the size of the
   hematoma and no new suspicious areas to explain the patient's low BP.
   Vascular saw the patient and wanted a US to rule out aneurysm and the
   US showed a 2.2 cm pseudoaneurysm of the right common femoral artery
   near the site of the puncture.  There was also a thrombus seen in the
   right common femoral vein.  The patient was taken to surgery overnight
   where the psuedoaneurysm was removed and her hematoma was evacuated.
   She was started on a heparin gtt for the thrombus.  As her Hct
   decreased to 26 on recheck, she was given 1 unit PRBC overnight.
   This am she reports some burning at the site of surgery.  Denies chest
   pain, SOB, dizziness.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   62F with a history of CAD, s/p CABG for severe LM disease who underwent
   a cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the CCU due to post-cath
   bleeding, found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, now s/p
   surgical removal.
   24 Hour Events:
   Plavix was stopped yesterday due to her bleeding risk. Patient had low
   SBPs in the 80's in the morning, was given 2 units PRBC and IVF and her
   pressures came up to the 100s.  Had Hct increase to 32 with2 units of
   blood.  Repeat abd CT/pelvis showed improvement of the size of the
   hematoma and no new suspicious areas to explain the patient's low BP.
   Vascular saw the patient and wanted a US to rule out aneurysm and the
   US showed a 2.2 cm pseudoaneurysm of the right common femoral artery
   near the site of the puncture.  There was also a thrombus seen in the
   right common femoral vein.  The patient was taken to surgery overnight
   where the psuedoaneurysm was removed and her hematoma was evacuated.
   She was started on a heparin gtt for the thrombus.  As her Hct
   decreased to 26 on recheck, she was given 1 unit PRBC overnight.
   This am she reports some burning at the site of surgery.  Denies chest
   pain, SOB, dizziness.

   # HEMATOMA:  CT showed moderately large hematoma with no RPB.  Pt. w/
   dropping SBPs into 80s w/ HCT down to 29.5.  Likely continuing to bleed
   given dropping HCT and increasing abdominal pain on exam, although no
   visible extension of hematoma.
   - IVF bolus 500cc, then 1L at 100cc/hr now
   - Will hold Plavix as no stent in PCI
   - Will give one unit of RBCs, recheck HCT and give another unit
   thereafter.
   - HCT Q6H
   - Repeat CT STAT to assess for change in hematoma size.
   - Serial exams
   - Call Vascular surgery to assess for possible open intervention.
   - Monitor vitals
   - Holding b-blocker
   # CORONARIES:  Known 3VD with prior CABG.  After ETT showed apical
   ischemia and a hypokinetic septum, performed for progressive dyspnea,
   underwent cardiac cath today which showed patent grafts and had a POBA
   to the distal LAD.
   - Continue aspirin and statin
   - Will hold beta-blocker until her Hct have stabilized.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of CAD, who underwent CABG for severe LM disease and subsequently developed a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery. She was admitted to the CCU due to post-cath bleeding and underwent surgical removal of the pseudoaneurysm.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 98/50 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. She is receiving IVF at 100cc/hr and has received two units of PRBCs. Her hematocrit has increased to 32%, and her blood products have been discontinued.

The patient reports some burning at the site of surgery, but denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness. Her physical examination is notable for a well-healed sternal wound and a tender groin with a blood-soaked bandage.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.7 K/uL, a platelet count of 224 K/uL, and a creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL. Her INR is 1.2, and her PT is 13.8 seconds.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Continuing IVF at 100cc/hr
* Holding Plavix due to no stent in PCI
* Giving one unit of RBCs and rechecking HCT
* Repeating CT scan to assess for change in hematoma size
* Serial exams and monitoring vitals
* Holding beta-blocker until HCT have stabilized
* Continuing aspirin and statin
* Holding DVT prophylaxis with pneumatic boots
* Managing pain with tylenol PRN
* Providing bowel regimen

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued bleeding from the pseudoaneurysm site
* Development of a thrombus in the right common femoral vein
* Increased risk of DVT due to the patient's history of CAD and recent surgery
* Hypothyroidism due to the patient's history of hypothyroidism and the use of levothyroxine
* Infection at the site of surgery
* Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure due to the patient's history of CAD and recent cardiac catheterization."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   62F with a history of CAD, s/p CABG for severe LM disease who underwent
   a cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the CCU due to post-cath
   bleeding, found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, now s/p
   surgical removal.
   24 Hour Events:
   Plavix was stopped yesterday due to her bleeding risk. Patient had low
   SBPs in the 80's in the morning, was given 2 units PRBC and IVF and her
   pressures came up to the 100s.  Had Hct increase to 32 with2 units of
   blood.  Repeat abd CT/pelvis showed improvement of the size of the
   hematoma and no new suspicious areas to explain the patient's low BP.
   Vascular saw the patient and wanted a US to rule out aneurysm and the
   US showed a 2.2 cm pseudoaneurysm of the right common femoral artery
   near the site of the puncture.  There was also a thrombus seen in the
   right common femoral vein.  The patient was taken to surgery overnight
   where the psuedoaneurysm was removed and her hematoma was evacuated.
   She was started on a heparin gtt for the thrombus.  As her Hct
   decreased to 26 on recheck, she was given 1 unit PRBC overnight.
   This am she reports some burning at the site of surgery.  Denies chest
   pain, SOB, dizziness.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for severe left main disease. She developed a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery after a cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to post-catheterization bleeding. She underwent surgical removal of the pseudoaneurysm and evacuation of the hematoma. The patient is currently receiving heparin therapy for a thrombus in the right common femoral vein.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's bleeding risk is increased due to her pseudoaneurysm and the use of anticoagulant therapy. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values is necessary to detect any signs of bleeding.
2. Thromboembolic complications: The patient's thrombus in the right common femoral vein may lead to embolization to other parts of the body, such as the lungs or brain. Anticoagulant therapy and close monitoring are necessary to prevent this complication.
3. Infection: The patient's surgical site may be at risk for infection, particularly with the use of anticoagulant therapy. Close monitoring of the wound and laboratory values is necessary to detect any signs of infection.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CAD and recent cardiac catheterization may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias. Close monitoring of her cardiac status and laboratory values is necessary to detect any signs of cardiovascular complications.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status may be at risk due to her recent surgery and the use of anticoagulant therapy. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and laboratory values is necessary to detect any signs of respiratory complications.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's recent surgery and the use of anticoagulant therapy may increase her risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures. Close monitoring of her neurological status and laboratory values is necessary to detect any signs of neurological complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with a history of CAD, s/p CABG for severe LM disease who presented
   today for cardiac, now being transferred to the CCU given worry for
   post-cath bleeding.
   .
   # HEMATOMA:  CT showed moderately large hematoma with no RPB.  Pt. w/
   dropping SBPs into 80s w/ HCT down to 29.5.  Likely continuing to bleed
   given dropping HCT and increasing abdominal pain on exam, although no
   visible extension of hematoma.
   - IVF bolus 500cc, then 1L at 100cc/hr now
   - Will hold Plavix as no stent in PCI
   - Will give one unit of RBCs, recheck HCT and give another unit
   thereafter.
   - HCT Q6H
   - Repeat CT STAT to assess for change in hematoma size.
   - Serial exams
   - Call Vascular surgery to assess for possible open intervention.
   - Monitor vitals
   - Holding b-blocker
   # CORONARIES:  Known 3VD with prior CABG.  After ETT showed apical
   ischemia and a hypokinetic septum, performed for progressive dyspnea,
   underwent cardiac cath today which showed patent grafts with no
   interventions performed.
   - Continue with aspirin, statin
   - Will hold beta-blocker
   # PUMP:  EF of 60% on MIBI done last month.  Not currently in failure.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for severe left main disease. She presented to the hospital today with concern for post-catheterization bleeding and is being transferred to the CCU. The patient has a large hematoma in the right groin area, which is causing low blood pressure and abdominal pain. She is receiving IV fluids and blood products to manage her bleeding and is being monitored closely for any changes in her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's hematoma is large and may continue to bleed, which could lead to further complications such as hypovolemic shock or cardiac arrest.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and recent CABG surgery make her susceptible to cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction.
3. Infection: The patient's presence of a large hematoma and recent surgical procedure make her at risk for infection, which could lead to sepsis or organ failure.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's recent surgery and presence of a hematoma may lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's low blood pressure and potential for continued bleeding may lead to neurological complications such as stroke or seizures.
6. Renal complications: The patient's history of CAD and recent surgery may lead to renal complications such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
7. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient's low blood pressure and potential for continued bleeding may lead to hemorrhagic shock, which could be life-threatening.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient's bleeding and potential for continued bleeding may lead to coagulopathy, which could worsen her bleeding and increase her risk of complications.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. IV fluids and blood products to manage her bleeding
2. Repeat CT scans to assess for changes in the size of the hematoma
3. Serial exams to monitor her vital signs and assess for any changes in her condition
4. Holding beta-blockers and aspirin to reduce the risk of bleeding
5. Monitoring her cardiac rhythm and function
6. Managing her pain with medication
7. Providing prophylaxis for DVT and VAP
8. Monitoring her glycemic control and nutrition

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to the CCU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and severe left main disease, who underwent cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the CCU due to post-cath bleeding. She was found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery and underwent surgical removal.

Currently, the patient is in the ICU after undergoing vascular repair of the pseudoaneurysm. She has continued oozing from the operative site with stable hemoglobin concentrations (HCTs) and supratherapeutic international normalized ratios (INRs). She is receiving 750 units per hour of heparin and is being transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 96 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 109/51 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 93% on room air.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-healed sternal wound, but she has a tender groin area with a bandage over the operative site. Her abdominal examination is significant for a firm abdomen with tenderness in the lower quadrants.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.7, hemoglobin of 21.5%, and platelet count of 70,000. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 11 mg/dL, creatinine is 0.6 mg/dL, and glucose is 121 mg/dL. Her international normalized ratio (INR) is 1.1, and her partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is 58.2 seconds.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Continue heparin gtt for thrombus in the common right femoral vein
* CT of pelvis and thigh to assess for retroperitoneal bleed
* No Plavix due to no stent
* Transfuse 2 units of packed red blood cells now and monitor with serial HCTs
* Active T&S and 2 large bore IVs
* Hold beta-blocker until HCT is stable
* Continue aspirin and statin
* Continue levothyroxine for hypothyroidism
* Cardiac diet
* PIV's for access
* DVT prophylaxis with pneumatic boots
* Pain management with tylenol PRN
* Bowel regimen
* DNR/DNI code, discussed with patient at time of transfer
* CCU disposition

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Retroperitoneal bleed
* Hemorrhagic shock
* Coagulopathy
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
* Pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Cardiac tamponade
* Hypovolemic shock
* Sepsis
* Organ failure (e.g., renal, hepatic, or respiratory)"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), who underwent cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to post-catheterization bleeding. She had a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, which was surgically removed.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a hematocrit (HCT) of 30.1 after receiving a total of 6 units of blood products. She has a right femoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed. She is off heparin and is at risk for IVC thrombosis, but is not currently anticoagulated due to ongoing bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/58 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 94% on room air.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a large hematoma in the right groin area, which appears to be unchanged from yesterday. Her extremities are warm and pulses are intact distally.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.1 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 162 x 10^9/L. Her electrolyte levels are normal, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.2 mmol/L.

The patient's plan is to continue to monitor her HCT and to consider restarting anticoagulation once her bleeding has stopped. She will also continue to receive pain management with tylenol as needed and will be started on a bowel regimen.

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient is at risk for ongoing bleeding due to her IVC filter and the presence of a hematoma in her right groin area.
2. IVC thrombosis: The patient is at risk for IVC thrombosis due to her IVC filter and the presence of a DVT in her right femoral vein.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk for pulmonary embolism due to her DVT and the presence of an IVC filter.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her surgical incision and the presence of a hematoma in her right groin area.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and has undergone cardiac catheterization and surgery, which may put her at risk for cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she is at risk for several potential medical complications that will need to be closely monitored and managed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of CAD, s/p CABG for severe LM disease, who underwent cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the CCU due to post-cath bleeding. She developed a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, which was surgically removed. The patient has been experiencing bleeding and hematoma formation in the retroperitoneum and thigh, with a right femoral DVT diagnosed. She has received a total of 6 units of blood and has had an IVC filter placed. The patient's HCT has stabilized at 30, and she is currently off heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. IVC Thrombosis: The patient has an IVC filter in place, which increases her risk of IVC thrombosis. However, given the uncertainty of whether the bleeding has definitively stopped, the patient is not currently anticoagulated.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Progression: The patient has a right femoral DVT, and there is a risk of progression to more proximal DVT or pulmonary embolism.
3. Hematoma Expansion: The patient's hematoma has not changed significantly, but there is still a risk of expansion, which could lead to further bleeding and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Infection: The patient has a surgical incision site and is at risk of developing an infection.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of CAD and has undergone CABG, and there is a risk of cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient has a history of respiratory issues, and there is a risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient has a history of CAD and has undergone CABG, and there is a risk of neurological complications such as stroke or transient ischemic attack.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's HCT regularly to ensure stability and prevent further bleeding.
2. Consider anticoagulation therapy once the patient's bleeding has stabilized and the risk of IVC thrombosis is assessed.
3. Monitor the patient's DVT and consider anticoagulation therapy if necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's hematoma and surgical incision site for signs of infection or expansion.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular and respiratory status, and consider additional interventions as necessary.
6. Consider restarting beta-blocker therapy once the patient's HCT is stable and SBP is > 100mmHg.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and consider additional interventions as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), who underwent cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the CCU due to post-cath bleeding. She was found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, which was surgically removed. The patient has been experiencing bleeding from the groin site, which has led to a drop in her hemoglobin (HCT) level. She has also developed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right femoral vein.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* Heart rate: 76 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 113/58 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Hemoglobin: 30.1%
* Platelet count: 162 x 10^9/L

The patient has been receiving heparin drips, and her bleeding has been controlled. She has also been started on warfarin to prevent further thrombosis. The patient's cardiac status is stable, and she is in sinus rhythm.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hemorrhage: The patient is at risk for further bleeding from the groin site, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has developed a DVT in the right femoral vein, which could lead to pulmonary embolism and death if left untreated.
3. Pseudoaneurysm: The patient's pseudoaneurysm is at risk for rupture, which could lead to significant bleeding and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Infection: The patient's surgical site is at risk for infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but she is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and heart failure.

Plan:

1. Continue heparin drips to control bleeding and prevent further thrombosis.
2. Monitor the patient's HCT level and platelet count to ensure that they are within a safe range.
3. Perform regular ultrasound examinations to monitor the pseudoaneurysm and DVT.
4. Continue warfarin therapy to prevent further thrombosis.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust her medication regimen as necessary.
6. Provide pain management and bowel regimen to prevent complications.
7. Consider consulting with a vascular surgeon to assess the patient's bleeding and pseudoaneurysm.
8. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medication regimen as necessary.
9. Consider consulting with a cardiologist to assess the patient's cardiac status and adjust her medication regimen as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, who underwent cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the ICU due to post-catheterization bleeding. She has undergone surgical removal of a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery and has been stabilized with 6 units of packed red blood cells.

Current vital signs:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 77 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 118/48 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: stable

The patient is ambulating and eating well, with no complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, or bleeding. However, she has tenderness at the right groin site.

Physical examination:

* General: middle-aged female in no acute distress, oriented x3, with a mood and affect appropriate for her age.
* Cardiovascular: regular rhythm, no murmurs or gallop.
* Pulmonary: patient was breathing comfortably, with clear lung fields.
* Abdomen: soft in the upper abdomen, but diffusely tender to palpation, with firmness present in the lower abdomen, including the right groin and lower pelvis, and the left lower quadrant.
* Extremities: no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema; no femoral bruits; right thigh significantly swollen, but unchanged from yesterday, with ecchymotic skin examination.

Lab results:

* Hemoglobin: 11.1 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 30.8%
* Platelet count: 179,000/μL
* White blood cell count: 5.6 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 114 mg/dL
* Other lab results: PT/PTT/INR: 13.1/58.2/1.1, differential neutrophils: 81.0%, lymphocytes: 14.7%, monocytes: 2.3%, eosinophils: 1.9%, albumin: 3.3 g/dL, calcium: 7.2 mg/dL, magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL, phosphorus: 1.7 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient has a history of post-catheterization bleeding and has undergone surgical removal of a pseudoaneurysm. There is a risk of further bleeding, especially with the presence of an IVC filter.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a right femoral DVT and is at risk for IVC thrombosis due to the IVC filter.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of DVT and is at risk for pulmonary embolism.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone cardiac catheterization. There is a risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Infection: The patient has undergone surgical removal of a pseudoaneurysm and has an IVC filter in place, which increases the risk of infection.

Assessment and plan:

1. Continue aspirin and statin therapy.
2. Increase Metoprolol to 25 mg PO BID.
3. Continue heparin-free anticoagulation and monitor for signs of bleeding or DVT.
4. Continue ambulation and encourage early mobilization.
5. Monitor for signs of cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
6. Monitor for signs of infection, such as fever, chills, or increased white blood cell count.
7. Consider anticoagulation therapy in the post-ICU setting, depending on the patient's clinical status and the presence of the IVC filter."

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with a history of CAD, s/p CABG for severe LM disease who underwent
   a cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the CCU due to post-cath
   bleeding, found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, now s/p
   surgical removal.  HC stabilizing.
   # HEMATOMA/PSEUDOANEURYSM:  Patient is s/p repair of pseudoaneurysm
   from [**2198-11-24**], was started on heparin gtt for DVT with continued
   bleeding w/ some extension into retroperitoneum and thigh.  She had a
   IVC filter placed, Plavix was d/ced as was heparin.  HCT now stabilized
   after total of 6U at 30.
   - Dced Plavix as no stent
   - Repeat HCT at 1000, if  HCT stable, can monitor [**Hospital1 **].  Active T&S, 2
   large bore IVs
   - Appreciate vascular consult, will f/u recs.
   - Pt. may OOB to chair today.
   # DVT.  Right femoral DVT in post op setting.  Pt. off heparin now w/
   IVC filter.  This places her at higher risk of IVC thrombosis, but
   given uncertainty whether the bleeding has definitively stopped, will
   not anticoagulate now.
   - Pt. may require OP anticoagulation given IVC filter, this should be
   assessed post ICU setting once HCT is stable.
   # CORONARIES:  Known 3VD with prior CABG.  After ETT showed apical
   ischemia and a hypokinetic septum, performed for progressive dyspnea,
   underwent cardiac cath which showed patent grafts and had a POBA to the
   distal LAD.
   - Continue aspirin and statin
   - Will restart beta-blocker 12.5BID low dose if HCT stable at 1000 and
   SBP > 100mmHg
   # PUMP:  EF of 60% on MIBI done last month.  Not currently in failure.
   # RHYTHM:  In sinus rhythm.
   # HYPOTHYRODISIM:  Continue levothyroxine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   62F with a history of CAD, s/p CABG for severe LM disease who presented
   today for cardiac, now being transferred to the CCU given worry for
   post-cath bleeding.
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient had continued bleeding on heparin yesterday so an IVC filter
   was placed and her heparin was stopped (she is now only on ASA).  She
   received a total of 4 units of PRBC yesterday.  Her Hct was stable this
   am and at 10 am as well as 8pm at 29.  Her metoprolol was restarted at
   12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].  She was allowed to eat again.  Vascular removed her JP
   drain, no new recs otherweise.  Her foley was pulled.  Plan was for her
   to ambulate today and possibly be called out to the floor t/m if her
   hct remains stable.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of CAD, who underwent CABG for severe LM disease. She presented to the hospital with post-cath bleeding and was admitted to the ICU. The patient was found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, which was repaired surgically. She was started on heparin for DVT prophylaxis, but continued to bleed and was eventually switched to ASA. The patient received a total of 4 units of PRBC and her Hct is currently stable at 29%. She has been restarted on metoprolol and is expected to ambulate today. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 118/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient has already experienced significant bleeding and has been switched to ASA. However, there is still a risk of further bleeding, especially with the presence of a pseudoaneurysm.
2. DVT: The patient has been found to have a right femoral DVT and is at risk for IVC thrombosis due to the IVC filter. Anticoagulation may be necessary in the future.
3. Thrombosis: The patient's IVC filter and DVT make her at risk for thrombosis, which could lead to pulmonary embolism or other complications.
4. Infection: The patient has a pseudoaneurysm and may be at risk for infection, especially if the wound is not properly cleaned and dressed.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and has undergone CABG. She may be at risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient has been intubated and may be at risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
7. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, which may indicate underlying kidney disease or acute kidney injury.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's albumin level is low, which may indicate malnutrition or gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Neurological complications: The patient's magnesium level is slightly elevated, which may indicate underlying neurological disease or electrolyte imbalance.
10. Psychological complications: The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, which may indicate underlying psychological distress or anxiety."
