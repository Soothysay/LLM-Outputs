   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   80M admitted in [**Month (only) 1780**] with retroperitoneal mass due to abscess and
   empyema - isolated unusual GNR. He underwent VATS and pig-tailed
   catheter in abscess. He returned to ER with PE while off of coumadin -
   anticoagulation restarted.
   Returns now with hypoxemia and dyspnea. CXR apparently showed new left
   infiltrate and he was treated with CTX/azithro and transferred. In our
   ER, he required bipap then intubation for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure and mental status decline.
   CT-A showed no significant changes from prior CT, head CT negative. He
   was given vanco as well and admitted to ICU.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He has a history of retroperitoneal mass due to abscess and empyema, and has undergone VATS and pig-tailed catheter placement. He has also had a PE while off of coumadin and has been treated with antibiotics.

The patient's current condition is critical, with hypoxemia and dyspnea. He has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. His ABG results show a pH of 7.65, PaCO2 of 34, and PaO2 of 404.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with an endotracheal tube and OG tube in place. His cardiovascular examination shows a normal S1 and S2, but his peripheral vascular examination is limited due to lack of radial pulse assessment. His respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds. His abdominal examination is normal, and his extremities show no edema. His skin examination is not assessed, and his neurologic examination is limited due to sedation.

The patient's lab results show a WBC count of 4.2, Hct of 38.7, and Plt count of 141. His Cr level is 1.1, and his TCO2 level is 39. His glucose level is 104, and his other labs show normal to mildly elevated levels.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Sepsis
3. Respiratory failure
4. Cardiac arrhythmias
5. Renal failure
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)

The patient's plan includes:

1. ICU care
2. Nutrition: enteral feeding
3. Glycemic control: insulin infusion
4. Lines: central venous catheter and arterial line
5. Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis with SQ UF heparin
6. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: pantoprazole
7. VAP prophylaxis: elevation of head of bed and use of subglottic suctioning

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and dyspnea. He has a complex medical history, including retroperitoneal mass due to abscess and empyema, pulmonary embolism (PE), and coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous CABG and atrial fibrillation (AF).

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypoxemia, with an initial ABG showing pH 7.29, pCO2 94, and pO2 81.
3. Chest CT showing no new infiltrates or PE.
4. Head CT initially unremarkable.
5. Rigors suggesting infection, although imaging does not support pneumonia.

The patient is being treated with:

1. Empiric antibiotics for respiratory failure.
2. Ventilatory support.
3. Anticoagulation for PE (doubt).
4. Nutrition, glycemic control, and lines management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Pneumonia, despite initial chest CT showing no new infiltrates.
3. Infection, given the patient's history of empyema and retroperitoneal abscess.
4. Respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in the patient's condition.
5. Cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock, given the patient's history of CAD and AF.

Based on the patient's condition and medical history, it is essential to continue monitoring and managing his respiratory failure, as well as addressing any potential underlying infections or complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 80-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and dyspnea. He has a history of retroperitoneal mass due to abscess and empyema, and has undergone VATS and pig-tailed catheter insertion. He was recently treated for PE and has been anticoagulated.

Current vital signs:

* Temperature: 98.5°F (36.9°C)
* Heart rate: 85 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 142/69 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Ventilator settings: CMV/ASSIST, Vt 550 mL, RR 18, PEEP 5 cmH2O, FiO2 40%, PIP 32 cmH2O, Plateau 25 cmH2O

Lab results:

* Hemoglobin: 11.7 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 4.2 K/uL
* Platelet count: 141 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 39 mEq/L
* Glucose: 104 mg/dL
* Other lab results are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan:

* Respiratory failure is the primary concern, with unclear cause.
* Suspect significant restrictive lung disease due to history of bilateral pleural processes.
* Will continue ventilator support and empiric antibiotics for now.
* Recent PE is doubtful, but will continue anticoagulation.
* Recent empyema and retroperitoneal abscess have completed antibiotics and pig-tail catheter removal.
* Follow blood cultures.

Potential medical complications:

* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Pneumothorax
* Pulmonary embolism
* Respiratory failure due to restrictive lung disease
* Infection due to retained abscess or empyema
* Cardiovascular instability due to hypoxemia and hypercarbic respiratory failure
* Neurologic compromise due to hypoxemia and hypercarbic respiratory failure
* Sepsis due to infection

Recommendations:

* Continue ventilator support and empiric antibiotics.
* Monitor for signs of VAP, pneumothorax, and pulmonary embolism.
* Consider further imaging studies to rule out other causes of respiratory failure.
* Monitor for signs of infection, including fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory failure, and recent empyema and retroperitoneal collections.

The patient is being treated with mechanical ventilation, and his vital signs are stable. He has a fever, but it is not considered acute. His respiratory support is set to a tidal volume of 500 mL, with a respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. His oxygen saturation is 100%.

The patient has a history of unusual Pantoea infection and has been overventilated in the past, which has led to a baseline pCO2 of 60 mmHg. The patient's chest X-ray shows a right upper lobe infiltrate that was not seen on his previous CT or chest X-ray.

The patient has a small pulmonary embolism that is being treated with anticoagulation. He is at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and measures are being taken to prevent this, including elevating his head of bed, performing mouth care, and daily wake-up calls.

The patient's laboratory results show that he has a white blood cell count of 4.2 K/uL, a hematocrit of 38.7%, and a platelet count of 141 K/uL. His troponin-T level is 0.15 ng/mL, and his creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

* Respiratory failure
* Pulmonary embolism (small)
* Acute respiratory failure (not ARDS)
* Recent empyema and retroperitoneal collections
* History of unusual Pantoea infection
* Overventilation in the past
* Small pulmonary embolism being treated with anticoagulation
* Risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Measures being taken to prevent VAP, including elevating head of bed, performing mouth care, and daily wake-up calls

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Pneumothorax
* Pulmonary edema
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrest
* Sepsis
* Organ failure (e.g., renal, hepatic, or cardiac)

The patient's condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and management to prevent these potential complications."

   80M s/p VATS and drainage of an empyema and retroperitoneal abscess
   infected with Pantoea spp (an Enterobacter-like bacteria) and PE on
   warfarin as well as CAD s/p CABG, CHF, and Afib admitted with
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Etiology unclear. R pleural effusion
   improved on CT. No PE on CTA. NCHCT for central cause of respiratory
   failure negative. No infectious workup in the ED, but infection is a
   likely cause. Pt empirically received ceftriaxone, azityhromycin, and
   vancomycin but was not cultured. Of note, his past empyema and
   retroperitoneal abscess were growing Pantoea spp, a Gram negative
   bacteria which can produce a beta lactamase. He was successfully
   treated with levofloxacin in his prior admission. Extubated
   successfully on [**12-18**]. Perhaps hypothyroidism and neuromuscular slowing
   of diaphragm/respiratory muscles contributes to hypercarbia.
   - ABG 12 hours post-extubation with hypercarbia, but oxygenating well;
   repeat with O2 weaned down more to just 1L NC with less hypercarbia
   (ie: he is correcting himself; likely lives at baseline of pCO2 in 60s)

   metronidazole 500mg IV TID, and levofloxacin 750mg IV daily

   on exam. Elevated JVP likely due to known 3+ tricuspid regurgitation;
   mild crackles at right lung base, 1+ b/l pedal edema.

   # Possible infection as cause of decompensation: Pt was treated for
   infection with Pantoea (an Enterobacter-like bacteria) approximately 1

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   80M s/p VATS and drainage of an empyema and retroperitoneal abscess
   infected with Pantoea spp (an Enterobacter-like bacteria) and PE on
   warfarin as well as CAD s/p CABG, CHF, and Afib admitted with
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Etiology unclear. R pleural effusion
   improved on CT. No PE on CTA. NCHCT for central cause of respiratory
   failure negative. No infectious workup in the ED, but infection is a
   likely cause. Pt empirically received ceftriaxone, azityhromycin, and
   vancomycin but was not cultured. Of note, his past empyema and
   retroperitoneal abscess were growing Pantoea spp, a Gram negative
   bacteria which can produce a beta lactamase. He was successfully
   treated with levofloxacin in his prior admission. Extubated
   successfully on [**12-18**]. Perhaps hypothyroidism and neuromuscular slowing
   of diaphragm/respiratory muscles contributes to hypercarbia.
   - ABG 12 hours post-extubation with hypercarbia, but oxygenating well;
   repeat with O2 delivery weaned down more to just 1L NC with less
   hypercarbia (ie: he is correcting himself; likely lives at baseline of
   pCO2 in 60s); also less O2 delivery likely helps his respiratory drive
   to blow off more CO2; seems to be somewhat of a chronic retainer (maybe
   due to physiology s/p effusions and empyema and abscess and surgeries)
   - Follow-up repeat ABG at noon today
 if improved, consider pull
   a-line and send to floor; if pCO2 rises again (or change in MS,
   oxygenation etc.) then non-invasive ventilation as a possibility if
   needed to help with the hypercarbia if he
s not tolerating it
   - Had been treating presumptively for aspiration PNA with vancomycin 1g
   IV BID, metronidazole 500mg IV TID, and levofloxacin 750mg IV daily;
   but afebrile, no leukocytosis, oxygenating well
 so d/c all these
   antibiotics today, and monitor clinically for evidence of
   aspiration/pneumonia/infection
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - Crackles on exam and pedal edema, restart home lasix 40mg PO daily
   .
   # Possible infection as cause of decompensation: Pt was treated for
   infection with Pantoea (an Enterobacter-like bacteria) approximately 1
   month ago. He also is a risk for aspiration.
   - d/c antibiotic treatment for aspiration PNA
   - f/u blood culture and sputum culture
   .
   # Pulmonary embolus: Diagnosed [**2188-11-22**] with segmental pulmonary
   embolism within the anterior basal segment of the right lower lobe
   pulmonary artery. Warfarin as an outpatient. Admission CTA showed no
   further PE.
   - Continue coumadin at 2mg today, then up to 4mg daily (home dose) on
   [**12-20**] (wait until [**12-20**] to bump up the dose, because of the residual
   antibiotic effect on anticoagulation)
   - Maintain up to date type and screen
   .
   # CAD: S/p CABG in [**2182**], chronically in Afib. Vpaced.
   - Continue home ASA 325mg PO daily
   - Continue home pravastatin 80mg PO HS
   - Continue home metoprolol Tartrate 50mg PO daily
   - Continue anticoagulation as above for PE and Afib
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH 35 (significantly elevated); unclear if because
   of not receiving med at rehab versus inappropriate dose
   - Increase home Levothyroxine Sodium 75 mcg PO/NG DAILY to 100mcg
   - Recheck TSH in 1 month (approx mid/late [**2189-1-2**])
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRB, replete electrolytes as needed, advancing diet as
   tolerated, speech & swallow consult f/u. Send nutrition labs (albumin,
   iron, B12, folic acid). PT consult.
   # Prophylaxis: Warfarin as above, pneumoboots, PPI (change IV to PO now
   that extubated)
   # Access: Peripherals, Aline.
   # Communication: Patient and wife.
   # Code:  Full (discussed with wife in [**Name (NI) **]).
   # Disposition: After noon ABG, consider call-out to floor pending pCO2
   and respiratory status. Plan for rehab after hospitalization.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 80-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of pulmonary embolism (PE), acute respiratory failure, and chronic conditions such as coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic atrial fibrillation (Afib), and hypothyroidism.

The patient was treated for hypercarbic respiratory failure, and his respiratory status has improved since extubation. However, he still requires oxygen therapy and has a history of aspiration and potential infection.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 4.2-3.0
* Hct: 38.7-34.8
* Plt: 141
* Cr: 1.1
* TropT: 0.15
* TCO2: 39-36
* Glucose: 104-96
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 22.1/39.7/2.1, CK/CKMB: 23/0.15, ALT/AST: 30/33, Alk Phos/T Bili: 47/0.9, Differential-Neuts: 72.9%, Lymph: 19.4%, Mono: 6.5%, Eos: 0.7%, Lactic Acid: 0.7 mmol/L, Albumin: 3.9 g/dL, LDH: 197 IU/L, Ca++: 8.6 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 4.8 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of PE, which is a potential complication of his chronic conditions.
2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which may be related to his underlying conditions or infections.
3. Aspiration: The patient has a history of aspiration, which is a potential complication of his respiratory failure.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of infection with Pantoea spp, a Gram-negative bacteria, and may be at risk for further infections.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which may be contributing to his respiratory failure.
6. Coronary artery disease: The patient has CAD, which is a chronic condition that may be contributing to his respiratory failure.
7. Chronic atrial fibrillation: The patient has Afib, which is a chronic condition that may be contributing to his respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if he develops further infections or if his underlying conditions progress.
2. Sepsis: The patient's history of infection and his underlying conditions may put him at risk for developing sepsis.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's CAD and Afib may lead to cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's hypothyroidism may lead to neurological complications such as cognitive impairment or muscle weakness.
5. Kidney injury: The patient's underlying conditions and potential infections may lead to kidney injury.

Based on the patient's progress note, it is recommended to continue monitoring his respiratory status and treating his underlying conditions. Further testing and evaluation may be necessary to determine the cause of his respiratory failure and to rule out potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   80 yo man with hypercarbic respiratory failure in setting of recnt R
   empyema and retroperitoneal collections
   Respiratory failure
 Extubated and doing wll.  Transiently hypercarbic
   overnight but better this AM and mentating clearly.  Unclear if there
   was any infectious source precipitating this event - will d/c abx.
   There may a component of hypothyroidism contributing to rspiratory
   failure - TSH of 35 - will give Synthroid 75mcg daily, check FT4, and
   adjust accordingly.  Unclear if he was recieving Synthroid at rehab.
   Hypothyroidism - as above
   PE - Cont anticoagulation for small subsegmental PE.
   Will keep in ICU this AM and monitor ABGs - could be call out to floor
   in afternnoon
   Remainder of issues per ICU team

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 31 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old man who was recently extubated and is currently experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has improved this morning, with a decrease in pCO2 levels from the 90s to the 50s. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and is being monitored for potential complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure can progress to respiratory arrest if not properly managed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's recent empyema and retroperitoneal collections may have increased the risk of pneumonia, which can worsen respiratory failure.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient's TSH level is elevated, indicating hypothyroidism, which can contribute to respiratory failure.
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of PE, which can worsen respiratory failure and increase the risk of thrombotic complications.
5. Infection: The patient's recent antibiotic treatment may not have fully eliminated the underlying infection, which can lead to sepsis and worsen respiratory failure.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiac status is unclear, but the presence of a paced rhythm and potential hypothyroidism may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Monitoring of ABGs to ensure proper oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Anticoagulation therapy to prevent PE recurrence.
3. Treatment of hypothyroidism with Synthroid and monitoring of FT4 levels.
4. Continued antibiotic treatment, pending further evaluation of the patient's infection status.
5. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and cardiovascular function.

The patient's disposition remains in the ICU for further monitoring and treatment."
