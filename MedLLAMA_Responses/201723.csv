   Imaging: [**2-3**] TTE: Marked right ventricular dilation with moderate
   global hypokinesis. Evidence of right ventricular pressure overload.
   Preserved left ventricular systolic function. Moderate tricuspid
   regurgitation. At least moderate pulmonary hypertension which is likely
   underestimated.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-4-10**], the right
   ventricle is now markedly dilated and moderately hypokinetic.
   [**2-3**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**1-29**], there has been
   placement of an orogastric tube that extends well into the stomach.
   Large central catheter from the right IJ region extends to the region
   of the right atrium. Left IJ catheter extends to the mid to lower
   portion of the SVC.
     There is some increased opacification at the left base that could
   reflect some
   atelectasis or possibly even small effusion, though this could also
   represent an artifact.
   [**2-3**] CTA (Preliminary read): No acute PE. Large right ventricle. Small
   simple right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. Patchy
   opacity in the left lung base concerning for infection. Fatty liver
   with perihepatic simple fluid. Large axillary lymph nodes bilaterally.
   [**2-3**] Head CT (Preliminary): No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
   Microbiology: [**2-3**] Mini-BAL: GRAM STAIN: 2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):
   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES. NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
   [**2-3**] BCx: Pending
   Assessment and Plan
   51yo F with h/o diastolic CHF, chronic renal insufficiency, HTN, DM,
   autonomic and peripheral neuropathy admitted with increasing LE edema,
   shortness of breath and weight gain consistent with acute on chronic
   exacerbation of renal failure and diastolic CHF; with initial diuresis
   to Lasix gtt who then became anuric on [**2-2**]; on [**2-3**] was noted to
   become increasingly obtunded with new onset hypopnea, hypotension and
   worsened metabolic acidosis / uremia prompted transfer to the MICU.
   # Hypotension: Has been weaned off vasopressors since midnight, with
   MAPs now consistently in 60-70s. Hypotension and bradycardia responded
   well to glucagon overnight. In regards to etiologies, TTE revealed
   significant RV compromise, although LV function apparently intact.
   Troponins elevated around baseline level, but CK/MB flat. Random
   cortisol elevated, which argues against adrenal insufficiency.
   Afebrile, but has leukocytosis, possibly consistent with septic
   etiology-infectious workup unrevealing thus far. Also has taken
   Labetolol and Morphine, with potentially decreased renal clearance
   - Monitor, now slightly hypertensive (will try to take fluid off today
   with CVVHD)
   # Altered mental status: Patient intubated for obtundation. Currently
   on fentanyl, midazolam. Possible etiologies for initial decrease in
   alertness include uremia, accumulation of narcotics.
   - Continue intubation for airway protection
   - C/w CVVH for uremia/acidosis
   - Can not rule out pneumonia and ground glass opacities on CT
   suggestive of possible atypicals. Continue Vanc/Flagyl/Cefepime and
   start Levofloxacin for atypicals
   # Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury/Metabolic acidosis: Patient has known
   Stage IV CKD, [**1-13**] DM/Htn. HD catheter placed yesterday, prior to
   decompensation. pH improving from 7.08 -> 7.31. Lactate slowly
   uptrending.
   - C/w CVVH for metabolic abnormalities, acid/base status
 and volume
   removal
   - C/w prismasate dialysate fluid, with elevated HCO3 content
   - Monitor lactates with blood gases
   - F/u renal recommendations
   # Leukocytosis:Infectious workup unrevealing. Abrupt rise may be
   related to neupogen therapy.
   - Can not rule out pneumonia and ground glass opacities on CT
   suggestive of possible atypicals. Start Levofloxacin for atypicals
    - F/u outstanding culture data
    - C/w empiric ABx tx with Vanc / Cefepime / Flagyl, as well as empiric
   PO Vancomycin for C.diff
   # Sinus Bradycardia: Could be related to Atenolol given 65% clearance
   from kidneys and was taking 800 mg po TID until the day of transfer.
   Responded quite well to glucagon 5mg IV X1 yesterday
   - Continue to monitor
   # Congestive heart failure: Volume overloaded on exam (LE edema, JVD,
   audible crackles). Has known elevated PA systolic HTN secondary to
   diastolic dysfunction proven on R heart cath 6/[**2193**]. Most recently may
   simply be [**1-13**] to worsened renal failure. TTE with significant LV
   dysfunction, as above. Cardiac enzymes worsening although EKG this
   morning not significant changed from baseline
   - Guaiac stools and transfuse one pRBC for cardiac disease and Hct<30
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes until they peak and then continue heparin gtt
   48 hours beyond
   - Already on heparin gtt for ?PE on CTA (prelim read still)
   - Continue aspirin and will start statin today
   - Likely still has beta blockade on board from Atenolol, after glucagon
   treatment. Will consider short acting, low dose beta blocker tomorrow
   - Will add LFTs to AM labs for possible initiation of statin
   - Cardiology still following patient, as she was transferred from [**Hospital Ward Name 383**]
   3 service. Will touch base with them this morning, including possible
   cardiac catheterization
   - Consider Swan Ganz catheterization for pulmonary hypertension and
   cardiac pressures
   - Fluid managment by CVVH
   # Chronic pruritic rash: Developed in the past half a year per recent
   discharge summary and thought to be due to drug reaction.
    - Clarify with primary team whether Dermatology was consulted
    - Sarna PRN once more alert
   # Diabetes: At home regimen on Glargine 22u at bedtime.  This was
   continued inpatient.  Now will be NPO s/p intubation.
    - Will increase humalog sliding scale and see what patient requires
   for tailored glargine dose tomorrow
    - OG/NG tube, start Glucose / Renal TF
   # Depression.  Unclear level of control.
   - Hold Fluoxetine while NPO
   - Restart in AM via OG
   # Fractured R humerus: Seen by Ortho inpatient.  NWB.

   obtundation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, who was admitted with increasing leg edema, shortness of breath, and weight gain. She was initially treated with diuresis, but became anuric and was transferred to the ICU due to worsening metabolic acidosis, uremia, and obtundation. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and is being treated with vasopressors, antibiotics, and dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is a concern, especially given her history of chronic renal insufficiency and diastolic heart failure. Further monitoring and treatment are necessary to ensure her blood pressure remains stable.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's obtundation and altered mental status are a concern, and may be related to uremia, accumulation of narcotics, or other factors. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to determine the cause and prevent further decline.
3. Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury/Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's acute kidney injury and metabolic acidosis are a concern, especially given her history of chronic renal insufficiency. Further treatment, including dialysis and correction of electrolyte imbalances, is necessary to prevent further decline.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be related to infectious etiology or neupogen therapy. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to determine the cause and prevent further decline.
5. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's congestive heart failure is a concern, especially given her history of diastolic heart failure and chronic renal insufficiency. Further treatment, including diuresis and vasopressors, is necessary to manage her heart failure and prevent further decline.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's cough and fever may be related to pneumonia, and further evaluation and treatment are necessary to determine the cause and prevent further decline.
7. C.diff Colitis: The patient's diarrhea and abdominal pain may be related to C.diff colitis, and further evaluation and treatment are necessary to determine the cause and prevent further decline.
8. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia is a concern, especially given her history of chronic renal insufficiency. Further treatment, including correction of electrolyte imbalances, is necessary to prevent further decline.
9. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a concern, especially given her history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic renal insufficiency. Further treatment, including mechanical ventilation and diuresis, is necessary to manage her respiratory failure and prevent further decline.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition and multiple comorbidities make her at high risk for further decline and complications. Close monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent further decline and improve her outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Large central catheter from the right IJ region extends to the region
   of the right atrium. Left IJ catheter extends to the mid to lower
   portion of the SVC.
     There is some increased opacification at the left base that could
   reflect some
   atelectasis or possibly even small effusion, though this could also
   represent an artifact.
   [**2-3**] CTA (Preliminary read): No acute PE. Large right ventricle. Small
   simple right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. Patchy
   opacity in the left lung base concerning for infection. Fatty liver
   with perihepatic simple fluid. Large axillary lymph nodes bilaterally.

   Assessment and Plan
   51yo F with h/o diastolic CHF, chronic renal insufficiency, HTN, DM,
   autonomic and peripheral neuropathy admitted with increasing LE edema,
   shortness of breath and weight gain consistent with acute on chronic
   exacerbation of renal failure and diastolic CHF; with initial diuresis
   to Lasix gtt who then became anuric on [**2-2**]; on [**2-3**] was noted to
   become increasingly obtunded with new onset hypopnea, hypotension and
   worsened metabolic acidosis / uremia prompted transfer to the MICU.
   # Hypotension: Has been weaned off vasopressors since midnight, with
   MAPs now consistently in 60-70s. In regards to etiologies, TTE revealed
   significant RV compromise, although LV function apparently intact.
   Troponins elevated around baseline level, but CK/MB flat. Random
   cortisol elevated, which argues against adrenal insufficiency.
   Afebrile, but has leukocytosis, possibly consistent with septic
   etiology-infectious workup unrevealing thus far. Also has taken
   Labetolol and Morphine, with potentially decreased renal clearance
   - Monitor
   # Altered mental status: Patient intubated for obtundation. Currently
   on fentanyl, midazolam. Possible etiologies for initial decrease in
   alertness include uremia, accumulation of narcotics.
   - Continue intubation for airway protection
   - C/w CVVH for uremia/acidosis
   # Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury/Metabolic acidosis: Patient has known
   Stage IV CKD, [**1-13**] DM/Htn. HD catheter placed yesterday, prior to
   decompensation. pH improving from 7.08 -> 7.31. Lactate slowly
   uptrending.
   - C/w CVVH for metabolic abnormalities, acid/base status
   - C/w prismasate dialysate fluid, with elevated HCO3 content
   - Monitor lactates with blood gases
   - F/u renal recommendations
   # Leukocytosis:Infectious workup unrevealing. Abrupt rise may be
   related to neupogen therapy.
    - F/u outstanding culture data
    - C/w empiric ABx tx with Vanc / Cefepime / Flagyl, as well as empiric
   PO Vancomycin for C.diff
   # Sinus Bradycardia: Could be related to Atenolol given 65% clearance
   from kidneys and was taking 800 mg po TID until the day of transfer.
    - Trial glucacon 5mg IV x 1
   # Congestive heart failure: Volume overloaded on exam (LE edema, JVD,
   audible crackles). Has known elevated PA systolic HTN secondary to
   diastolic dysfunction proven on R heart cath 6/[**2193**]. Most recently may
   simply be [**1-13**] to worsened renal failure. TTE with significant LV
   dysfunction, as above. Cardiac enzymes generally negative, as above.
    - EKG now
    - Fluid managment by CVVH
   # Chronic pruritic rash: Developed in the past half a year per recent
   dc summary and thought to be due to drug reaction.
    - Clarify with primary team whether Dermatology was consulted
    - Sarna PRN once more alert
   # Diabetes: At home regimen on Glargine 22u at bedtime.  This was
   continued inpatient.  Now will be NPO s/p intubation.
    - D/c glargine, continue with humalog SS
    - OG/NG tube, start Glucose / Renal TF
   # Depression.  Unclear level of control.
   - Hold Fluoxetine while NPO

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, and diabetes. She presented with increasing lower extremity edema, shortness of breath, and weight gain, consistent with acute exacerbation of renal failure and diastolic congestive heart failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated for airway protection, on invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
* Cardiovascular: Hypotensive, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60-70 mmHg, despite being weaned off vasopressors. The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, and the echocardiogram revealed significant right ventricular compromise, although left ventricular function appears intact.
* Renal: The patient has known stage IV chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is on hemodialysis. She has developed acute on chronic kidney injury and metabolic acidosis, with a pH of 7.31 and lactate levels slowly uptrending.
* Neurological: The patient is obtunded and intubated, with a possible etiology for initial decrease in alertness including uremia, accumulation of narcotics, or septic etiology.
* Infectious: The patient has leukocytosis, possibly related to neutropenia therapy, and an infectious workup is unrevealing.
* Endocrine: The patient has diabetes, and her medication regimen is being adjusted.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of congestive heart failure: The patient's right ventricular compromise and history of diastolic congestive heart failure make her susceptible to worsening cardiac function.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's current condition, including hypotension, metabolic acidosis, and uremia, increases her risk of developing acute kidney injury.
3. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and infectious workup unrevealing may indicate the presence of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and she is at risk of developing respiratory failure.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and the use of anticoagulants increase her risk of bleeding complications.
6. Neurological deterioration: The patient's obtundation and possible etiologies for decreased alertness, including uremia, accumulation of narcotics, or septic etiology, make her susceptible to neurological deterioration.
7. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and infectious workup unrevealing may indicate the presence of infection, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan should be implemented:

1. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely, including blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac enzymes.
2. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory status, including adjusting ventilation settings and oxygenation levels as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function closely, including creatinine levels, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, and electrolyte levels.
4. Continue to manage the patient's infectious workup, including culturing blood, urine, and other bodily fluids.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely, including assessing for signs of sepsis, such as fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status.
6. Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist to evaluate the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and potential complications.
7. Consider consulting with a cardiologist to evaluate the patient's cardiac function and potential complications.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
   51yo F with h/o diastolic CHF, chronic renal insufficiency, HTN, DM,
   autonomic and peripheral neuropathy admitted with increasing LE edema,
   shortness of breath and weight gain consistent with acute on chronic
   exacerbation of renal failure and diastolic CHF; with initial diuresis
   to Lasix gtt who then became anuric on [**2-2**]; on [**2-3**] was noted to
   become increasingly obtunded with new onset hypopnea, hypotension and
   worsened metabolic acidosis / uremia prompted transfer to the MICU.
   # Respiratory status: Hypercarbic last evening, switched back to A/C
   with improvement in blood gases. CXR with possible airspace
   consolidation. Extubated this AM during rounds, doing well. Cannot rule
   out pneumonia and ground glass opacities on CT suggestive of possible
   atypicals.
   - Continue Vanc/Flagyl/Cefepime for 4-day course
   - F/u final CT read
   - F/u BAL cx data (2+ polys ngtd)
   # Altered mental status: S/p extubation she is anxious, crying, but
   responds appropriately. Uremia significantly improved on CVVH. D/w
   renal switching to HD.
   - Monitor MS
   - C/w CVVH for uremia/acidosis, consider HD
   # Hypertension: Now with systolic pressures in 170-190s. Off pressors x
   24 hrs. Labetalol toxicity from prolonged clearance in setting of renal
   failure a possible exacerbating factor of initial hypotension, now
   requiring boluses of anti-hypertensives (lopressor, hydralazine). 4+
   liters taken off with CVVH yesterday. Known significant RV compromise,
   although LV function apparently intact.
   - Continue with fluid removal by CVVH
   - Monitor
   # Congestive heart failure: Volume overloaded on exam (LE edema, JVD,
   audible crackles). Has known elevated PA systolic HTN secondary to
   diastolic dysfunction proven on R heart cath 6/[**2193**]. Most recently may

   dysfunction, as above. Cardiac enzymes worsening although EKG this
   morning not significant changed from baseline
   - Guaiac stools and transfuse one pRBC for cardiac disease and Hct<30
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes until they peak and then continue heparin gtt

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still requiring mechanical ventilation and has a history of respiratory failure. There is a possibility of pneumonia or atelectasis, which can worsen respiratory status.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, and hypertension. The recent cardiac enzymes suggest worsening cardiac function, which can lead to further complications such as cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease and is currently experiencing metabolic acidosis. This can lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, or even death if not managed promptly.
4. Infections: The patient has a history of leukocytosis and is at risk for developing infections, particularly pneumonia. The patient is receiving antibiotics, but the risk of infection persists.
5. Renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease and is currently experiencing acute kidney injury. This can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and even end-stage renal disease.
6. Neurological complications: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which can be a sign of uremia, electrolyte imbalances, or other neurological complications.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and further complications.
8. Hemodynamic instability: The patient is experiencing hypertension, which can lead to further complications such as cardiac failure, stroke, or even death.
9. Fluid overload: The patient is experiencing fluid overload, which can lead to further complications such as cardiac failure, respiratory distress, or even death.
10. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient is experiencing electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or even death.

Based on these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent or mitigate these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   51yo F with h/o diastolic CHF, chronic renal insufficiency, HTN, DM,
   autonomic and peripheral neuropathy admitted with increasing LE edema,
   shortness of breath and weight gain consistent with acute on chronic
   exacerbation of renal failure and diastolic CHF; with initial diuresis
   to Lasix gtt who then became anuric on [**2-2**]; on [**2-3**] was noted to
   become increasingly obtunded with new onset hypopnea, hypotension and
   worsened metabolic acidosis / uremia prompted transfer to the MICU.
   # Hypertension: Now with systolic pressures in 170-190s. Off pressors x
   24 hrs. Labetalol toxicity from prolonged clearance in setting of renal
   failure a possible exacerbating factor of initial hypotension, now
   requiring boluses of anti-hypertensives (lopressor, hydralazine). 4+
   liters taken off with CVVH yesterday. Known significant RV compromise,
   although LV function apparently intact.
   - Continue with fluid removal by CVVH
   - Monitor
   # Mechanical ventilation: Hypercarbic last evening, switched back to
   A/C with improvement in blood gases. CXR with possible airspace
   consolidation
   - SBT this morning
   - Can not rule out pneumonia and ground glass opacities on CT
   suggestive of possible atypicals. Continue Vanc/Flagyl/Cefepime and
   start Levofloxacin for atypicals
   - F/u final CT read
   # Altered mental status: Sedated with propofol, but responding
   appropriately to verbal stimuli. Uremia significantly improved on CVVH.
   Patient intubated for obtundation.
   - Continue intubation for airway protection
   - C/w CVVH for uremia/acidosis
   # Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury/Metabolic acidosis: Patient has known
   Stage IV CKD, [**1-13**] DM/Htn. Lactate stable.
   - C/w CVVH for metabolic abnormalities, acid/base status
 and volume
   removal
   - Monitor lactates with blood gases
   - F/u renal recommendations
   # Leukocytosis:Infectious workup unrevealing. Abrupt rise may be
   related to neupogen therapy.
    - Abx as above for ? pneumonia on chest imaging
    - F/u outstanding culture data
   # Congestive heart failure: Volume overloaded on exam (LE edema, JVD,
   audible crackles). Has known elevated PA systolic HTN secondary to
   diastolic dysfunction proven on R heart cath 6/[**2193**]. Most recently may
   simply be [**1-13**] to worsened renal failure. TTE with significant RV
   dysfunction, as above. Cardiac enzymes worsening although EKG this
   morning not significant changed from baseline
   - Guaiac stools and transfuse one pRBC for cardiac disease and Hct<30
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes until they peak and then continue heparin gtt
   48 hours beyond
   - Continue aspirin and will start statin today
   - LFT's generally normal--c/w statin
   - Consider Swan Ganz catheterization for pulmonary hypertension and
   cardiac pressures
   - Fluid managment by CVVH
   # Chronic pruritic rash: Developed in the past half a year per recent
   discharge summary and thought to be due to drug reaction.
    - Clarify with primary team whether Dermatology was consulted
    - Sarna PRN once more alert
   # Diabetes: C/w glargine and SS
    - OG/NG tube, start Glucose / Renal TF
   # Depression.  Unclear level of control.
   - Hold Fluoxetine while NPO
   - Restart in AM via OG
   # Fractured R humerus: Seen by Ortho inpatient.  NWB.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of diastolic CHF, chronic renal insufficiency, HTN, DM, autonomic and peripheral neuropathy, who was admitted with increasing LE edema, shortness of breath, and weight gain consistent with acute on chronic exacerbation of renal failure and diastolic CHF. She was initially treated with diuresis to Lasix, but became anuric and was transferred to the MICU due to worsening metabolic acidosis and uremia. She has been receiving CVVH, mechanical ventilation, and antibiotics for suspected pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertension: The patient's systolic blood pressure has been in the range of 170-190 mmHg, which may be a sign of labetalol toxicity due to prolonged clearance in the setting of renal failure. This may require further adjustment of antihypertensive medications.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's CXR shows possible airspace consolidation, which may be indicative of pneumonia. The patient is receiving antibiotics, but further evaluation and treatment may be necessary.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis has been improving with CVVH, but may require further monitoring and treatment to ensure normalization of blood pH levels.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has known Stage IV CKD, and her renal function may continue to deteriorate if not managed properly. CVVH may be necessary to remove excess fluid and electrolytes.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be related to Neupogen therapy, but further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to rule out infectious causes.
6. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's volume overload may be contributing to her congestive heart failure, and further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to manage this condition.
7. Chronic Pruritic Rash: The patient's chronic pruritic rash may be related to a drug reaction, and further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to manage this condition.
8. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes may require further management, including adjustments to her insulin regimen and glucose monitoring.
9. Depression: The patient's depression may require further evaluation and treatment, including the use of antidepressant medications.
10. Fractured Right Humerus: The patient's fractured right humerus may require further evaluation and treatment, including the use of pain management medications and physical therapy.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   51yo F with h/o diastolic CHF, chronic renal insufficiency, HTN, DM,
   autonomic and peripheral neuropathy admitted with increasing LE edema,
   shortness of breath and weight gain consistent with acute on chronic
   exacerbation of renal failure and diastolic CHF; with initial diuresis
   to Lasix gtt who then became anuric on [**2-2**]; on [**2-3**] was noted to
   become increasingly obtunded with new onset hypopnea, hypotension and
   worsened metabolic acidosis / uremia prompted transfer to the MICU.
   # Respiratory status: Stable off ventilator x 24 hrs. CXR with possible
   airspace consolidation, but BAL culture with only small amounts
   commensal flora. Not coughing, afebrile, and leukocytosis trending
   downwards. CT chest reported as having bilateral large axillary lymph
   nodes that may require repeat scan after resolution of acute issues.

   - Monitor
   # Altered mental status: Emotionally labile immediately
   post-extubation, now significantly clearer, oriented. Social work
   consult placed for patient/family coping.
   - Monitor MS
   - SW recs
   # Hypertension: Continues to remain hypertensive despite large amounts
   of fluid removal on CVVH. Outpatient anti-hypertensive regimen includes
   hydralazine, labetalol, furosemide. Known significant RV compromise,
   although LV function apparently intact. [**Month (only) 8**] be stopping CVVH and
   transitioning to intermittent HD today.
   - If remains hypertensive despite fluid removal by RRT, consider slowly
   adding back home anti-hypertensives; may not require dose adjustment
   for renal function if going to remain on chronic HD.
   # Congestive heart failure: Volume overload significantly improved,
   given 17 kg fluid removal on CVVH over past 4 days. Possible small
   bilateral pleural effusion on CXR yesterday, but clinically euvolemic
   today. TTE with significant RV dysfunction in setting of known
   pulmonary Htn. Cardiac enzymes elevated, believed to be [**1-13**] RV strain,
   per primary cardiologist
   - Continue aspirin & statin
   - Consider adding back beta blocker when hemodynamics are at goal
   - Fluid management by CVVH vs HD

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of diastolic heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted with increasing leg edema, shortness of breath, and weight gain, consistent with acute on chronic exacerbation of renal failure and diastolic heart failure. She was initially treated with diuresis, but became anuric and was transferred to the ICU due to worsening metabolic acidosis and uremia.

The patient has undergone invasive ventilation and has been extubated. She is currently on propofol for sedation and is comfortable, but hypertensive. She has a tunneled line in place and is receiving continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) with fluid removal.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated cardiac enzymes, likely due to right ventricular strain, and abnormal kidney function. Her respiratory status is stable, but she has a small bilateral pleural effusion on CXR. She has a history of chronic pruritic rash and is being treated with antibiotics for possible pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite fluid removal on CVVH, and she may require additional treatment to manage her hypertension.
2. Right ventricular failure: The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, and she has a small bilateral pleural effusion on CXR, which may indicate right ventricular strain and failure.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's kidney function is abnormal, and she is receiving CVVH to manage her fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has a small bilateral pleural effusion on CXR and is being treated with antibiotics for possible pneumonia.
5. Chronic kidney disease: The patient has known stage IV chronic kidney disease and is at risk for further kidney damage.
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a history of metabolic acidosis, which may worsen if her kidney function continues to decline.
7. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are low, which may require supplementation.
8. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are high, which may require treatment to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
9. Fluid overload: The patient has fluid overload, which may require continued treatment with CVVH or intermittent hemodialysis.
10. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, which may recur if her infection is not adequately treated."

   51yo F with h/o diastolic CHF, chronic renal insufficiency, HTN, DM,
   autonomic and peripheral neuropathy admitted with increasing LE edema,
   shortness of breath and weight gain consistent with acute on chronic
   exacerbation of renal failure and diastolic CHF; with initial diuresis
   to Lasix gtt who then became anuric on [**2-2**]; on [**2-3**] was noted to
   become increasingly obtunded with new onset hypopnea, hypotension and
   worsened metabolic acidosis / uremia prompted transfer to the MICU.
   # Respiratory status: Stable off ventilator x 24 hrs and on room air.
   CXR with possible airspace consolidation, but BAL culture with only
   small amounts commensal flora. Not coughing, afebrile, and leukocytosis

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, and diabetes. She was admitted with increasing lower extremity edema, shortness of breath, and weight gain, consistent with an acute exacerbation of renal failure and diastolic CHF.

The patient has undergone significant fluid removal on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) over the past 4 days, resulting in a 17 kg weight loss. Her respiratory status is stable, and she has been extubated for 24 hours. Her mental status has improved, and she is now oriented.

The patient's hypertension remains a concern, despite fluid removal on CVVH. Her cardiac enzymes are elevated, indicating RV strain, and her cardiac function is compromised. She has a small bilateral pleural effusion on CXR, but is clinically euvolemic.

The patient's acute kidney injury has been managed with CVVH, and she will be transitioning to intermittent hemodialysis (HD) today. Her metabolic acidosis has improved, and her lactate levels are stable.

The patient's leukocytosis is trending down, and her infectious workup has been unrevealing. She has a chronic pruritic rash, which may be related to a drug reaction.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continuing aspirin and statin therapy
* Restarting beta blocker therapy when hemodynamics are at goal
* Fluid management by CVVH vs HD
* Re-Echo to assess cardiac function
* Transitioning to intermittent HD today
* Restarting fluoxetine for depression
* Clarifying the management of her chronic pruritic rash

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of cardiac function and RV strain
* Development of acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease
* Hypertensive crisis or worsening of hypertension
* Metabolic acidosis or worsening of metabolic acidosis
* Infection or sepsis, given the patient's leukocytosis and history of respiratory failure
* Development of pulmonary edema or worsening of existing pulmonary edema
* Need for further fluid removal or hemodynamic support
* Potential for bleeding or hemorrhage due to anticoagulation therapy
* Need for further management of her chronic pruritic rash."
