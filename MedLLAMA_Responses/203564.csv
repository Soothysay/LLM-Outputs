You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema with an acute exacerbation. The patient is being treated for hyperglycemia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.9°F)
* Heart rate: 114 bpm (112-119 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 112/61 mmHg (72-118/66 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 25 inspirations per minute (14-27 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 95%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Overweight/obese
* Cardiovascular: Normal PMI, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds
* Respiratory: Symmetric chest expansion, resonant percussion, clear breath sounds
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present, distended, obese
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, but movement and tone are not assessed

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 14.1 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 28.8%
* Platelet count: 496 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* TropT: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 410 mg/dL
* Other labs: CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 60/<0.01, Ca++: 8.5 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL, PO4: 3.0 mg/dL

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is elevated, which may lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, or even cerebral edema.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's COPD with acute exacerbation increases the risk of developing ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and temperature may indicate an underlying infection, which could progress to sepsis.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests possible AKI, which can lead to chronic kidney disease or even end-stage renal disease.
5. Pressure ulcers: The patient's obesity and immobility increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and COPD increase the risk of developing DVT.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's hyperglycemia and COPD increase the risk of developing stress ulcer.

The patient's plan includes:

* ICU care
* Nutrition: unknown
* Glycemic control: unknown
* Lines: 20-gauge line inserted on [**2151-1-18**] 01:35 AM
* Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, VAP prophylaxis

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications that can arise:

Patient Summary:

* 41-year-old woman with diabetes, hypertension, CVA, and severe asthma
* Presented with respiratory distress and hyperglycemia requiring insulin gtt
* Currently receiving insulin gtt, steroids, bronchodilators, and home meds
* Has a history of severe asthma exacerbations and is at risk for respiratory failure

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe asthma exacerbation and respiratory distress increase the risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and even cardiac arrest.
2. Hyperglycemic Crisis: The patient's hyperglycemia (glucose levels 330-410 mg/dL) increases the risk of hyperglycemic crisis, which can lead to ketoacidosis, coma, and even death if not managed promptly and effectively.
3. Sepsis: The patient's underlying conditions (diabetes, hypertension, CVA) increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and mortality.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's CVA and hypertension increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and stroke.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's CVA and hyperglycemia increase the risk of neurological complications, such as cerebral edema, seizures, and increased intracranial pressure.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's hyperglycemia and underlying conditions increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
7. Infection: The patient's underlying conditions and presence of drains increase the risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.

Given the patient's critical condition, it is essential to monitor her closely for any signs of deterioration and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

   Imaging: [**1-17**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. Left ventricular hypertrophy. Poor R
   wave progression could be due to left ventricular hypertrophy.
   Non-specific inferolateral ST-T wave changes could be due to left
   ventricular hypertrophy and/or myocardial ischemia. Compared to the
   previous tracing of [**2150-11-9**] sinus tachycardia is absent and T wave
   flattening is more pronounced in the inferior leads.
   [**1-17**] CXR: Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis. No focal
   consolidation seen.
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 41 year old female with asthma, DM2, HTN, vertigo,
   depression, CVA, admitted for shortness of breath and chest pain [**12-29**]
   asthma exacerbation who developed hyperglycemia in the setting of
   missing her insulin while in the ED, receiving steroids and her insulin
   underdosed on the floor, transferred to the MICU for insulin gtt.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: [**12-29**] steroids and missed/underdosing of insulin
   previously this admission. Remains difficult to manage blood sugars in
   MICU over the course of yesterday.
   -Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs from this morning: ?Will give Lantus 180 units,
   turn drip off four hours later and start sliding scale. Tomorrow add
   NPH 240 units am and 40 units HS. For all doses > 100 units split the
   dose and inject at different sites
   -recheck lytes (though no gap) tomorrow
   -if no gap develops, hope to transition back to interval dosing of
   insulin as [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs (see above)
   - Longstanding OSA likely has resulted in hyperadrenergic state
   hypercortisol levels
 insulin resistance. Encourage strict compliance
   with NPPV, which may aide with blood sugar management
   .
   # Shortness of Breath: Likely multifactorial, consistent with previous
   asthma/COPD exacerbations (wheezing, decreased peak flow, improvement
   with nebs and steroids) and patient with notable restrictive component
   to her SBO due to obesity and deconditioning.  [**Month (only) 11**] also have evolving
   pulm htn from OSA and not wearing bipap at home. No signs of PNA (CXR
   unchanged, no cough, fever, white count). CHF unlikely (NL echo [**2149**],
   no edema or JVD, no CXR evidence).  PE remains a possibility given her
   tachy and immobilization and recent initiation of Xolair. D dimer
   checked and was 557, which is similar or less than three prior
   hospitalizations in the past 15 months with similar presentations. Each
   time, D-Dimer obtained, D-Dimer was mildly positive, and pt was ruled
   out for PE by negative V/Q scan, treated for Asthma exacerbation and
   improved. Given this hx, PE is unlikely, but will consider V Q scan if
   patient does not improve tonight.
   -Continue Prednisone 60mg PO daily for presumed COPD exacerbation; will
   discuss appropriate taper with [**Last Name (un) 294**]
   -continue nebs with Albuterol, Ipratropium
   -continue home inhalers with anti-leukotriene, and Advair
   -NPPV overnight, encourage compliance
   .
   # Chest Pain: Reproducible with palpation so likely MSK/non-cardiac
   chest pain. Unlikely ACS as no EKG changes, CE negative x 3. GI related
   pain also possible, but unlikely reflux given pt on Omeprazole and
   Ranitidine at home. Could be constipation.
   - Morphine 15mg PO Q6H PRN pain
   - continue home dose Omeprazole and Ranitidine.
   .
   #Tachycardia: Likely [**12-29**] anxiety, pain and inhalers. Less likely PE.
   Also has baseline tachycardia, 100-110 range at clinic visits in OMR.
   -IVF, glucose control
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient normotensive on arrival to the ICU.
   -continue home lisinopril
   .
   #Peripheral Neuropathy:
   -continue gabapentin
   -continue Amitriptyline
   -continue lidocaine patch

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 41 year old female with asthma, DM2, HTN, vertigo,
   depression, CVA, admitted for shortness of breath and chest pain [**12-29**]
   asthma exacerbation who developed hyperglycemia in the setting of
   missing her insulin while in the ED, receiving steroids and her insulin
   underdosed on the floor, transferred to the MICU for insulin gtt.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: [**12-29**] steroids and missed/underdosing of insulin
   previously this admission. Remains difficult to manage blood sugars in
   MICU over the course of yesterday.
   -Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs from this morning: ?Will give Lantus 180 units,
   turn drip off four hours later and start sliding scale. Tomorrow add
   NPH 240 units am and 40 units HS. For all doses > 100 units split the
   dose and inject at different sites
   -recheck lytes (though no gap) tomorrow
   -if no gap develops, hope to transition back to interval dosing of
   insulin as [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs (see above)
   - Longstanding OSA likely has resulted in hyperadrenergic state
   hypercortisol levels
 insulin resistance. Encourage strict compliance
   with NPPV, which may aide with blood sugar management
   .
   # Shortness of Breath: Likely multifactorial, consistent with previous
   asthma/COPD exacerbations (wheezing, decreased peak flow, improvement
   with nebs and steroids) and patient with notable restrictive component
   to her SBO due to obesity and deconditioning.  [**Month (only) 11**] also have evolving
   pulm htn from OSA and not wearing bipap at home. No signs of PNA (CXR
   unchanged, no cough, fever, white count). CHF unlikely (NL echo [**2149**],
   no edema or JVD, no CXR evidence).  PE remains a possibility given her
   tachy and immobilization and recent initiation of Xolair. D dimer
   checked and was 557, which is similar or less than three prior
   hospitalizations in the past 15 months with similar presentations. Each
   time, D-Dimer obtained, D-Dimer was mildly positive, and pt was ruled
   out for PE by negative V/Q scan, treated for Asthma exacerbation and
   improved. Given this hx, PE is unlikely, but will consider V Q scan if
   patient does not improve tonight.
   -Continue Prednisone 60mg PO daily for presumed COPD exacerbation; will
   discuss appropriate taper with [**Last Name (un) 294**]
   -continue nebs with Albuterol, Ipratropium
   -continue home inhalers with anti-leukotriene, and Advair
   -NPPV overnight, encourage compliance
   .
   # Chest Pain: Reproducible with palpation so likely MSK/non-cardiac
   chest pain. Unlikely ACS as no EKG changes, CE negative x 3. GI related
   pain also possible, but unlikely reflux given pt on Omeprazole and
   Ranitidine at home. Could be constipation.
   - Morphine 15mg PO Q6H PRN pain
   - continue home dose Omeprazole and Ranitidine.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old female with a complex medical history, including asthma, diabetes type 2, hypertension, vertigo, depression, and a previous CVA. She was admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath and chest pain, which was later determined to be likely multifactorial, including asthma/COPD exacerbations, obesity, and deconditioning.

The patient's hyperglycemia has been difficult to manage, and she has been receiving insulin via a drip. The plan is to continue the insulin drip and adjust the dosage as needed to achieve better glycemic control.

The patient's respiratory status is a concern, with wheezing and decreased peak flow, which is consistent with her asthma/COPD exacerbation. She is receiving nebs, prednisone, and mag for wheezing, and will continue to receive these medications.

The patient's chest pain is likely non-cardiac, possibly related to musculoskeletal or gastrointestinal issues. She is receiving morphine for pain management.

The patient's tachycardia is likely related to anxiety, pain, and inhalers, and is being monitored closely.

The patient's hypertension is being managed with her home medication, lisinopril.

The patient's peripheral neuropathy, spinal stenosis, HLD, depression, and vertigo are being managed with various medications and therapies.

The patient's constipation is being managed with increased bowel regimen and increased narcotic use.

The patient's urinary retention is being managed with a Foley catheter.

The patient's OSA is being managed with CPAP, and she will continue to receive nebs and steroids.

The patient's final status is wheelchair-bound with limited mobility, and a physical therapy consult has been ordered.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hyperglycemia: Continued difficulty in managing blood sugars, leading to potential complications such as DKA or hyperosmolar nonketotic coma.
2. Respiratory failure: Prolonged respiratory failure can lead to respiratory acidosis, hypercapnia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
4. Infections: The patient's immunosuppressed state and use of steroids can increase the risk of infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
5. Constipation: Prolonged constipation can lead to bowel obstruction, hemorrhoids, and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Urinary retention: Prolonged urinary retention can lead to urinary tract infections, bladder damage, and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. OSA: Continued OSA can lead to hypercarbia, apnea, and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Peripheral neuropathy: Prolonged peripheral neuropathy can lead to foot ulcers, infections, and potentially life-threatening complications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan as needed to prevent these potential complications and ensure her optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 41 year old female with asthma, DM2, HTN, vertigo,
   depression, CVA, admitted for shortness of breath and chest pain [**12-29**]
   asthma exacerbation who developed hyperglycemia in the setting of
   missing her insulin while in the ED, receiving steroids and her insulin
   underdosed on the floor, transferred to the MICU for insulin gtt.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: [**12-29**] steroids and missed/underdosing of insulin today.
   -insulin gtt
   -NS at 250 until FSG <250 then d51/2
   -q1h fingersticks
   -recheck lytes (though no gap)
   -if no gap develops, hope to transition back to interval dosing of
   insulin as [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs in the AM: U-500 at breakfast, lunch and
   dinner and SSI beginning with 5 units for glu 81-130 and increasing by
   5 units for every 50 mg/dl increase in blood sugar.
   .
   # Shortness of Breath: Likely multifactorial, consistent with previous
   asthma/COPD exacerbations (wheezing, decreased peak flow, improvement
   with nebs and steroids) and patient with notable restrictive component
   to her SBO due to obesity and deconditioning.  [**Month (only) 11**] also have evolving
   pulm htn from OSA and not wearing bipap at home. No signs of PNA (CXR
   unchanged, no cough, fever, white count). CHF unlikely (NL echo [**2149**],
   no edema or JVD, no CXR evidence).  PE remains a possibility given her
   tachy and immobilization and recent initiation of Xolair. D dimer
   checked and was 557, which is similar or less than three prior
   hospitalizations in the past 15 months with similar presentations. Each
   time, D-Dimer obtained, D-Dimer was mildly positive, and pt was ruled
   out for PE by negative V/Q scan, treated for Asthma exacerbation and
   improved. Given this hx, PE is unlikely, but will consider V Q scan if
   patient does not improve tonight.
   -Continue Prednisone 60mg PO daily for presumed COPD exacerbation
   -continue nebs  with Albuterol, Ipratropium
   -continue home inhalers with anti-leukotriene, and Advair
   -Bipap machine
   .
   # Chest Pain: Reproducible with palpation so likely MSK/non-cardiac
   chest pain. Unlikely ACS as no EKG changes, CE negative x 2. GI related
   pain also possible, but unlikely reflux given pt on Omeprazole and
   Ranitidine at home. Could be constipation.
   -one more set CE for ROMI
   -Morphine 15mg PO Q6H PRN pain
   -continue home dose Omeprazole and Ranitidine.
   .
   #Tachycardia: Likely [**12-29**] anxiety, pain and inhalers.  Less likely PE.
   Noted to be tachy to 100-110 range at clinic visits in OMR.
   -IVF, glucose control
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient normotensive on arrival to the ICU.
   -continue home lisinopril
   .
   #Peripheral Neuropathy:
   -continue gabapentin
   -continue Amitriptyline
   -continue lidocaine patch

   steroid injection in Januuary.
   .
   #HLD:
   -continue simvastatin

   # Constipation: Ms. [**Known lastname 1309**] reports 2 days of no BMs. Normally has 2
   BMs/day.
   -continue increased bowel regimen with increased narcotic use.
   -Docusate 200mg PO BID
   -Senna 1 tab [**Hospital1 **] PRN constipation
   .
   #Urinary Rentention: Patient reported urinary retention in the ED so a
   Foley was placed.  Unclear if a bladder scan was done.  U/A negative.
   -continue foley while in ICU
   .
   #OSA: Patient reports haviong CPAP at home though not usually wearing

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, vertigo, depression, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath and chest pain, which is likely multifactorial due to her underlying asthma and COPD exacerbations, obesity, and deconditioning.

The patient has developed hyperglycemia due to missing her insulin while in the emergency department (ED) and receiving steroids and underdosing of insulin on the floor. She is currently on insulin drip and has been titrated to 66U/hour at 20:30, with a goal of getting her sugars under control.

The patient has also developed wheezing and is receiving nebs, prednisone, and magnesium for asthma control. She has a history of intubations and COPD, which may be contributing to her respiratory distress.

The patient's cardiovascular system is stable, with a normal sinus rhythm and no evidence of cardiac ischemia or infarction. However, she has a history of hypertension and is currently normotensive.

The patient's neurological status is also stable, with no signs of increased intracranial pressure or herniation. However, she has a history of peripheral neuropathy and spinal stenosis, which may be contributing to her chronic pain.

The patient's gastrointestinal system is also stable, with no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding or obstruction. However, she has a history of constipation and has been experiencing urinary retention.

The patient's respiratory support is currently focused on maintaining her oxygen saturation above 90% with CPAP and nebs. She is also receiving antibiotics for a possible yeast infection.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Hyperglycemic crisis: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen if her insulin drip is not titrated correctly or if she develops insulin resistance.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen if her asthma and COPD exacerbations are not adequately controlled.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of hypertension and cardiac disease may increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias, particularly if her blood sugar levels become too high or too low.
4. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to her diabetes and corticosteroid therapy may increase her risk of infection.
5. Constipation: The patient's history of constipation may worsen if she becomes immobilized or if her bowel regimen is not adequately managed.
6. Urinary retention: The patient's urinary retention may worsen if her bladder is not regularly emptied or if she develops a urinary tract infection.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is recommended that she continue to receive close monitoring and management in the ICU, with regular assessments of her blood sugar levels, respiratory status, and cardiovascular function."

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical history, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, with an acute exacerbation. They have been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 132/75 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy, but the oxygen saturation is within normal limits at 97%. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute.

The patient has a history of hyperglycemia, and their blood glucose levels have been elevated, with a peak of 163 mg/dL. They are being treated with insulin and other medications to control their blood sugar levels.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 28.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 585 K/uL. Their creatinine levels are elevated, with a peak of 1.0 mg/dL. Their troponin-T levels are normal, but their CK/CKMB levels are elevated.

The patient has a history of allergies to iodine, codeine, Reglan, ketorolac, oxycodone, and peanut, which are being taken into consideration for future medication administration.

The patient's physical examination is notable for right lower extremity edema, which is absent. Their abdominal examination is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present.

The patient's neurological examination is normal, with no signs of altered mental status or neurological deficits.

Based on the patient's condition, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of COPD with acute exacerbation, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Hyperglycemia, which can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic coma.
3. Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression and prolonged hospitalization.
4. Development of pressure ulcers due to immobility and poor perfusion.
5. Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy.
6. Worsening of chronic kidney disease due to prolonged use of nephrotoxic medications.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjusting their treatment plan as needed to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   41 year old female with asthma, DM2, HTN, vertigo, depression, CVA,
   admitted for shortness of breath and chest pain [**12-29**] asthma exacerbation
   who developed hyperglycemia in the setting of missing her insulin while
   in the ED, receiving steroids and her insulin underdosed on the floor,
   transferred to the MICU for insulin gtt and closer blood sugar control
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: [**12-29**] steroids and missed/underdosing of insulin
   previously this admission. Remains with difficult to manage blood
   sugars in MICU.
   -Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs from this morning: Gave NPH fixed dose before
   bed
   -If no gap develops, hope to transition back to regular medicine floor
   - Longstanding OSA likely has resulted in hyperadrenergic state
   hypercortisol levels
 insulin resistance. Encourage strict compliance
   with NPPV, which may aide with blood sugar management
   .
   # Shortness of Breath: Likely multifactorial, consistent with previous
   asthma/COPD exacerbations (wheezing, decreased peak flow, improvement
   with nebs and steroids) and patient with notable restrictive component
   to her SBO due to obesity and deconditioning.  [**Month (only) 11**] also have evolving
   pulm htn from OSA and not wearing bipap at home. No signs of PNA (CXR
   unchanged, no cough, fever, white count). CHF unlikely (NL echo [**2149**],
   no edema or JVD, no CXR evidence).  PE remains a possibility given her
   tachy and immobilization and recent initiation of Xolair. D dimer
   checked and was 557, which is similar or less than three prior
   hospitalizations in the past 15 months with similar presentations. Each
   time, D-Dimer obtained, D-Dimer was mildly positive, and pt was ruled
   out for PE by negative V/Q scan, treated for Asthma exacerbation and
   improved. Given this hx, PE is unlikely, but will consider V Q scan if
   patient does not improve tonight.
   -Continue Prednisone 60mg PO daily for presumed COPD exacerbation (Day
   2 of Pred 60, Day 4 of steroids); will discuss appropriate taper with
   [**Last Name (un) 294**]
   -continue nebs with Albuterol, Ipratropium
   -continue home inhalers with anti-leukotriene, and Advair
   -NPPV overnight, encourage compliance
   .
   # Chest Pain: Reproducible with palpation so likely MSK/non-cardiac
   chest pain. Unlikely ACS as no EKG changes, CE negative x 3. GI related
   pain also possible, but unlikely reflux given pt on Omeprazole and
   Ranitidine at home. Could be constipation. Has resolved in the ICU.
   - Morphine 15mg PO Q6H PRN pain
   - Continue home dose Omeprazole and Ranitidine.
   .
   #Tachycardia: Likely [**12-29**] anxiety, pain and inhalers. Less likely PE.
   Also has baseline tachycardia, 100-110 range at clinic visits in OMR.
   -Glucose control
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient normotensive on arrival to the ICU.
   -continue home lisinopril
   .
   #Peripheral Neuropathy:
   -continue gabapentin
   -continue Amitriptyline
   -continue lidocaine patch
   .
   #Spinal Stenosis:  Seen as outpatient by pain clinic with recent
   steroid injection in Januuary.
   .
   #HLD:
   -continue simvastatin
   .
   #Depression:
   -continue Doxepin
   -SW consult.
   .
   #Vertigo:
   -prn diazepam per outpatient provider
   .
   #GERD:
   -continue ranitidine and omeprazole
   .
   #Urinary Rentention: Patient reported urinary retention in the ED so a
   Foley was placed.  Unclear if a bladder scan was done.  U/A negative.
   -continue foley while in ICU
   .
   #OSA: Patient reports haviong CPAP at home though not usually wearing
   it and had refused it on the floor.
   -autoset CPAP, per respiratory.
   -continue nebs
   .
   # Fxnal Status: Pt wheel chair bound with limited mobility at baseline.

   in the ED, receiving steroids and her insulin underdosed on the floor,
   transferred to the MICU for insulin gtt and closer blood sugar control
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: [**12-29**] steroids and missed/underdosing of insulin

 insulin resistance. Encourage strict compliance
   with NPPV, which may aide with blood sugar management
   .
   # Shortness of Breath: Likely multifactorial, consistent with previous
   asthma/COPD exacerbations (wheezing, decreased peak flow, improvement
   with nebs and steroids) and patient with notable restrictive component
   to her SBO due to obesity and deconditioning.  [**Month (only) 11**] also have evolving
   pulm htn from OSA and not wearing bipap at home. No signs of PNA (CXR
   unchanged, no cough, fever, white count). CHF unlikely (NL echo [**2149**],
   no edema or JVD, no CXR evidence).  PE remains a possibility given her
   tachy and immobilization and recent initiation of Xolair. D dimer
   checked and was 557, which is similar or less than three prior
   hospitalizations in the past 15 months with similar presentations. Each
   time, D-Dimer obtained, D-Dimer was mildly positive, and pt was ruled
   out for PE by negative V/Q scan, treated for Asthma exacerbation and
   improved. Given this hx, PE is unlikely, but will consider V Q scan if

Summary:

The patient is a 41-year-old female admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath and chest pain. She has a history of asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, vertigo, depression, and CVA. She was previously treated for an asthma exacerbation and developed hyperglycemia due to missing her insulin while in the emergency department. She was transferred to the MICU for insulin infusion and closer blood sugar control.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Hyperglycemia: Blood sugars remain difficult to manage in the MICU
* Shortness of breath: Likely multifactorial, consistent with previous asthma/COPD exacerbations and patient's obesity and deconditioning
* Chest pain: Reproducible with palpation, likely non-cardiac
* Tachycardia: Likely anxiety, pain, and inhalers
* Hypertension: Patient normotensive on arrival to the ICU
* Peripheral neuropathy: Patient has a history of peripheral neuropathy and is taking gabapentin, amitriptyline, and lidocaine patch
* Spinal stenosis: Patient has a history of spinal stenosis and received a recent steroid injection in January
* HLD: Patient is taking simvastatin
* Depression: Patient is taking doxepin and has a scheduled SW consult
* Vertigo: Patient reports having vertigo and is taking prn diazepam
* GERD: Patient is taking ranitidine and omeprazole
* Urinary retention: Patient reported urinary retention in the ED and has a Foley catheter in place
* OSA: Patient reports having CPAP at home but does not usually wear it and refused it on the floor

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Hyperglycemia: Can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar non-ketotic syndrome, or acute kidney injury
* Shortness of breath: Can lead to respiratory failure, pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome
* Chest pain: Can lead to cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias
* Tachycardia: Can lead to cardiac complications, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia
* Hypertension: Can lead to cardiac complications, such as hypertensive crisis or acute kidney injury
* Peripheral neuropathy: Can lead to foot ulcers, Charcot foot, or autonomic dysfunction
* Spinal stenosis: Can lead to spinal cord compression, radiculopathy, or cauda equina syndrome
* HLD: Can lead to cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke
* Depression: Can lead to suicidal ideation, self-harm, or worsening of symptoms
* Vertigo: Can lead to falls, head injuries, or worsening of symptoms
* GERD: Can lead to esophageal stricture, Barrett's esophagus, or esophageal cancer
* Urinary retention: Can lead to urinary tract infections, bladder stones, or chronic kidney disease
* OSA: Can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac complications, or sudden death"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   41 year old female with asthma, DM2, HTN, vertigo, depression, CVA,
   admitted for shortness of breath and chest pain [**12-29**] asthma exacerbation
   who developed hyperglycemia in the setting of missing her insulin while
   in the ED, receiving steroids and her insulin underdosed on the floor,
   transferred to the MICU for insulin gtt and closer blood sugar control
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: [**12-29**] steroids and missed/underdosing of insulin
   previously this admission. Significantly improved
   -Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs from this morning: Gave NPH fixed dose before
   bed
   -Transition back to regular medicine floor
   - Longstanding OSA likely has resulted in hyperadrenergic state
   hypercortisol levels
 insulin resistance. Encourage strict compliance
   with NPPV, which may aide with blood sugar management
   .
   # Shortness of Breath: Likely multifactorial, consistent with previous
   asthma/COPD exacerbations (wheezing, decreased peak flow, improvement
   with nebs and steroids) and patient with notable restrictive component
   to her SBO due to obesity and deconditioning.
   -Discuss further steroid taper with [**Last Name (un) 294**] to coordinate insulin
   regimen
   -continue nebs with Albuterol, Ipratropium
   -continue home inhalers with anti-leukotriene, and Advair
   -NPPV overnight, encourage compliance
   .
   # Chest Pain: Resolved
   - Continue home dose Omeprazole and Ranitidine.
   .
   #Tachycardia: Likely [**12-29**] anxiety, pain and inhalers. Less likely PE.
   Also has baseline tachycardia, 100-110 range at clinic visits in OMR.
   -Glucose control
   .
   # Vulvovaginal itch: c/w topical treatment
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient normotensive on arrival to the ICU.
   -continue home lisinopril
   .
   #Peripheral Neuropathy: continue gabapentin, Amitriptyline, lidocaine
   patch
   .
   #Spinal Stenosis:  Seen as outpatient by pain clinic with recent
   steroid injection in Januuary.

   #HLD: continue simvastatin
   .
   #Depression: continue Doxepin
   .
   #Vertigo: prn diazepam per outpatient provider
   .
   #GERD: continue ranitidine and omeprazole
   .
   #Urinary Rentention: continue foley while in ICU
   .
   #OSA: Patient reports haviong CPAP at home though not usually wearing
   it and had refused it on the floor.
   -autoset CPAP, per respiratory.
   -continue nebs
   .
   # Fxnal Status: Pt wheel chair bound with limited mobility at baseline.
   -PT consult

Summary:

The patient is a 41-year-old female with a complex medical history, including asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, vertigo, depression, and a history of cerebral vascular accident (CVA). She was admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath and chest pain, which were likely related to an asthma exacerbation. She has been experiencing hyperglycemia due to missing her insulin and receiving steroids, which has been managed with insulin gtt and closer blood sugar control. The patient also has a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which may be contributing to her hyperadrenergic state and insulin resistance.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 132/75 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She has been receiving insulin gtt, heparin, and other medications, and has been monitored for fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is likely to continue unless her insulin regimen is adjusted and she is able to maintain good glucose control.
2. Asthma exacerbation: The patient's asthma exacerbation is likely to continue unless her treatment is adjusted and she is able to manage her symptoms effectively.
3. OSA: The patient's OSA may be contributing to her hyperadrenergic state and insulin resistance, and may require further treatment, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may be related to her diabetes and may require further treatment, such as medication or lifestyle changes.
5. Peripheral neuropathy: The patient's peripheral neuropathy may be related to her diabetes and may require further treatment, such as pain management or physical therapy.
6. Spinal stenosis: The patient's spinal stenosis may be contributing to her limited mobility and may require further treatment, such as physical therapy or surgery.
7. Depression: The patient's depression may be related to her medical conditions and may require further treatment, such as therapy or medication.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical conditions to prevent complications and improve her quality of life."
