   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
   1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Patient with likely upper GIB probably
   from ASA use +/- stopping PPI causing ulceration or
   gastritis/duodenitis.  Given intrathoracic stomach volvulus is on
   differential though extremely unlikely given patient is overall
   non-toxic.
   - Speak to GI re: timing of endoscopy
   - Continue IV PPI drip
   -Two peripheral IV
s, active type and cross
   -Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea
   -Transfuse for Hct <22 or Hct drop of > 3 in six hours
   2)  Leukocytosis:  The patient has a history of elevated WBC counts and
   has had partial evals for myeloid process in the past.  Potentially due
   to cat bite/infection as well as UTI with vomiting and other reasons
   for elevated WBC count though this still seems quite high.  No abnormal
   or left shifted forms suggesting failure of myeloid differentiation.
   -treat cat bite per below
   -trend leukocytosis and fever curve, repeat diff in AM
   3.) EKG changes:  These are improved on repeat ECG, which seems
   consistent with resolution of demand ischemia as tachycardia and anemia
   were treated.  Patient now with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
   -Repeat ECG
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills to me but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites will initiate empiric
   treatment with ampicillin-sublactam.
   -Amp sublactam 3gm IV Q6hr
    5.)  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.  Cr
   falling after hydration.
   -Continue to follow.
   6) Probable UTI: Probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
   esterase.
   -UTI most likely E coli given nitrites which should be covered by
   amp-sublactam, no further abx at this time but will f/u cx
   -Patient with known temporary stent that has not been removed, will d/w
   urology
   7)  Goiter on R side of neck: This is a chronic problem.
   -TSH WNL and T4 pending
   -arrange o/p endocrine f/u
   8) Social: Pt lives alone and reports trouble getting to MD [**Last Name (Titles) 5915**]
   (though cat sees vet 2*/yr) Will get SW involved to find resources for
   this very pleasant lady.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, depression, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) who was admitted to the ICU for upper GIB assessment. She presented with coffee ground emesis and was found to have a hematocrit (Hct) of 31.9, which decreased to 25 after receiving 2L of normal saline. She received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and was started on a pantoprazole drip. The patient has a history of elevated white blood cell (WBC) counts and has had partial evaluations for a myeloid process in the past. She has also been diagnosed with a probable urinary tract infection (UTI) and is being treated with ampicillin-sublactam.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Upper GIB bleeding: The patient's bleeding is likely due to the use of aspirin and/or the cessation of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, which may have caused ulceration or gastritis/duodenitis. The patient is at risk for further bleeding, especially if the PPI drip is discontinued.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, which may be due to a variety of factors, including a myeloid process, cat bite/infection, or UTI. The patient is at risk for developing sepsis or other complications related to leukocytosis.
3. EKG changes: The patient's EKG changes are likely due to demand ischemia, which was treated with fluids and blood. However, the patient's cardiac enzymes are still elevated, and she is at risk for developing cardiac complications.
4. Cat bite infection: The patient has a high risk of developing an infection from the cat bite, which may be treated with antibiotics.
5. UTI: The patient's UTI is likely caused by E. coli, which should be covered by the ampicillin-sublactam antibiotic therapy. However, the patient may still develop complications related to the UTI, such as sepsis or kidney damage.
6. Dehydration: The patient is at risk for dehydration due to her ongoing bleeding and may require further fluid resuscitation.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she may still develop complications related to her underlying medical conditions, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications, including upper GIB bleeding, leukocytosis, EKG changes, cat bite infection, UTI, dehydration, and respiratory complications. It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment accordingly to prevent or minimize these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
   1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Patient with likely upper GIB probably
   from ASA use.  , gastric volvulus on differential, nsaid-induced
   ulcerations.  Admitted to [**2184**] with sepsis, noted to have GIB with
   coffee ground fluid from NGT, noted to have large hiatal hernia with
   resultant intrathoracic stomach, ?predispose to UGIB and gastritis,
   hpylori(-) at that time.
   - as per GI recommendations, surgery consult given concern for gastric
   volvulus
   - GI consult, addressing need for upper GI scope
   -PPI drip
   -IV's *2
   -Ondansetron PRN for nausea
    2. leukocytosis: of note has elevated white count on admit, has had
   leukocytosis in past, notes suggest past evaluation by hematopath,
   thought c/w inflammatory response.  Possible c/w infected cat bite
   though smoldering chronic process leading to leukocytosis is not
   clearly ruled out.  No abnormal or left shifted forms suggesting
   myeloid process.
   -treat cat bite per below
   -monitor
    3. EKG changes: Given flat CE's and other transaminases as well as
   diffuse and nonspecific pattern it is unlikely this is due to acute
   MI.  Would be concerned about demand ischemia.
   -Cycle CE's
   -Repeat ECG
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills to me but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites will initiate empiric
   treatment with ampicillin-sublactam.
   -Amp sublactam 3gm IV Q6hr
    5.  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.
   -Check UA
   -1 L NS
   -Will recheck lytes this PM with next Hct.
    6.  Goiter on R side of neck: This is a chronic problem.
   -Check TSH and free T4

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, depression, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) who presented with hematemesis and was admitted to the ICU for upper GIB assessment. She has a large hiatal hernia and a history of ASA use, which may have contributed to her GIB. The patient has been treated with pantoprazole drip and has undergone a nasogastric tube (NGT) placement.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed (UGIB): The patient's GIB is likely due to ASA use, and there is a risk of further bleeding or complications such as gastric volvulus.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been treated for sepsis, and there is a risk of developing septic shock or multi-organ failure.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white count may be due to an inflammatory response or an underlying myeloid process, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
4. EKG Changes: The patient's EKG changes may be due to demand ischemia, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
5. Cat Bite Infection: The patient has a cat bite wound, and there is a risk of developing an infection, which may require further treatment.
6. Renal Complications: The patient's creatinine elevation may be due to dehydration or prerenal azotemia, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of developing pneumonia, particularly given her age and underlying medical conditions.
8. DVT: The patient is at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to her immobility and underlying medical conditions.
9. Stress Ulcer: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcer due to her GIB and underlying medical conditions.

Recommendations:

1. Continue pantoprazole drip and monitor the patient's GIB.
2. Monitor the patient's leukocytosis and consider further evaluation to determine the cause.
3. Continue EKG monitoring and consider further evaluation to determine the cause of the patient's EKG changes.
4. Monitor the patient's cat bite wound and consider further treatment if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider further evaluation to determine the cause of the creatinine elevation.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider further evaluation if necessary.
7. Consider prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust treatment as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB). The patient has a history of cat bite, and the bleeding is presumed to be Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB) due to gastritis or Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD) in the setting of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) use.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 89 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 111/47 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 93%. The patient's respiratory support includes an ABG reading of pH 7.26.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a thin build, normal cardiovascular examination, and clear breath sounds. The patient's abdominal examination is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. The patient's extremities are absent, with cyanosis noted. The patient's skin is warm, and the neurologic examination is normal.

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 27.7 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 461 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypernatremia and hyperkalemia.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Bleeding: The patient is at risk of continued bleeding due to UGIB, which may lead to hypovolemic shock and organ dysfunction.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of cat bite and is at risk of developing cellulitis or other infections.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and organs.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypernatremia and hyperkalemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support may be inadequate, leading to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia may be a sign of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
7. Malignancy: The patient's RUL mass may be a sign of malignancy, which may require further evaluation and treatment.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued oxygen therapy and respiratory support
2. Blood transfusions to address anemia and bleeding
3. Antibiotics to cover usual cat bite pathogens
4. Serial hemoglobin checks to monitor anemia
5. Large-bore IV access to ensure adequate fluid resuscitation
6. GI follow-up to evaluate for endoscopy
7. Social services consult to address the patient's social and emotional needs
8. Repeat CT scan to evaluate the size and nature of the RUL mass
9. Possible thoracic consult to evaluate the patient's respiratory and cardiac status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of coffee ground emesis. The patient has a history of cat bite injury, NSAID use, and has been receiving antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, and blood pressure of 111/47 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen and an ABG reading of pH 7.26. The patient's physical examination reveals a thin individual with a soft and non-tender abdomen, no cyanosis, and a warm skin tone. The patient's neurologic examination is normal, with orientation to person, place, and time.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 27.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 461 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypernatremia and hypokalemia. The patient's coagulation profile is normal, with a PT of 13.9 seconds, PTT of 24.0 seconds, and INR of 1.2.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's hemoglobin level is decreasing, and the patient has a history of NSAID use, which may have contributed to the bleeding.
2. Cat bite: The patient has a cellulitis at the site of the cat bite, and the patient is receiving antibiotics to cover usual cat bite pathogens.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be due to cellulitis or a urinary tract infection.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is decreasing, which may be due to gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated, which may be due to dehydration or excessive sodium administration.
6. RUL mass: The patient has a mass in the right upper lobe of the lung, which may be a goiter, malignancy, or other condition.
7. EKG changes: The patient's EKG shows changes, which may be due to electrolyte imbalances or other cardiac conditions.

Potential medical complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's bleeding may worsen, leading to hypovolemic shock, acidosis, and coagulopathy.
2. Infection: The patient's cellulitis and leukocytosis may worsen, leading to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support may not be sufficient, leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's EKG changes may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output.
5. Renal failure: The patient's electrolyte imbalances and decreased cardiac output may lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological examination is normal, but the patient may develop neurological complications, such as seizures or cerebral edema, due to electrolyte imbalances or other conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
   1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Patient with likely upper GIB probably
   from ASA use +/- stopping PPI causing ulceration or
   gastritis/duodenitis.  Chest CT [**3-5**] ruled out volvulus but showed
   unchanged hiatal hernia.
   - EGD per GI today
   - Continue IV PPI drip
   -Two peripheral IV
s, active type and cross
   -Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea
   -Transfuse for Hct <25 or Hct drop of > 3 in six hours, Check Hct Q 6
   hrs
   2)  Leukocytosis:  The patient has a history of elevated WBC counts and
   has had partial evals for myeloid process in the past.  Potentially due
   to cat bite/infection as well as UTI with vomiting and other reasons
   for elevated WBC count though this still seems quite high.  No abnormal
   or left shifted forms suggesting failure of myeloid differentiation.
   -treat cat bite per below
   -trend leukocytosis and fever curve, repeat diff in AM
   3.) EKG changes:  These are improved on repeat ECG, which seems
   consistent with resolution of demand ischemia as tachycardia and anemia
   were treated.  Patient now with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
   -will monitor for any cardiac sx
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills in ICU but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites empirically treating with
   ampicillin-sublactam. Today, area of bite is fluctuant. Pt has
   consented to drainage of abscess
   -needle drainage of abscess after EGD with pt sedated today
    5.)  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.  Cr
   now down to 0.8.
   -Continue to follow.
   6) Probable UTI: Probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
   esterase.
   -UTI most likely E coli given nitrites which should be covered by
   amp-sublactam, no further abx at this time but will f/u cx
   -Patient with known temporary stent that has not been removed- per
   urology ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) wanted KUB this am. Now would like CT non
   contrast abd and pelvis to look for hydro and stent placement. Will
   discuss this with pt today.
   7)  Goiter on R side of neck: TSH and T4  WNL  this admission. Goiter
   slightly larger on CT Chest [**3-5**]
   -arrange o/p endocrine f/u
   8) Social: Pt lives alone and reports trouble getting to MD [**Last Name (Titles) 5915**]
   (though cat sees vet 2*/yr) Will get SW involved to find resources for
   this very pleasant lady.  She seems to have trouble with transportation
   and will talk to social work about this.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
   1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Patient with likely upper GIB probably
   from ASA use +/- stopping PPI causing ulceration or
   gastritis/duodenitis.  Chest CT [**3-5**] ruled out volvulus but showed
   unchanged hiatal hernia.
   - EGD per GI today
   - Continue IV PPI drip
   -Two peripheral IV
s, active type and cross
   -Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea
   -Transfuse for Hct <25 or Hct drop of > 3 in six hours, Check Hct Q 6
   hrs
   2)  Leukocytosis:  The patient has a history of elevated WBC counts and
   has had partial evals for myeloid process in the past.  Potentially due
   to cat bite/infection as well as UTI with vomiting and other reasons
   for elevated WBC count though this still seems quite high.  No abnormal
   or left shifted forms suggesting failure of myeloid differentiation.
   -treat cat bite per below
   -trend leukocytosis and fever curve, repeat diff in AM
   3.) EKG changes:  These are improved on repeat ECG, which seems
   consistent with resolution of demand ischemia as tachycardia and anemia
   were treated.  Patient now with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
   -will monitor for any cardiac sx
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills in ICU but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites empirically treating with
   ampicillin-sublactam. Today, area of bite is fluctuant. Pt has
   consented to drainage of abscess
   -needle drainage of abscess after EGD with pt sedated today
    5.)  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.  Cr
   now down to 0.8.
   -Continue to follow.
   6) Probable UTI: Probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
   esterase.
   -UTI most likely E coli given nitrites which should be covered by
   amp-sublactam, no further abx at this time but will f/u cx
   -Patient with known temporary stent that has not been removed- per
   urology ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) wanted KUB this am. Now would like CT non
   contrast abd and pelvis to look for hydro and stent placement. Will
   discuss this with pt today.
   7)  Goiter on R side of neck: TSH and T4  WNL  this admission. Goiter
   slightly larger on CT Chest [**3-5**]
   -arrange o/p endocrine f/u
   8) Social: Pt lives alone and reports trouble getting to MD [**Last Name (Titles) 5915**]
   (though cat sees vet 2*/yr) Will get SW involved to find resources for
   this very pleasant lady.  She seems to have trouble with transportation
   and will talk to social work about this.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, depression, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) who was admitted to the ICU for upper GIB assessment. She presented with one day of hematemesis and was found to have a likely upper GIB caused by aspirin use and/or stopping proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. The patient has a history of elevated white blood cell counts and has had partial evaluations for a myeloid process in the past. She also has a cat bite infection and is being treated with ampicillin-sublactam.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 27.7 x 10^9/L
* Elevated creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL
* Elevated potassium of 5.7 mmol/L
* Elevated magnesium of 1.8 mmol/L
* Elevated phosphorus of 2.0 mmol/L
* Elevated troponin-T of 53 ng/mL
* Elevated CK-MB of 4%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Mild nausea
* Substernal burning pain
* Soft and non-tender abdomen
* No cyanosis or rash
* Warm and dry skin
* Normal tone and movement

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* Heart rate: 73 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 106/40 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's GIB may continue to bleed, leading to hypovolemic shock, respiratory failure, or cardiac arrest.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate a underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis, organ failure, or death.
3. Cat bite infection: The patient's cat bite infection may progress to abscess formation, cellulitis, or sepsis.
4. Urinary tract infection: The patient's probable UTI may lead to sepsis, pyelonephritis, or kidney failure.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's elevated potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or respiratory failure.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin-T and CK-MB levels may indicate myocardial infarction or cardiac failure, which could lead to cardiac arrest or death.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's mild nausea and substernal burning pain may indicate respiratory failure, which could lead to respiratory arrest or death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Administer antibiotics and antacids as prescribed.
3. Perform a gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD) to evaluate the patient's upper gastrointestinal tract.
4. Continue to treat the patient's cat bite infection with ampicillin-sublactam.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Consider consulting with a cardiologist to evaluate the patient's cardiac status.
7. Consider consulting with a nephrologist to evaluate the patient's kidney function."

   Assessment and Plan
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
   1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Patient with likely upper GIB probably
   from ASA use +/- stopping PPI causing ulceration or
   gastritis/duodenitis.  Given intrathoracic stomach volvulus is on
   differential though extremely unlikely given patient is overall
   non-toxic.
   - Speak to GI re: timing of endoscopy
   - Continue IV PPI drip
   -Two peripheral IV
s, active type and cross
   -Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea
   -Transfuse for Hct <22 or Hct drop of > 3 in six hours
   2)  Leukocytosis:  The patient has a history of elevated WBC counts and
   has had partial evals for myeloid process in the past.  Potentially due
   to cat bite/infection as well as UTI with vomiting and other reasons
   for elevated WBC count though this still seems quite high.  No abnormal
   or left shifted forms suggesting failure of myeloid differentiation.
   -treat cat bite per below
   -trend leukocytosis and fever curve, repeat diff in AM
   3.) EKG changes:  These are improved on repeat ECG, which seems
   consistent with resolution of demand ischemia as tachycardia and anemia
   were treated.  Patient now with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
   -Repeat ECG
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills to me but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites will initiate empiric
   treatment with ampicillin-sublactam.
   -Amp sublactam 3gm IV Q6hr
    5.)  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.  Cr
   falling after hydration.
   -Continue to follow.
   6) Probable UTI: Probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
   esterase.
   -UTI most likely E coli given nitrites which should be covered by
   amp-sublactam, no further abx at this time but will f/u cx
   -Patient with known temporary stent that has not been removed, will d/w
   urology
   7)  Goiter on R side of neck: This is a chronic problem.
   -TSH WNL and T4 pending
   -arrange o/p endocrine f/u
   8) Social: Pt lives alone and reports trouble getting to MD [**Last Name (Titles) 5915**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, depression, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) who presented with one day of hematemesis in the context of extensive ASA use. The patient was admitted to the ICU for upper GIB assessment.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has likely upper GIB, possibly due to ASA use and/or stopping PPI causing ulceration or gastritis/duodenitis. The patient is receiving IV PPI drip, and a discussion with GI regarding the timing of endoscopy is planned.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has a history of elevated WBC counts and has had partial evaluations for myeloid process in the past. The patient's leukocytosis is potentially due to cat bite/infection, UTI, and other reasons. No abnormal or left-shifted forms suggesting failure of myeloid differentiation are present.
3. EKG Changes: The patient's EKG changes are improved on repeat ECG, suggesting resolution of demand ischemia with treatment of tachycardia and anemia. Two sets of negative cardiac enzymes are present.
4. Cat Bite: The patient has a cat bite infection, and empiric treatment with ampicillin-sublactam is initiated.
5. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's creatinine elevation is likely due to dehydration/prerenal, and Cr is falling after hydration.
6. Probable Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte esterase. The UTI is likely due to E. coli, which is covered by amp-sublactam.
7. Goiter: The patient has a chronic goiter on the right side of the neck, which is a chronic problem. TSH is within normal limits, and T4 is pending. Arrangements are being made for outpatient endocrine follow-up.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Continued bleeding can lead to hypovolemic shock, organ failure, and increased risk of aspiration pneumonia.
2. Leukocytosis: Uncontrolled leukocytosis can lead to increased risk of infection, sepsis, and organ dysfunction.
3. EKG changes: Unstable EKG changes can indicate cardiac ischemia or infarction, leading to cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
4. Cat bite infection: Uncontrolled infection can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and increased risk of secondary infections.
5. Chronic kidney disease: Continued kidney dysfunction can lead to end-stage renal disease, increased risk of infections, and electrolyte imbalances.
6. UTI: Uncontrolled UTI can lead to sepsis, pyelonephritis, and increased risk of secondary infections.
7. Goiter: Uncontrolled goiter can lead to compression of surrounding structures, including the trachea, esophagus, and nerves, leading to respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological complications.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening conditions, and interventions should be implemented promptly to address any complications that arise."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and gastrointestinal bleeding (upper). They are currently in the ICU and have been receiving antibiotics and other medications to manage their conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/40 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy and have a SpO2 of 94%. The patient's respiratory support is minimal, with no invasive ventilation. Their laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. The patient's physical examination reveals a thin and anxious appearance, with mild abdominal tenderness and absent peripheral pulses.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's UTI and gastrointestinal bleeding increase their risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's upper gastrointestinal bleeding may continue to bleed, leading to hypovolemic shock and organ failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate potential kidney damage, which can lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's decreased platelet count increases their risk of bleeding complications, including intracranial hemorrhage.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is minimal, and they may require invasive ventilation if their oxygenation and ventilation status deteriorate.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may indicate cardiovascular instability, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.
7. Infection: The patient's UTI and gastrointestinal bleeding increase their risk of developing secondary infections, which can worsen their condition.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is unknown, and they may require nutritional support to prevent malnutrition and associated complications."

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) and a history of taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) after a cat bite. The patient has a presumptive diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) due to gastritis or peptic ulcer disease (PUD) in the setting of NSAID use and a cat bite.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.4°C (99.4°F)
* Heart rate: 73 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 106/40 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%

The patient has a history of a cat bite, which has developed into an infected site with leukocytosis and redness/cellulitis. The patient is also experiencing a goiter, which is being evaluated with a repeat CT scan.

The patient has received transfusions of packed red blood cells (pRBC) and has a decreased hemoglobin level. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.3 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 27.7 K/uL
* Platelet count: 461
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 97 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.0 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Repeat transfusions of pRBC
* Administration of proton pump inhibitors (PPI)
* Evaluation for endoscopy
* Drainage of the infected cat bite site
* Repeat CT scan to evaluate the goiter
* Consultation with a urologist for the placement of ureteral stents
* Broadening of the coverage for urinary tract infection (UTI)

The patient is critically ill and is at risk for developing various medical complications, including:

* Respiratory failure due to the patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation
* Cardiac arrest due to the patient's tachycardia and hypotension
* Sepsis due to the patient's infected cat bite site and UTI
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's presumptive diagnosis of UGIB
* Kidney injury due to the patient's decreased hemoglobin level and electrolyte imbalance
* Neurological compromise due to the patient's decreased oxygen saturation and potential for hypotension"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to a presumed upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) and a cat bite infection. She has a history of goiter and ureteral stents, which were recently placed. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/40 mmHg. Her respiratory status is also stable, with an oxygen saturation of 94% and a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show a decrease in hemoglobin level, with a value of 8.3 g/dL. Her white blood cell count is elevated, with a value of 27.7 K/uL. Her platelet count is within normal limits, with a value of 461. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, with values of 26 mEq/L and 143 mg/dL, respectively.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin and anxious appearance. Her abdomen is soft and bowel sounds are present, but she has mild tenderness. Her extremities are absent, and her skin is not assessed.

Potential medical complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's UGIB may worsen, leading to further bleeding, shock, and organ failure.
2. Infection: The patient's cat bite infection may spread, leading to abscess formation, sepsis, and organ failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, and death.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels may indicate acute kidney injury (AKI), which may progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not managed promptly.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's decreased blood pressure may indicate cardiovascular instability, which may worsen if not managed promptly.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's absent extremities and unassessed skin may indicate neurological complications, such as peripheral neuropathy or skin breakdown.
7. Endocrine complications: The patient's goiter may worsen, leading to thyroid storm or hypothyroidism if not managed promptly.
8. Urological complications: The patient's ureteral stents may cause urinary tract infections (UTIs), which may worsen if not managed promptly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to a cat bite and presented with coffee ground emesis. She has a history of gastritis and PUD, and is taking NSAIDs, which may have contributed to her current condition.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 106/40 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 30 inspirations per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 94% on room air.

The patient has a number of medical conditions, including a cat bite infection, gastritis, and PUD. She has also been diagnosed with a goiter and has ureteral stents in place.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 27.7, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 461. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient is currently receiving antibiotics for her cat bite infection and has been started on a proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcer prophylaxis. She is also receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers.

The patient's plan includes repeat packed red blood cell transfusions, further evaluation for endoscopy, and possible consultation with thoracic, endocrine, or interventional pulmonary medicine. She is also scheduled for a repeat CT scan to evaluate her goiter and possible ureteral stents.

The patient's disposition is critical, with a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status."

   Imaging: CT Abdomen and Pelvis:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. New left hydronephrosis. There is also slight downward displacement
   of
   the proximal pigtail portion of the right NU stent, with the pigtail
   now
   coiled within the renal pelvis rather than in upper pole calix as
   before.
   Multiple bilateral renal calculi are again demonstrated. A few 2-3 mm
   calculi
   are seen adjacent to the right NU stent, in the mid-distal portion of
   the
   ureter in the pelvis.
   2. The bladder is distended, and there is a focus of gas within the
   bladder,
   possibly related to instrumentation. Please correlate.
   3. Extensive colonic diverticulosis.
   4. Probable cholelithiasis.
   5. Small bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.
   6. Intrathoracic stomach.

   Assessment and Plan
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
    1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Patient with likely upper GIB probably
   from ASA use +/- stopping PPI causing ulceration or
   gastritis/duodenitis.  Chest CT [**3-5**] ruled out volvulus but showed
   unchanged hiatal hernia.
   - EGD per GI today
   - Continue IV PPI drip
   -Two peripheral IV
s, active type and cross
   -Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea
   -Transfuse for Hct <25 or Hct drop of > 3 in six hours, Check Hct Q 6
   hrs
    2)  Leukocytosis:  The patient has a history of elevated WBC counts
   and has had partial evals for myeloid process in the past.  Potentially
   due to cat bite/infection as well as UTI with vomiting and other
   reasons for elevated WBC count though this still seems quite high.  No
   abnormal or left shifted forms suggesting failure of myeloid
   differentiation.
   -treat cat bite per below
   -trend leukocytosis and fever curve, repeat diff in AM
    3.) EKG changes:  These are improved on repeat ECG, which seems
   consistent with resolution of demand ischemia as tachycardia and anemia
   were treated.  Patient now with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
   -will monitor for any cardiac sx
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills in ICU but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites empirically treating with
   ampicillin-sublactam. Today, area of bite is fluctuant. Pt has
   consented to drainage of abscess
   -needle drainage of abscess after EGD with pt sedated today
    5.)  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.  Cr
   now down to 0.8.
   -Continue to follow.
    6) Probable UTI: Probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
   esterase.
   -UTI most likely E coli given nitrites which should be covered by
   amp-sublactam, no further abx at this time but will f/u cx
   -Patient with known temporary stent that has not been removed- per
   urology ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) wanted KUB this am. Now would like CT non
   contrast abd and pelvis to look for hydro and stent placement. Will
   discuss this with pt today.
    7)  Goiter on R side of neck: TSH and T4  WNL  this admission. Goiter
   slightly larger on CT Chest [**3-5**]
   -arrange o/p endocrine f/u
    8) Social: Pt lives alone and reports trouble getting to MD [**Last Name (Titles) 5915**]
   (though cat sees vet 2*/yr) Will get SW involved to find resources for
   this very pleasant lady.  She seems to have trouble with transportation
   and will talk to social work about this.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
    1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Patient with likely upper GIB probably
   from ASA use +/- stopping PPI causing ulceration or
   gastritis/duodenitis.  Chest CT [**3-5**] ruled out volvulus but showed
   unchanged hiatal hernia.
   - EGD per GI today
   - Continue IV PPI drip
   -Two peripheral IV
s, active type and cross
   -Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea
   -Transfuse for Hct <25 or Hct drop of > 3 in six hours, Check Hct Q 6
   hrs
    2)  Leukocytosis:  The patient has a history of elevated WBC counts
   and has had partial evals for myeloid process in the past.  Potentially
   due to cat bite/infection as well as UTI with vomiting and other
   reasons for elevated WBC count though this still seems quite high.  No
   abnormal or left shifted forms suggesting failure of myeloid
   differentiation.
   -treat cat bite per below
   -trend leukocytosis and fever curve, repeat diff in AM
    3.) EKG changes:  These are improved on repeat ECG, which seems
   consistent with resolution of demand ischemia as tachycardia and anemia
   were treated.  Patient now with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
   -will monitor for any cardiac sx
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills in ICU but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites empirically treating with
   ampicillin-sublactam. Today, area of bite is fluctuant. Pt has
   consented to drainage of abscess
   -needle drainage of abscess after EGD with pt sedated today
    5.)  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.  Cr
   now down to 0.8.
   -Continue to follow.
    6) Probable UTI: Probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
   esterase.
   -UTI most likely E coli given nitrites which should be covered by
   amp-sublactam, no further abx at this time but will f/u cx
   -Patient with known temporary stent that has not been removed- per
   urology ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) wanted KUB this am. Now would like CT non
   contrast abd and pelvis to look for hydro and stent placement. Will
   discuss this with pt today.
    7)  Goiter on R side of neck: TSH and T4  WNL  this admission. Goiter
   slightly larger on CT Chest [**3-5**]
   -arrange o/p endocrine f/u
    8) Social: Pt lives alone and reports trouble getting to MD [**Last Name (Titles) 5915**]
   (though cat sees vet 2*/yr) Will get SW involved to find resources for
   this very pleasant lady.  She seems to have trouble with transportation
   and will talk to social work about this.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female admitted to the ICU for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with a history of hypertension, depression, and GIB. She presented with one day of hematemesis and was found to have multiple ulcerations in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum during endoscopy. She has a cat bite lesion on her right hand, which is fluctuant and requires drainage. The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and a probable upper respiratory tract infection. She has a history of elevated white blood cell counts and has had partial evaluations for myeloid process in the past.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase. Her kidney function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL. She has a history of hypertension and is taking antihypertensive medications.

The patient's imaging studies show bilateral renal calculi, new right hydronephrosis, and a slight downward displacement of the proximal pigtail portion of the right nephrostomy tube. She also has a distended bladder and a focus of gas within the bladder, possibly related to instrumentation.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Continue IV proton pump inhibitor drip, two peripheral IV lines, and transfusion for hematocrit <25 or a drop of >3 in six hours.
2. Leukocytosis: Trend leukocytosis and fever curve, repeat differential count in the morning.
3. EKG changes: Monitor for any cardiac symptoms.
4. Cat bite: Empirically treat with ampicillin-sublactam, and drain the abscess after endoscopy.
5. Kidney function: Continue to follow.
6. UTI: Probable UTI, given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte esterase. Cover with amp-sublactam, and follow up with urine culture.
7. Goiter: Arrange outpatient endocrine follow-up.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Continued bleeding, hemorrhagic shock, and death.
2. Leukocytosis: Leukopenia, neutropenia, and increased risk of infection.
3. EKG changes: Cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrest.
4. Cat bite infection: Sepsis, abscess formation, and necrotizing fasciitis.
5. UTI: Pyelonephritis, sepsis, and kidney damage.
6. Kidney function impairment: Acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease.
7. Goiter: Thyrotoxic crisis, hypothyroidism, and thyroid storm.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
   1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Due to multiple ulcerations in the context
   - EGD per GI today
   - Continue IV PPI drip
   -Two peripheral IV
s, active type and cross
   -Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea
   -Transfuse for Hct <25 or Hct drop of > 3 in six hours, Check Hct Q 6
   hrs
    2)  Leukocytosis:  The patient has a history of elevated WBC counts
   and has had partial evals for myeloid process in the past.  Potentially
   due to cat bite/infection as well as UTI with vomiting and other
   reasons for elevated WBC count though this still seems quite high.  No
   abnormal or left shifted forms suggesting failure of myeloid
   differentiation.
   -treat cat bite per below
   -trend leukocytosis and fever curve, repeat diff in AM
    3.) EKG changes:  These are improved on repeat ECG, which seems
   consistent with resolution of demand ischemia as tachycardia and anemia
   were treated.  Patient now with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
   -will monitor for any cardiac sx
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills in ICU but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites empirically treating with
   ampicillin-sublactam. Today, area of bite is fluctuant. Pt has
   consented to drainage of abscess
   -needle drainage of abscess after EGD with pt sedated today
    5.)  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.  Cr
   now down to 0.8.
   -Continue to follow.
    6) Probable UTI: Probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
   esterase.
   -UTI most likely E coli given nitrites which should be covered by
   amp-sublactam, no further abx at this time but will f/u cx
   -Patient with known temporary stent that has not been removed- per
   urology ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) wanted KUB this am. Now would like CT non
   contrast abd and pelvis to look for hydro and stent placement. Will
   discuss this with pt today.
    7)  Goiter on R side of neck: TSH and T4  WNL  this admission. Goiter
   slightly larger on CT Chest [**3-5**]
   -arrange o/p endocrine f/u
    8) Social: Pt lives alone and reports trouble getting to MD [**Last Name (Titles) 5915**]
   (though cat sees vet 2*/yr) Will get SW involved to find resources for
   this very pleasant lady.  She seems to have trouble with transportation
   and will talk to social work about this.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, depression, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) who was admitted to the ICU for upper GIB assessment. The patient presented with one day of hematemesis and was found to have multiple ulcerations in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum during an endoscopy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 63 beats per minute, blood pressure of 106/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's respiratory support is minimal, with no oxygen delivery device in use.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.7 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 31.8%
* Platelet count: 461,000/μL
* White blood cell count: 27.7 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 91 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Within normal limits

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CT abdomen and pelvis: Bilateral renal calculi, new right hydronephrosis, and a few 2-3 mm calculi adjacent to the right ureteral stent.
* CT chest: Slight displacement of the proximal pigtail portion of the right ureteral stent, with the pigtail now coiled within the renal pelvis.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Due to multiple ulcerations in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has a history of elevated white blood cell counts and has had partial evaluations for myeloid process in the past. The patient's current WBC count is 27.7 x 10^9/L, which is still elevated.
3. EKG changes: The patient's EKG showed changes consistent with demand ischemia, which have improved with treatment.
4. Cat bite: The patient has a fluctuant area of bite, which may require drainage.
5. Probable UTI: The patient's urinalysis shows pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte esterase, which are consistent with a urinary tract infection.
6. Dehydration: The patient's creatinine level has decreased from 1.2 to 0.8 mg/dL, which suggests that the patient is dehydrated.
7. Probable cholelithiasis: The patient's CT abdomen and pelvis shows multiple bilateral renal calculi, which may be related to cholelithiasis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Continue IV PPI drip, and consider transfusion for hematocrit <25 or hematocrit drop of >3 in six hours.
2. Leukocytosis: Trend the patient's leukocytosis and fever curve, and repeat the differential count in the morning.
3. Cat bite: Drain the abscess with needle aspiration after endoscopy.
4. Probable UTI: Continue to follow the patient's urinalysis and consider further antibiotic treatment if the patient's symptoms worsen.
5. Dehydration: Continue to monitor the patient's fluid status and consider further treatment if the patient's creatinine level does not improve.
6. Probable cholelithiasis: Consider further imaging studies to evaluate the patient's gallbladder and biliary tree.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the patient is expected to be transferred to the floor once their condition stabilizes."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
   1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Due to multiple ulcerations in the
   context  of high dose aspirin use.  On [**Hospital1 7**] PPI and hematemesis and
   symptomatology has largely resolved.  Hct stable.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] PPI, transition to PO today and will continue for the near
   future.
   -Two peripheral IV
s, active type and cross
   -Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea
   -Transfuse for Hct <25 or Hct drop of > 3 between checks, Check Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
    2)  Leukocytosis:  Improving currently w/ treatment of cat bite and
   the patient
s other processes.  Still, she has long had elevated white
   counts and this deserves further work-up for primary heme process.
   -treat cat bite per belowe
   -Arrange heme f/u as o/p
    3.) EKG changes:  These are improved on repeat ECG, which seems
   consistent with resolution of demand ischemia as tachycardia and anemia
   were treated.  Patient now with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
   -will monitor for any cardiac sx
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills in ICU but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites empirically treating with
   ampicillin-sublactam.  Added vanc as patient is MRSA positive pending I
   and D but may d/c after culture negative.
    5.)  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.  Cr
   now down to 0.8.
   -Continue to trend
    6) Probable UTI: Probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
   esterase.
   -UTI most likely E coli given nitrites which should be covered by
   amp-sublactam, no further abx at this time but will f/u cx
   -Patient with known temporary stent that is misplaced.  Urology would
   ideally like percutaneous drain but serious question if the patient
   wants at home and no indication that this is a procedure she needs
   immediately.
    7)  Goiter on R side of neck: TSH and T4  WNL  this admission. Goiter
   slightly larger on CT Chest [**3-5**]
   -arrange o/p endocrine f/u
    8) Social: Pt lives alone and reports trouble getting to MD [**Last Name (Titles) 5915**]
   (though cat sees vet 2*/yr) Will get SW involved to find resources for

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   the proximal pigtail portion of the right NU stent, with the pigtail
   now
   coiled within the renal pelvis rather than in upper pole calix as

   Multiple bilateral renal calculi are again demonstrated. A few 2-3 mm
   calculi
   are seen adjacent to the right NU stent, in the mid-distal portion of
   the
   ureter in the pelvis.
   2. The bladder is distended, and there is a focus of gas within the
   bladder,
   possibly related to instrumentation. Please correlate.
   3. Extensive colonic diverticulosis.
   4. Probable cholelithiasis.
   5. Small bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.
   6. Intrathoracic stomach.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
   1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Due to multiple ulcerations in the
   context  of high dose aspirin use.  On [**Hospital1 7**] PPI and hematemesis and
   symptomatology has largely resolved.  Hct stable.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] PPI, transition to PO today and will continue for the near
   future.
   -Two peripheral IV
s, active type and cross
   -Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea
   -Transfuse for Hct <25 or Hct drop of > 3 between checks, Check Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
    2)  Leukocytosis:  Improving currently w/ treatment of cat bite and
   the patient
s other processes.  Still, she has long had elevated white
   counts and this deserves further work-up for primary heme process.
   -treat cat bite per belowe
   -Arrange heme f/u as o/p
    3.) EKG changes:  These are improved on repeat ECG, which seems
   consistent with resolution of demand ischemia as tachycardia and anemia
   were treated.  Patient now with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
   -will monitor for any cardiac sx
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills in ICU but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites empirically treating with
   ampicillin-sublactam.  Added vanc as patient is MRSA positive pending I
   and D but may d/c after culture negative.
    5.)  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.  Cr
   now down to 0.8.
   -Continue to trend
    6) Probable UTI: Probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
   esterase.
   -UTI most likely E coli given nitrites which should be covered by
   amp-sublactam, no further abx at this time but will f/u cx
   -Patient with known temporary stent that is misplaced.  Urology would
   ideally like percutaneous drain but serious question if the patient
   wants at home and no indication that this is a procedure she needs
   immediately.
    7)  Goiter on R side of neck: TSH and T4  WNL  this admission. Goiter
   slightly larger on CT Chest [**3-5**]
   -arrange o/p endocrine f/u
    8) Social: Pt lives alone and reports trouble getting to MD [**Last Name (Titles) 5915**]
   (though cat sees vet 2*/yr) Will get SW involved to find resources for
   this very pleasant lady.  She seems to have trouble with transportation
   and will talk to social work about this.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, depression, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) who was admitted to the ICU for upper GIB assessment. The patient presented with hematemesis and was found to have multiple ulcerations in the esophagus and stomach.

The patient's current condition is stable, with the hematemesis and symptomatology largely resolved after treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) is stable, and the patient is being continued on PO PPIs.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient's GIB is a high-risk condition that requires close monitoring and treatment. The patient's PPI therapy is being continued to prevent further bleeding.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be related to the cat bite or other underlying conditions. Further work-up is needed to determine the cause of the leukocytosis and to rule out primary hematological disorders.
3. EKG Changes: The patient's EKG changes are improving, but the patient's tachycardia and anemia may have contributed to the changes. The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative, and the patient is being monitored for any cardiac symptoms.
4. Cat Bite: The patient's cat bite has been treated empirically with ampicillin-sublactam, and the patient is being monitored for signs of infection.
5. Probable UTI: The patient's pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte esterase suggest a probable urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is being treated with amp-sublactam, and further antibiotic therapy may be needed depending on the results of urine cultures.
6. Renal Calculi: The patient has bilateral renal calculi, which may be contributing to the patient's hydronephrosis and kidney function.
7. Small Bilateral Pleural Effusions: The patient has small bilateral pleural effusions, which may be related to the patient's underlying conditions or recent procedures.
8. Intrathoracic Stomach: The patient's stomach is in the thoracic cavity, which may be related to the patient's esophageal or stomach pathology.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin (Hct): 31.8%
* White Blood Cell Count (WBC): 27.7
* Platelet Count (Plt): 461
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.9 mg/dL
* Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): 27 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Na: 143 mEq/L, K: 3.7 mEq/L, Cl: 109 mEq/L, PO4: 2.7 mg/dL
* Liver Function Tests (LFTs): AST: 53 U/L, ALT: 4 U/L, Alkaline Phosphatase: 16 U/L
* Coagulation Studies: PT: 13.7 seconds, PTT: 26.0 seconds, INR: 1.2

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CT Abdomen and Pelvis: Bilateral renal calculi, new right hydronephrosis, and a few 2-3 mm calculi adjacent to the right NU stent.
* Chest CT: Small bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.
* ECG: Improved EKG changes consistent with resolution of demand ischemia.

The patient's medication list includes:

* Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)
* Ondansetron and metoclopramide for nausea
* Ampicillin-sublactam for cat bite and UTI
* Vancomycin for MRSA infection
* Pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Warfarin for DVT prophylaxis

The patient's social situation is complex, with the patient living alone and reporting trouble getting to medical appointments. The patient's neighbor is willing to provide assistance with transportation, and social work is being involved to find resources for the patient."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGI) and sepsis. The patient has a history of taking NSAIDs after a cat bite, which appears infected, and presented with coffee ground emesis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 65 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 122/60 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with a SpO2 of 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, with clear breath sounds and soft, non-tender abdomen.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, with a peak of 27.7 K/uL, and a platelet count of 461. The patient's blood cultures are positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The patient's liver function tests are normal, with a total bilirubin of 0.9 mg/dL and a creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGI) due to peptic ulcer disease (PUD) in the setting of NSAID use after a cat bite and stopping proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
2. Cat bite with leukocytosis and redness/cellulitis at the site, treated with Ampicillin/Sulbactam and Vancomycin for MRSA coverage.
3. Ureteral stents placed for UTI, with a need for stent removal by urology or interventional radiology.
4. Elevated white blood cell count, likely due to infection, but with a history of chronically increased WBC counts in the past.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued bleeding from the UGI due to PUD.
2. Sepsis from the infected cat bite or UTI.
3. Kidney injury or failure due to UTI or sepsis.
4. Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
5. Cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure due to sepsis or UTI.
6. Neurological complications such as septic encephalopathy or stroke due to sepsis or UTI.
7. Infection-related complications such as abscesses or empyemas due to the infected cat bite or UTI.

Given the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring her vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination to detect any potential complications early and initiate appropriate interventions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to peptic ulcer disease (PUD) in the setting of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use after a cat bite. The patient also has a history of chronic and dramatically increased white blood cell (WBC) counts.

The patient underwent upper endoscopy with multiple ulcers, but no active bleeding. The gastrointestinal (GI) department recommends surgical correction of the thoracic stomach. The patient has a positive MRSA screen and cultures from the nasogastric tube (NGTD) are pending.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 65 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 122/60 mmHg. The patient is receiving antibiotics, including ampicillin-sulbactam and vancomycin, and has a central venous catheter (CVC) and arterial line (AL) in place.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 461 x 10^9/L. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels are within normal limits.

The patient's plan includes continuing antibiotics, surgical correction of the thoracic stomach, and close monitoring of the patient's condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's positive MRSA screen and elevated WBC count increase the risk of sepsis.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GIB and ongoing bleeding from the cat bite site increase the risk of further bleeding.
3. Infection: The patient's positive MRSA screen and cultures pending from the NGTD increase the risk of infection.
4. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated BUN and Cr levels may indicate kidney injury, which can worsen with further fluid overload.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying respiratory disease and potential for fluid overload increase the risk of respiratory failure.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's history of hypertension and potential for fluid overload increase the risk of cardiovascular instability.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of chronic and dramatically increased WBC counts may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure the patient's safety and well-being."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to gastrointestinal bleeding, coffee ground emesis, and a cat bite. The patient has a history of chronic and dramatic increases in white blood cell count, which may be related to an underlying infection.

The patient underwent upper endoscopy, which revealed multiple ulcers but no active bleeding. The GI department is recommending surgical correction of the thoracic stomach. The patient's wound from the cat bite is infected, and cultures have been sent.

The patient is receiving antibiotics for MRSA coverage and has a history of NSAID use. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, an elevated white blood cell count, and a positive MRSA screen. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 65 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 122/60 mmHg.

The patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including:

1. Infection: The patient has a positive MRSA screen and a history of NSAID use, which may increase the risk of infection.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding.
3. Wound infection: The patient's wound from the cat bite is infected, and there is a risk of further infection.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and is at risk for respiratory failure.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, and there is a risk of cardiovascular instability.
6. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, and there is a risk of renal failure.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued antibiotic therapy for MRSA coverage.
2. Surgical correction of the thoracic stomach.
3. Wound care and monitoring for signs of infection.
4. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results.
5. Consideration of broadening antibiotic coverage given the patient's history of chronic and dramatic increases in white blood cell count.
6. Transfer to the floor for further care and monitoring."
