   Assessment and Plan
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   18 yoF with complicated neurologic history & demyelinating disease,
   hospital course complicated by b/l PE without hemodynamic compromise,
   as well as coag neg staph bactermia.  Transferred to the ICU today for
   tachycardia to 160 and desaturations to mid 80's in setting of likley
   aggitation.
   .
   (#) TACHYCARDIA: has has sinus tach in the 120-130's since arriving tot
   he ICU; was briefly to the 150-160's when she was having a seizure and
   another time when her family was in the room.  Likely ST from PE's.  No
   evidence of volume depletion on exam or labs; going to restart tube
   feeds.  Anxiety may be contributing; on standing clonazepam.  Was
   bactermic, but on vanco without fever or WBC; no evidence now of
   uncontrolled infection driving HR.  Pain may also be contributing from
   general immobilization or some other process (pt non-verbal).  Last TSH
   nml on [**10-25**].
   -- f/u  repeat EKG in am
   -- no need for beta-blocker currently as sinus tach, likely
   compensatory
   -- cont clonazepam for anxiety; frequent reassurance may help though pt
   not able to speak back.
   -- cont tube feeds; low threshold for additional maintenance fluids,
   though will not start now
   -- consider pain control with low dose morphine PRN (though likely not
   primary driver of sinus tach)
   -- cont treatment of PE with heparin ggt; would consider rescanning for
   tx with thrombolytics if becomes hemodynamically unstable.
   -- consider repeating TSH (though would eb difficult to interpret in
   setting of acute illness)
   .
   (#) DESATURATION: resolved; in mid to upper 90's on room air; satted
   briefly while aggitated; tolerated placement of CVL while flat fairly
   well.  No evidence of PNA or extension of PE's currently.  Had another
   brief episode unsustained episode of desat to 60s unprovoked.
   -- cont to treat PE
   -- cont to monitor
   .
   (#) MS, ENCEPHALOPATHY: no clear cause; intermittently seizing; obvious
   CNS infections have been ruled out on LP; JCV and HIV also negative; sx
   been progressively getting worse since being here.  Possibly a delirium
   from hospitalization/pain/anxiety on top of underlying neuro process,
   though pt fairly young and not considered high risk for hospital
   delirium.  no gross elecrolyte or lab abnormalities.
   -- neuro wants repeat MRI under GA which cannot be scheduled until
   [**Name (NI) 501**] (pt requires general anesthesia)
   -- psych and neuro following
   -- zyprexa PRN for aggitation
   (#) PE's:
   -- on heparin ggt now that access has been re-established
   -- will need coumadin 3-6 months
   .
   (#) HTN: listed as a prior dx in H&P, thoguh not on home med list; BP
   has been ~150/80 since being in the ICU
   -- on captopril 6.25 TID
   -- might consider changing from ACE I (afterload reduction) to a CCB or
   other given risk of reflex tachycardia
   .
   (#) COAG NEG STAPH BACTERMIA: PICC was pulled yesterday; on vancomcyin
   (1750 mg IV BID); ID followed
   -- cont vanco for two week course; ? whether needs TTE
   -- will check trough before next 4th dose
   -- ID recs
   -- f/u pending cultures
   (#) SEIZURE: dilantin currently at tx levels; albumin normal.  Seizures
   seem to be the genralize tonic clonic type (witnessed during ICU
   stay).  Seizures are frequent movements small twitches or jerking
   movements of facial muscles or upper and lower extremities.
   -- cont dilantin 200/300
   -- ativan PRN for seizure with concern for injury
   -- seizure precautions
   -- neurology and psych following
   .
   (#) DEMYELINATING DISEASE NOS: being followed by neurology; does not
   have clear diagnosis
   -- neurology wanted repeat MRI under GA (given aggiation); per
   scheduling tech, next available is [**Name (NI) 501**] [**11-13**]
   -- continue solumderol 125 mg QID taper per neuro
   -- FSG QID + SSI PRN while on solumedrol
   .
   (#) ACCESS: ICU team placed left IJ CVL this evening; CXR verified line
   in place
   .
   (#) NUTRITION: restarting tube feeds via NG
   .
   (#) PPX: heparin ggt; protonix; on bowel regimen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old female with a complicated neurologic history and demyelinating disease, currently admitted to the ICU for tachycardia, desaturations, and suspected agitation. The patient has a history of bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise, as well as coag-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Continued seizure activity: The patient has been experiencing frequent generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and the risk of further seizure activity remains high.
2. Respiratory compromise: The patient's desaturations and decreased breath sounds anteriorly may indicate respiratory compromise, which could worsen if not addressed.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia, likely secondary to PE, may lead to cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure if not managed properly.
4. Infection: The patient has coag-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia, which may not be fully treated, and could lead to sepsis or septic shock.
5. Neurological deterioration: The patient's demyelinating disease and encephalopathy may worsen, leading to further neurological deficits or even death.
6. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's elevated PTT and recent placement of a left IJ central venous line (CVL) may increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications.
7. Thrombotic complications: The patient's history of bilateral PE and ongoing heparin therapy may increase the risk of thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's morbid obesity and recent placement of a nasogastric (NG) tube may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration or bowel obstruction.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, close monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team, including neurology, cardiology, and infectious disease specialists, are essential to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   18 yoF with complicated neurologic history & demyelinating disease,
   hospital course complicated by b/l PE without hemodynamic compromise,
   as well as coag neg staph bactermia.  Transferred to the ICU today for
   tachycardia to 160 and desaturations to mid 80's in setting of likley
   aggitation.
   .
   (#) TACHYCARDIA: has has sinus tach in the 120-130's since arriving tot
   he ICU; was briefly to the 150-160's when she was having a seizure and
   another time when her family was in the room.  Likely ST from PE's.  No
   evidence of volume depletion on exam or labs; going to restart tube
   feeds.  Anxiety may be contributing; on standing clonazepam.  Was
   bactermic, but on vanco without fever or WBC; no evidence now of
   uncontrolled infection driving HR.  Pain may also be contributing from
   general immobilization or some other process (pt non-verbal).  Last TSH
   nml on [**10-25**].
   -- f/u  repeat EKG in am
   -- no need for beta-blocker currently as sinus tach, likely
   compensatory
   -- cont clonazepam for anxiety; frequent reassurance may help though pt
   not able to speak back.
   -- cont tube feeds; low threshold for additional maintenance fluids,
   though will not start now
   -- consider pain control with low dose morphine PRN (though likely not
   primary driver of sinus tach)
   -- cont treatment of PE with heparin ggt; would consider rescanning for
   tx with thrombolytics if becomes hemodynamically unstable.
   -- consider repeating TSH (though would eb difficult to interpret in
   setting of acute illness)
   .
   (#) DESATURATION: resolved; in mid to upper 90's on room air; satted
   briefly while aggitated; tolerated placement of CVL while flat fairly
   well.  No evidence of PNA or extension of PE's currently.  Had another
   brief episode unsustained episode of desat to 60s unprovoked.
   -- cont to treat PE
   -- cont to monitor
   .
   (#) MS, ENCEPHALOPATHY: no clear cause; intermittently seizing; obvious
   CNS infections have been ruled out on LP; JCV and HIV also negative; sx
   been progressively getting worse since being here.  Possibly a delirium
   from hospitalization/pain/anxiety on top of underlying neuro process,
   though pt fairly young and not considered high risk for hospital
   delirium.  no gross elecrolyte or lab abnormalities.
   -- neuro wants repeat MRI under GA which cannot be scheduled until
   [**Name (NI) 501**] (pt requires general anesthesia)
   -- psych and neuro following
   -- zyprexa PRN for aggitation
   (#) PE's:
   -- on heparin ggt now that access has been re-established
   -- will need coumadin 3-6 months

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   18 yoF with complicated neurologic history & demyelinating disease,
   hospital course complicated by b/l PE without hemodynamic compromise,
   as well as coag neg staph bactermia.  Transferred to the ICU today for
   tachycardia to 160 and desaturations to mid 80's in setting of likley
   aggitation.

   he ICU; was briefly to the 150-160's when she was having a seizure and
   another time when her family was in the room.  Likely ST from PE's.  No
   evidence of volume depletion on exam or labs; going to restart tube
   feeds.  Anxiety may be contributing; on standing clonazepam.  Was
   bactermic, but on vanco without fever or WBC; no evidence now of
   uncontrolled infection driving HR.  Pain may also be contributing from
   general immobilization or some other process (pt non-verbal).  Last TSH

Summary:

The patient is an 18-year-old female with a complicated neurologic history and demyelinating disease, who was transferred to the ICU due to tachycardia to 160s and desaturations to mid 80's in the setting of likely agitation. She has a history of bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise, as well as coag-negative Staph bacteremia. The patient's condition is complicated by seizure activity, including status epilepticus, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's desaturations and decreased breath sounds anteriorly may indicate respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by her underlying neurologic condition and potential respiratory muscle weakness.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and potential ST-segment changes on EKG may indicate cardiac instability, which could be related to her PE, bacteremia, or underlying cardiac condition.
3. Neurologic deterioration: The patient's seizure activity, including status epilepticus, and altered mental status may indicate worsening of her underlying neurologic condition, which could lead to further neurological deterioration.
4. Infection: The patient's coag-negative Staph bacteremia may lead to sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications if not properly treated.
5. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's bilateral PE may lead to further respiratory compromise and potentially life-threatening complications if not properly treated.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's morbid obesity and potential bowel dysfunction may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation, bowel obstruction, or perforation.
7. Nutritional compromise: The patient's morbid obesity and potential nutritional deficiencies may lead to nutritional compromise, which could exacerbate her underlying medical conditions.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiac, and neurologic status. She should be treated with anticoagulation therapy for her PE, and her bacteremia should be treated with vancomycin. She should also receive anticonvulsant therapy for her seizure activity, and her mental status should be closely monitored. The patient's nutritional needs should be carefully assessed and managed, and her gastrointestinal function should be closely monitored for potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-inch tall, 115.6 kg (obese) female admitted to the ICU with seizures, desaturations, and altered mental status. She has a history of atypical multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis. She is receiving treatment for line infection, pulmonary embolism, and sinus tachycardia. Her current medications include dilantin, vancomycin, pantoprazole, and morphine. She is being monitored for her airway, with a concern for protection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure recurrence: The patient's altered mental status and seizure activity may indicate a risk of further seizures, which could lead to respiratory depression, hypoxia, or aspiration.
2. Airway compromise: The patient's inability to protect her airway due to altered mental status and seizure activity may require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Line infection: The patient's line infection may lead to sepsis, bacteremia, or endocarditis, which could have serious consequences if not treated promptly and effectively.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's pulmonary embolism may worsen if not treated with anticoagulation and thrombolytic therapy, potentially leading to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, or death.
5. Sinus tachycardia: The patient's sinus tachycardia may indicate an underlying anxiety or stress response, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, or cardiac failure if not managed appropriately.
6. Optic neuritis: The patient's optic neuritis may lead to vision loss, blindness, or other visual disturbances if not treated with corticosteroids and other medications.
7. DVT: The patient's DVT may lead to pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, or other complications if not treated with anticoagulation and compression stockings.

Recommendations:

1. Continue monitoring the patient's airway and respiratory status closely.
2. Adjust anticoagulation therapy for the pulmonary embolism as necessary.
3. Manage the patient's sinus tachycardia with beta blockers or other medications as needed.
4. Continue treatment for the line infection with antibiotics and line removal as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's optic neuritis with regular visual exams and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Consider prophylaxis for DVT with compression stockings and anticoagulation therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 18-year-old female with a complicated neurologic history and demyelinating disease, who has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of fever of unknown origin (FUO), pulmonary embolism (PE), altered mental status, and seizure with status epilepticus. The patient has a history of coag-negative staph bacteremia and has been treated with vancomycin.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.1°C (100.6°F)
* Heart rate: 128 bpm (normal range: 115-144 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 162/95 mmHg (normal range: 92-174/40-118 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 34 breaths per minute (normal range: 16-35 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 100% on nasal cannula

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.2-10.6 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 272-282 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Blood glucose: 120-136 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: within normal range
* Coagulation studies: PT/PTT/INR: 14.0/87.6/1.2

The patient has been treated with:

* Vancomycin for coag-negative staph bacteremia
* Heparin sodium for pulmonary embolism
* Metoprolol for hypertension
* Clonazepam for anxiety
* Lorazepam for seizure control
* Pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Protonix for stress ulcer prophylaxis

The patient's potential medical complications are:

* Sepsis due to coag-negative staph bacteremia
* Pulmonary embolism with potential for recurrent embolism
* Hypertension with potential for cardiac complications
* Seizure with potential for status epilepticus
* Altered mental status with potential for delirium
* Fever of unknown origin with potential for underlying infection

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing treatment with vancomycin for coag-negative staph bacteremia
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis and adjusting treatment as necessary
* Managing hypertension with metoprolol and frequent blood pressure monitoring
* Controlling seizures with lorazepam and dilantin
* Monitoring for signs of delirium and adjusting treatment as necessary
* Considering repeat MRI under general anesthesia to rule out underlying CNS infection
* Continuing stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole and protonix
* Monitoring for signs of DVT and adjusting treatment as necessary."

   bacteremia, and baseline bacteria.  There is no evidence of volume
   depletion on exam or labs; Anxiety may be contributing; on standing
   clonazepam.  Was bactermic, but on vanco without fever or WBC.   Pain
   may also be contributing from general immobilization or some other
   process (pt non-verbal).  Last TSH nml on [**10-25**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 18-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including demyelinating disease, who was admitted to the ICU for tachycardia, desaturation, and seizure-like activity. She has a history of bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and coag-neg staph bacteremia. She is currently receiving treatment for PE with heparin and for coag-neg staph bacteremia with vancomycin. She is also taking metoprolol for hypertension and clonazepam for anxiety. She has had multiple episodes of desaturation and seizure-like activity, and has been diagnosed with status epilepticus.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of bilateral PE, which can lead to further complications such as pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular strain, and potentially life-threatening respiratory failure.
2. Coag-neg Staph Bacteremia: The patient is currently receiving treatment for coag-neg staph bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Status Epilepticus: The patient has been diagnosed with status epilepticus, which can lead to further complications such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and potentially life-threatening brain damage.
4. Hypertension: The patient is taking metoprolol for hypertension, which can lead to further complications such as hypotension, bradycardia, and potentially life-threatening cardiovascular events.
5. Anxiety: The patient is taking clonazepam for anxiety, which can lead to further complications such as sedation, respiratory depression, and potentially life-threatening respiratory failure.
6. Immobilization: The patient is immobilized due to her medical condition, which can lead to further complications such as deep vein thrombosis, pressure ulcers, and potentially life-threatening infections.
7. Demyelinating Disease: The patient has a history of demyelinating disease, which can lead to further complications such as worsening neurological symptoms, potentially life-threatening complications, and potentially life-threatening infections.

Recommendations:

1. Continue treatment for PE with heparin and for coag-neg staph bacteremia with vancomycin.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely for signs of worsening PE or bacteremia.
3. Consider elective intubation for good quality MRI to further evaluate the patient's neurological symptoms.
4. Continue treatment for status epilepticus with dilantin and ativan.
5. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and heart rate closely for signs of hypertension or bradycardia.
6. Consider adjusting the patient's medication regimen to better manage her anxiety and potential side effects.
7. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider restarting tube feeds via NG if necessary.
8. Consider consulting with a neurologist to further evaluate the patient's demyelinating disease and potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 18-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including a demyelinating disease, who was transferred to the ICU due to tachycardia and desaturations. The patient has been diagnosed with:

1. Fever of unknown origin (FUO)
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE) with bilateral PEs
3. Altered mental status (AMS) without delirium
4. Seizure with status epilepticus
5. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.1°C (100.6°F)
* Heart rate: 128 bpm (sinus tachycardia)
* Blood pressure: 162/95 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 34 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100% on nasal cannula

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.2-10.6 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 31.6-30.3%
* Platelet count: 272-282 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 120-136 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: normal

The patient's imaging studies show:

* No imaging studies were performed.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Treatment of PE with heparin
* Containment of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia with vancomycin
* Management of seizure disorder with dilantin and ativan
* Management of hypertension with metoprolol
* Monitoring of mental status and potential delirium
* Repeat MRI under general anesthesia to rule out CNS infections
* Follow-up with neurology and psychiatry

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of PE
* Development of sepsis or septic shock
* Increased risk of bleeding due to coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia
* Development of seizures or status epilepticus
* Worsening of hypertension
* Development of delirium or altered mental status
* Increased risk of respiratory failure due to bilateral PEs
* Development of nosocomial infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the medical plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 18-year-old female with a complicated neurologic history and demyelinating disease, who was admitted to the ICU for tachycardia and desaturations. She has a history of bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise, as well as coag-neg staph bacteremia. The patient is currently intubated and has been experiencing fevers, altered mental status, and seizures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of coag-neg staph bacteremia and is currently being treated with vancomycin. There is a risk of developing further infections, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of bilateral PE and is currently being treated with heparin. There is a risk of further PE development or extension of existing emboli.
3. Seizures: The patient has been experiencing seizures, which may be related to her underlying neurologic condition or may be a side effect of medication. There is a risk of seizure control issues or status epilepticus.
4. Demyelinating Disease: The patient has a history of demyelinating disease, which may be exacerbating her neurologic symptoms.
5. Hyperthermia: The patient has been experiencing fevers, which may be related to her infection or other underlying medical conditions.
6. Hypoxia: The patient has experienced desaturations, which may be related to her PE or other underlying medical conditions.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently being treated with metoprolol. There is a risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue treatment of bacteremia with vancomycin and monitor for signs of infection.
2. Continue treatment of PE with heparin and monitor for signs of extension or further development.
3. Monitor seizure activity and adjust medication as necessary to control seizures.
4. Continue treatment of demyelinating disease with solumedrol and follow up with neurology.
5. Monitor for signs of hyperthermia and hypoxia and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Monitor cardiovascular status and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent cardiovascular complications.
7. Follow up with neurology and psychiatry to monitor for signs of delirium or other neurologic complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 18-year-old female with a complicated neurologic history and demyelinating disease, admitted to the ICU for tachycardia to 160 and desaturations to mid 80's. She has a history of bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise, as well as coag-negative Staph bacteremia. She was transferred to the ICU for agitation and observation peri-intubation for an MRI procedure. The patient's current condition includes fever, unknown origin; pulmonary embolism; altered mental status; and seizure activity.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infectious etiologies for encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be related to an underlying infection, which needs to be investigated and treated promptly.
2. Seizure activity: The patient's seizure activity may be a sign of an underlying condition, such as a demyelinating disease or a metabolic disorder. It is essential to monitor the patient's seizure activity and adjust treatment accordingly.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's bilateral PE may lead to further complications, such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, or even death. It is crucial to monitor the patient's oxygenation and ventilation, and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Coag-negative Staph bacteremia: The patient's bacteremia may lead to further complications, such as sepsis, organ failure, or death. It is essential to monitor the patient's blood cultures and adjust treatment accordingly.
5. Demyelinating disease: The patient's demyelinating disease may lead to further complications, such as neurological deficits, cognitive impairment, or even death. It is crucial to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust treatment accordingly.
6. Fever, unknown origin: The patient's fever may be a sign of an underlying infection, which needs to be investigated and treated promptly.
7. Hypercoagulability: The patient's hypercoagulability may lead to further complications, such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or even death. It is essential to monitor the patient's coagulation status and adjust treatment accordingly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Investigate and treat any underlying infections promptly.
3. Monitor the patient's seizure activity and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Monitor the patient's pulmonary embolism and adjust treatment accordingly.
5. Monitor the patient's coag-negative Staph bacteremia and adjust treatment accordingly.
6. Monitor the patient's demyelinating disease and adjust treatment accordingly.
7. Consider further imaging studies, such as a CT or MRI, to rule out any underlying conditions.
8. Consider consulting with a neurologist or infectious disease specialist to further evaluate and manage the patient's condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 18-year-old female with a complicated neurologic history and demyelinating disease, currently admitted to the ICU for tachycardia, desaturations, and suspected agitation. She has been experiencing seizures and has a history of bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise. She has also been diagnosed with coag-negative staph bacteremia and is receiving treatment with vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 39°C (102.2°F)
* Heart rate: 112-126 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 146/84 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.2-12.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.2-10.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 272-332 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6-0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 120-244 mg/dL

The patient's medical history includes:

* Demyelinating disease (no clear diagnosis)
* Bilateral PE
* Coag-negative staph bacteremia
* Seizures
* Tachycardia
* Desaturations
* Agitation

The patient's current medications include:

* Vancomycin for coag-negative staph bacteremia
* Clonazepam for anxiety
* Solumedrol for demyelinating disease
* FSG for gastrointestinal symptoms
* SSI for skin symptoms
* Metoprolol for hypertension
* Dilantin for seizures

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Seizure recurrence
* Bacterial resistance to vancomycin
* Prolonged ICU stay
* Development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Pulmonary embolism recurrence
* Neurological worsening due to underlying demyelinating disease
* Infection complications due to PICC line removal
* Development of hospital-acquired delirium

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued treatment of coag-negative staph bacteremia with vancomycin
* Monitoring of seizure activity and potential adjustments to anticonvulsant medications
* Management of hypertension with metoprolol
* Monitoring of laboratory results and potential adjustments to medications
* Follow-up with neurology and psychiatry services
* Continuation of prophylactic measures for VAP, DVT, and stress ulcer."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 18-year-old female with a complicated neurologic history and demyelinating disease, who was transferred to the ICU due to tachycardia and desaturations after intubation for an MRI procedure. She has a history of bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise, and is currently being treated for coag-neg staph bacteremia. She has also been experiencing seizures, which are being managed with dilantin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, and blood pressure of 146/84 mmHg. Her respiratory status is being supported with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and ongoing treatment with vancomycin may lead to sepsis, which could worsen her respiratory and cardiovascular status.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Complications: The patient's bilateral PE may lead to further complications such as pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular strain, and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.
3. Seizure Control: The patient's seizures may be difficult to control, and the risk of injury or aspiration during seizures is high. The use of anticonvulsant medications may need to be adjusted to achieve optimal seizure control.
4. Demyelinating Disease Flare: The patient's demyelinating disease may be exacerbated by the current infection and inflammation, leading to further neurological deterioration.
5. Coagulation Disorders: The patient's coag-neg staph bacteremia may lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which could worsen her bleeding risk and increase the risk of thrombotic complications.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to her underlying lung disease, infection, and treatment with sedatives and muscle relaxants.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may lead to cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or acute coronary syndrome.
8. Infection Control: The patient's PICC line infection may lead to further complications such as bacteremia or sepsis, and the risk of line-related complications such as thrombosis or bleeding.
9. Nutritional Complications: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and treatment with antibiotics may lead to malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances, which could worsen her overall condition.
10. Psychological Complications: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and treatment may lead to psychological complications such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)."

   1. No definite evidence for intramedullary abnormal enhancement or
   abnormal T2 hyperintensity to suggest multiple sclerosis plaques.
   2. Left psoas muscles and right posterior paraspinal muscle fluid-fluid
   levels, likely represent intramuscular hematomas with surrounding
   inflammation of the muscles. In presence of signs of infection,
   hemorrhagic abcesses cannot
   be excluded.
   3. New large cystic lesion within the perisplenic region, incompletely
   characterized on this examination. This can represent the stomach,
   however,
   cystic lesion other than this cannot be excluded. CT scan of the
   abdomen is
   recommended.
   4. New right upper lobe opacification. Differential diagnostic
   considerations would include right upper lobe atelectasis or pneumonia.
   Given
   the acuity of this lesion, mass lesion is unlikely. Right basilar lower
   lobe
   segmental dependent atelectasis versus aspiration pneumonia.
   MRI Head: 1. Interval development of a heterogeneous FLAIR
   hyperintensity within the
   right cerebral peduncle. Interval decrease in size of the left parietal
   subcortical white matter hyperintensity and stable bilateral forceps
   major,
   splenium, and right cerebellar peduncle/basis pons FLAIR
   hyperintensity. This can be seen demyelinating processes such as
   multiple sclerosis or [**Year (4 digits) 9255**].
   2. Fluid within the right mastoid air cells. In the correct clinical
   history,
   this can reflect mastoiditis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 18-year-old female with a complicated neurologic history and demyelinating disease, currently admitted to the ICU for tachycardia and desaturations. The patient has been experiencing fever, seizure activity, and altered mental status.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 9.2-13.9 K/uL
* Hct: 27.1-31.6%
* Plt: 272-342
* Cr: 0.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 104-244 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.5/85.1/1.3, ALT/AST: 67/22, Alk Phos/T Bili: 49/0.2, Ca++: 8.7 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.4 mg/dL, PO4: 3.6 mg/dL

The patient has a history of coag-neg staph bacteremia, which was treated with vancomycin. The patient is also receiving heparin for pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient's imaging studies show:

* MRI Spine: No definite evidence for intramedullary abnormal enhancement or abnormal T2 hyperintensity to suggest multiple sclerosis plaques.
* MRI Head: Interval development of a heterogeneous FLAIR hyperintensity within the right cerebral peduncle, interval decrease in size of the left parietal subcortical white matter hyperintensity, and stable bilateral forceps major, splenium, and right cerebellar peduncle/basis pons FLAIR hyperintensity.

The patient's medical complications and potential medical complications include:

* Fever, unknown origin (FUO, hyperthermia, pyrexia)
* Pulmonary embolism (PE), acute
* Altered mental status (not delirium)
* Seizure, with status epilepticus
* Demyelinating disease, not otherwise specified (NOS)
* Coag-neg staph bacteremia
* Hemorrhagic abscess in the left psoas or right paraspinal muscles
* Right upper lobe opacification, potentially representing right upper lobe atelectasis or pneumonia
* Possible delirium from hospitalization/pain/anxiety on top of underlying neuro process
* Potential for hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI)

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue vancomycin for coag-neg staph bacteremia
* Continue heparin for pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Increase dilantin to 300 mg PO BID for seizure treatment
* Continue bedside EEG for seizure monitoring
* Follow-up with neurology and psychiatry services
* Continue treatment for possible infections, including VAP and CAUTI
* Monitor for signs of volume depletion and electrolyte imbalances
* Consider anticoagulation therapy with warfarin for 3-6 months

In summary, the patient is a young adult with a complicated medical history and multiple medical complications, including fever, seizure activity, and altered mental status. The patient requires close monitoring and treatment for these complications, as well as potential medical complications, to prevent further deterioration."

   18 yoF with complicated neurologic history & demyelinating disease,
   hospital course complicated by b/l PE without hemodynamic compromise,
   as well as coag neg staph bactermia.  Transferred to the ICU  for
   tachycardia to 160 and desaturations to mid 80's in setting of likley
   agitation and observation peri-intubation for procedure (MRI).
   (#) MS, ENCEPHALOPATHY: no clear cause; intermittently seizing; obvious
   CNS infections have been ruled out on LP; JCV and HIV also negative; sx
   been progressively getting worse since being here.  Possibly a delirium
   from hospitalization/pain/anxiety on top of underlying neuro process,
   though pt fairly young and not considered high risk for hospital
   delirium.  no gross elecrolyte or lab abnormalities.
   -- was extubated yesterday after MRI: results pending today.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 18-year-old female with a complicated neurologic history and demyelinating disease, currently admitted to the ICU for tachycardia and desaturations. The patient has been experiencing fever, altered mental status, and seizure activity.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a known infection with coag-negative staph bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of bilateral PE without hemodynamic compromise, which can lead to respiratory failure and other complications.
3. Demyelinating disease: The patient's underlying condition can lead to further neurological deterioration, including worsening seizures, cognitive impairment, and potential permanent disability.
4. Infection: The patient's MRI results suggest possible infection in the left psoas and right paraspinal muscles, which can lead to abscess formation and other complications.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and potential electrolyte imbalances can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and other cardiac complications.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and further deterioration can lead to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's seizure activity and altered mental status can lead to further neurological deterioration, including worsening seizures, cognitive impairment, and potential permanent disability.
8. Infections: The patient's history of bacteremia and potential line infections can lead to further infections and complications.
9. Coagulopathy: The patient's history of coag-negative staph bacteremia and potential line infections can lead to coagulopathy and bleeding complications.

The patient's treatment plan includes antibiotics for bacteremia, anticoagulation for PE, and treatment for potential infections. The patient's medication regimen includes vancomycin, heparin, and metoprolol, among others. The patient's neurological status will require close monitoring, and further diagnostic testing may be necessary to determine the underlying cause of the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo with demyelinating disorder and severe progression of loss of
   mental status with hospital course compliacted by PE and GPC
   bacteremia.  She has had persistent worsening of mental status and
   function without clearly defined etiology and with concerning findings
   on MRI scan completed.
   1)Altered Mental Status-This is complicated by underlying disorder
   which remains incompletely defined as well as significant insult from
   recurrent seizure activity.
   -Continue with seizure Rx
   -Avoid sedating medications
   -no evidence of infection
   -MRI completed and we will look to neurology input for guidance as to
   how this study adds to understanding
   -Zyprexa held
   -Do need neurology input to guide path moving forward for family
   2)Seizure Disorder-
   -Dilantin by levels to continue
   3)Pulmonary Emboli
   -Heparin IV to continue
   4)Sepsis
coag negative staph bacteremia
   -Vanco to continue
   -Will check CXR, Urine and blood again
   -The problem is there is concern for possible hemorrhagic abscess in
   psoas
there is concern for infection there and will need to be
   discussed with radiology and pursue next best study.  Concern is raised
   for possible areas of hematoma from previous tap.
   -This will be imaged given findings of persistent fevers at this time
   with resting tachycardia

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old female with a complex medical history, including a demyelinating disorder, seizure disorder, and pulmonary emboli. She is currently in the ICU due to altered mental status, which has worsened despite treatment.

The patient's vital signs are concerning, with a fever of 101.3°F, tachycardia, and hypotension. She is receiving invasive ventilation and has a history of recurrent seizure activity. The MRI scan showed multiple demyelinating insults, concerning for multiple sclerosis, and findings in the spine that may indicate a hematoma or abscess.

The patient's laboratory results are significant for a coag-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia, which may be contributing to her worsening mental status and fevers. Her coagulation studies are abnormal, with an INR of 1.3, and her platelet count is 342 K/μL.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and anticoagulants. She is also receiving nutrition and glycemic control through a multi-lumen central line.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and fevers may lead to sepsis, which can cause organ dysfunction and death.
2. Hemorrhagic abscess: The patient's MRI findings suggest the possibility of a hematoma or abscess in the psoas muscle, which could lead to bleeding and infection.
3. Neurological deterioration: The patient's demyelinating disorder and seizure activity may lead to further neurological deterioration, including loss of cognitive function and mobility.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's pulmonary emboli may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and death.
5. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and fevers may lead to secondary infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and skin infections.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management in the ICU. Further evaluation and treatment, including neurology input, radiology studies, and antibiotic therapy, are necessary to address the patient's underlying conditions and prevent potential complications."
