   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral effusions,
   and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred from OSH
   to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Currently minimally responsive despite no sedatives
   (did get some midazolam at times during his OSH ICU stay, not clear
   when last received).  Very elevated ammonia level concerning.  No known
   liver disease prior to this admission.  No other meds that has been on
   immediately able to be implicated.  Depression but family strongly
   doubts other ingestions, and seems to have become markedly worse during
   hospital course.  Other than liver disease and toxins/meds,
   differential can also include myxedema coma (can also cause elevated
   ammonia) and had abnormal TFTs at OSH, though these were attributed to
   sick euthyroid.
   - Check tox panels.
   - Repeat ammonia here.
   - Repeat liver US and LFTs.
   - Check valproate level (?overdose/ingestion).
   - Thyroid workup as below.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated primarily for airway protection; no
   documentation of oxygenation or ventilation problems prior to
   intubation (satting 100% on 2L).  Does have significant abnls on chest
   CT however (multiple areas of infiltrate, RUL ?consolidation vs. mass,
   bilateral effusions).  With worsening of mental status, no plans to
   liberate from vent yet.
   - Continue on AC settings.
   - No sedation.
   - Daily SBT.
   - VAP bundle.
   - Consider Aline for ABG monitoring vs. watching sats and VBGs.
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH.
   Unexpected finding, as no clear reason to have hepatic encephalopathy.
   Too old for genetic metbolic disorders to manifest.  Hypothyroidism can
   lead to hyperammonemia, as can myeloma.  ?influence of TPN.
   - Check valproate as above.
   - Endocrine workup.
   - Hepatology consult in AM.
   - Check SPEP/UPEP.
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema.
   - Continue lactulose for now.
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension.  BPs now improved, off pressors.  Concern
   for sepsis at OSH; no documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis
   of C.diff).
   - PICC line out, tip culture pending.
   - Check blood cultures.
   - Urine culture.
   - Send sputum and check CXR.
   - Review CT with radiology.
   - Consider re-tap of pleural effusions.
   - Antibiotics: vanco around (level >40) for coverage of line infection;
   will continue IV flagyl given C.diff.  Low threshold to add gram
   negative coverage as well (will hold off for now given desquamative
   rash).
   .
   # ?Hypothyroidism.  Low free TFTs on OSH labs.  Normal TSH.  OSH
   thought c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low.  Dopa can also
   suppress TSH; ?contributing to discrepency of TSH and fT4.  Also
   consider secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially
   link edema, encephalopathy, depression, ?hypotension.
   - Endocrine to see in AM.
   - Recheck TFTs here.
   - Per endocrine curbside tonight, recheck cortisol, antibodies, PRL,
   ACTH.
   - Defer giving T4 until endocrine consult and cortisol studies (in case
   patient adrenally insufficient as well).
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Had derm see rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their
   evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash) and more likely
   affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on dependent portions
   of body).
   - Appreciate derm recs.
   - Avoid denuding more skin.
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG.
   - Monitor volume status closely; replete fluid and free water deficits.
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites.  Low albumin at OSH; now improved but
   has received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH.  Low prealbumin.  TTE recently
   within normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).
   Does have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above.
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral).
   - Consider early renal consult for consideration of HD vs. CVVH.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process.
   - Renal involvement tomorrow or in near future.
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension.
   - Check urine (protein, UA, NA, creatinine).
   - Check UPEP/SPEP.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - D5W x 2 liters at 125/hr.
   - Further adjustment based on response to above.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative.
   - Will hold heparin for now given line placement.
   - Place heparin free line.
   - Likely can safely restart given negative recent PF4; another one
   resent here.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  AG 17 - worse in light of low albumin.  ?from
   renal failure.
   - Check lactate.
   - Urine for ketones.
   - Venous pH.
   .
   # DM.
   - ISS here.
   .
   # Recent PE/DVT.
   - Hold heparin for line as above; likely restart after line in place,
   though care given thrombocytopenia.
   .
   # C.diff colitis.
   - Continue IV flagyl.
   - Precautions.
   .
   # FEN: D5W as above, replete electrolytes, slow start TFs (?ileus at
   OSH).  No TPN for now.
   # Prophylaxis: heparin gtt, PPI
   # Access: RIJ from OSH; replace with new CVL.
   # Communication: wife [**Name (NI) 942**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10533**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral effusions,
   and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred from OSH
   to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Currently minimally responsive despite no sedatives
   (did get some midazolam at times during his OSH ICU stay, not clear
   when last received).  Very elevated ammonia level concerning.  No known
   liver disease prior to this admission.  No other meds that has been on
   immediately able to be implicated.  Depression but family strongly
   doubts other ingestions, and seems to have become markedly worse during
   hospital course.  Other than liver disease and toxins/meds,
   differential can also include myxedema coma (can also cause elevated
   ammonia) and had abnormal TFTs at OSH, though these were attributed to
   sick euthyroid.
   - Check tox panels.
   - Repeat ammonia here.
   - Repeat liver US and LFTs.
   - Check valproate level (?overdose/ingestion).
   - Thyroid workup as below.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated primarily for airway protection; no
   documentation of oxygenation or ventilation problems prior to
   intubation (satting 100% on 2L).  Does have significant abnls on chest
   CT however (multiple areas of infiltrate, RUL ?consolidation vs. mass,
   bilateral effusions).  With worsening of mental status, no plans to
   liberate from vent yet.
   - Continue on AC settings.
   - No sedation.
   - Daily SBT.
   - VAP bundle.
   - Consider Aline for ABG monitoring vs. watching sats and VBGs.
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH.
   Unexpected finding, as no clear reason to have hepatic encephalopathy.
   Too old for genetic metbolic disorders to manifest.  Hypothyroidism can
   lead to hyperammonemia, as can myeloma.  ?influence of TPN.
   - Check valproate as above.
   - Endocrine workup.
   - Hepatology consult in AM.
   - Check SPEP/UPEP.
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema.
   - Continue lactulose for now.
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension.  BPs now improved, off pressors.  Concern
   for sepsis at OSH; no documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis
   of C.diff).
   - PICC line out, tip culture pending.
   - Check blood cultures.
   - Urine culture.
   - Send sputum and check CXR.
   - Review CT with radiology.
   - Consider re-tap of pleural effusions.
   - Antibiotics: vanco around (level >40) for coverage of line infection;
   will continue IV flagyl given C.diff.  Low threshold to add gram
   negative coverage as well (will hold off for now given desquamative
   rash).
   .
   # ?Hypothyroidism.  Low free TFTs on OSH labs.  Normal TSH.  OSH
   thought c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low.  Dopa can also
   suppress TSH; ?contributing to discrepency of TSH and fT4.  Also
   consider secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially
   link edema, encephalopathy, depression, ?hypotension.
   - Endocrine to see in AM.
   - Recheck TFTs here.
   - Per endocrine curbside tonight, recheck cortisol, antibodies, PRL,
   ACTH.
   - Defer giving T4 until endocrine consult and cortisol studies (in case
   patient adrenally insufficient as well).
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Had derm see rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their
   evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash) and more likely
   affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on dependent portions
   of body).
   - Appreciate derm recs.
   - Avoid denuding more skin.
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG.
   - Monitor volume status closely; replete fluid and free water deficits.
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites.  Low albumin at OSH; now improved but
   has received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH.  Low prealbumin.  TTE recently
   within normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).
   Does have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above.
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral).
   - Consider early renal consult for consideration of HD vs. CVVH.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process.
   - Renal involvement tomorrow or in near future.
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension.
   - Check urine (protein, UA, NA, creatinine).
   - Check UPEP/SPEP.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - D5W x 2 liters at 125/hr.
   - Further adjustment based on response to above.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative.
   - Will hold heparin for now given line placement.
   - Place heparin free line.
   - Likely can safely restart given negative recent PF4; another one
   resent here.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  AG 17 - worse in light of low albumin.  ?from

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He was admitted to the hospital with dyspnea on exertion, worsening anasarca, bilateral effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline. He is currently in the ICU with severe encephalopathy, respiratory failure, and hyperammonemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Septic shock/hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has improved, but there is concern for sepsis given the presence of C. difficile and the possibility of line infection.
2. Hypothyroidism: The patient's low free T4 levels and normal TSH suggest hypothyroidism, which could be contributing to his encephalopathy, anasarca, and depression.
3. Anasarca: The patient's profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, and ascites are likely related to his CKD, hypothyroidism, and possibly other underlying conditions.
4. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's worsening kidney function is likely due to his DM, ATN from hypotension, and other factors.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels are likely due to free water losses from his skin sloughing and medications.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's drop in platelet count is concerning for HIT, but the PF4 test was negative.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's acidosis is likely related to his renal failure and possibly other factors.
8. C. difficile colitis: The patient is being treated for C. difficile colitis with IV flagyl.
9. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection, and his chest CT shows multiple areas of infiltrate and bilateral effusions.

The patient's current medications include:

* Vancomycin for coverage of line infection
* IV flagyl for C. difficile colitis
* Pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Fentanyl for pain management
* Lactulose for hyperammonemia
* IV albumin for anasarca

The patient's lab results show:

* Ammonia levels >200
* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, Alk Phos, T Bili)
* Low albumin and prealbumin levels
* Low free T4 levels
* High sodium levels
* Elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels
* Low platelet count
* Elevated lactate levels

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest CT with multiple areas of infiltrate and bilateral effusions
* Abdominal US with patent portal vein, small ascites, and left pleural effusion
* Head CT with normal findings

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing IV flagyl for C. difficile colitis
* Repeating ammonia levels and liver function tests
* Checking valproate levels
* Performing a thyroid workup
* Monitoring volume status closely
* Providing nutrition support (prefer enteral)
* Considering early renal consult for consideration of HD vs. CVVH
* Monitoring for septic shock and hypotension
* Repeating lab tests and imaging studies as needed."

   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral effusions,
   and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred from OSH
   to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Certainly wide differential. Abnormal thyroid
   function is concerning for myxedema coma, however  repeat free T4 less
   concerning. Elevated Ammonia is also unusual, however no clear
   etiology. Valproate level negative. Would also consider seizure and
   infectious encephalitis.
   - Check tox panels.
   - FU Hepatology Recs
   - FU Endocrine Recs
   - FU Neurology Recs
   - 24 hour eeg today
   - Consider imaging for encephalitis vs. LP.
   - Thyroid workup
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated primarily for airway protection; no
   documentation of oxygenation or ventilation problems prior to
   intubation (satting 100% on 2L).
   - Would not extubate until mental status improves.
   - Continue on AC settings.
   - No sedation.
   - Daily SBT.
   - VAP bundle.
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH.
   Unexpected finding, as no clear reason to have hepatic encephalopathy.
   Too old for genetic metbolic disorders to manifest.  Hypothyroidism can
   lead to hyperammonemia, as can myeloma.  ?influence of TPN.
   - FU hepatology recommendations.
   - FU Endocrine recommendations.
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension.  Concern for sepsis vs. Volume depletion
   given insensible fluid loss. No documented new infections yet (previous
   diagnosis of C.diff).  Overnight with low MAPs. Levophed restarted.
   - Levophed to maintain MAPS>60
   - PICC line out, RIJ out tip culture pending.
   - Check blood cultures.
   - Urine culture.
   - Send sputum and check CXR.
   - Review CT with radiology.
   - Antibiotics: vanco around (level >40) for coverage of line infection;
   will continue IV flagyl given C.diff.
   .
   # ?Hypothyroidism.  Low free TFTs on OSH labs.  Normal TSH.  OSH
   thought c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low.  Dopa can also
   suppress TSH; ?contributing to discrepency of TSH and fT4.  Also
   consider secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially
   link edema, encephalopathy, depression, ?hypotension.
   - Endocrine to see in AM.
   - Recheck TFTs here.
   - Per endocrine curbside tonight, recheck cortisol, antibodies, PRL,
   ACTH.
   - Defer giving T4 until endocrine consult and cortisol studies (in case
   patient adrenally insufficient as well).
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Had derm see rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their
   evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash) and more likely
   affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on dependent portions
   of body).
   - Appreciate derm recs.
   - Avoid denuding more skin.
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG.
   - Monitor volume status closely; replete fluid and free water deficits.
   - may need transport to burn unit for further support if denuding
   continues.
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites.  Low albumin at OSH; now improved but
   has received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH.  Low prealbumin.  TTE recently
   within normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).
   Does have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above.
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral).
   - Consider early renal consult for consideration of HD vs. CVVH.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process.
   - Renal involvement tomorrow or in near future.
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension.
   - Check urine (protein, UA, NA, creatinine).
   - Check UPEP/SPEP.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - D5W x 2 liters at 125/hr:  Free Water deficit. 3.4 liters.
   - Further adjustment based on response to above.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative.
   - Will hold heparin for now given line placement.
   - Place heparin free line.
   - Discuss with Heme and consider starting argatroban.
   - Likely can safely restart given negative recent PF4; another one
   resent here.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  AG 17 - worse in light of low albumin.  ?from
   renal failure.
   - Check lactate.
   - Urine for ketones.
   - Venous pH.
   .
   # DM.
   - ISS here.
   .
   # Recent PE/DVT.
   - Hold heparin for line as above; likely restart after line in place,
   though care given thrombocytopenia.
   .
   # C.diff colitis.
   - Continue IV flagyl.
   - Precautions.
   .
   # FEN: D5W as above, replete electrolytes, slow start TFs (?ileus at
   OSH).  No TPN for now.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe encephalopathy, anasarca, bilateral effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline.

The patient's current condition is critical, with multiple organ dysfunction. He has:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient has severe encephalopathy, with abnormal thyroid function, elevated ammonia levels, and no clear etiology. He is at risk for sepsis, hypothyroidism, and myxedema coma.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation. He has no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation problems prior to intubation.
3. Hyperammonemia: The patient has persistent hyperammonemia, with no clear reason for this finding. He is at risk for hepatic encephalopathy and requires further evaluation.
4. Septic shock/hypotension: The patient has low mean arterial pressures (MAPs) and is at risk for sepsis, volume depletion, and multi-organ dysfunction.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient has low free thyroxine (T4) levels, which may contribute to his encephalopathy and other symptoms.
6. Rash: The patient has a desquamative rash, particularly over his extremities, which may be related to his anasarca and changing volume status.
7. Anasarca: The patient has profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small pericardial effusion, and ascites, which may be related to his hypothyroidism, CKD, and other underlying conditions.
8. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's renal function has worsened, and he is at risk for further renal insults and complications.
9. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to free water losses from his skin sloughing and medications.
10. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may be related to his sepsis, hypothyroidism, or other underlying conditions.
11. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, which may be related to his renal failure and other underlying conditions.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Encephalopathy: Further evaluation and management of his encephalopathy, including thyroid function tests, ammonia levels, and imaging studies.
2. Respiratory failure: Continued mechanical ventilation and close monitoring of his respiratory status.
3. Hyperammonemia: Further evaluation and management of his hyperammonemia, including liver function tests and imaging studies.
4. Septic shock/hypotension: Close monitoring of his blood pressure and volume status, with treatment of sepsis and volume depletion as necessary.
5. Hypothyroidism: Further evaluation and management of his hypothyroidism, including thyroid function tests and hormone replacement therapy.
6. Rash: Close monitoring of his rash and skin status, with treatment of any underlying conditions.
7. Anasarca: Close monitoring of his anasarca and fluid status, with treatment of any underlying conditions.
8. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Close monitoring of his renal function and treatment of any underlying conditions.
9. Hypernatremia: Correction of his hypernatremia with fluid and electrolyte replacement.
10. Thrombocytopenia: Close monitoring of his platelet count and treatment of any underlying conditions.
11. Metabolic acidosis: Correction of his metabolic acidosis with bicarbonate therapy and close monitoring of his renal function.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement."

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral effusions,
   and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred from OSH
   to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   # Encephalopathy.  Currently minimally responsive despite no sedatives
   (did get some midazolam at times during his OSH ICU stay, not clear
   when last received).  Very elevated ammonia level concerning.  No known
   liver disease prior to this admission.  No other meds that has been on
   immediately able to be implicated.  Depression but family strongly
   doubts other ingestions, and seems to have become markedly worse during
   hospital course.  Other than liver disease and toxins/meds,
   differential can also include myxedema coma (can also cause elevated
   ammonia) and had abnormal TFTs at OSH, though these were attributed to
   sick euthyroid.
   - Check tox panels.
   - Repeat ammonia here.
   - Repeat liver US and LFTs.
   - Check valproate level (?overdose/ingestion).
   - Thyroid workup as below.
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated primarily for airway protection; no
   documentation of oxygenation or ventilation problems prior to
   intubation (satting 100% on 2L).  Does have significant abnls on chest
   CT however (multiple areas of infiltrate, RUL ?consolidation vs. mass,
   bilateral effusions).  With worsening of mental status, no plans to
   liberate from vent yet.
   - Continue on AC settings.
   - No sedation.
   - Daily SBT.
   - VAP bundle.
   - Consider Aline for ABG monitoring vs. watching sats and VBGs.
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH.
   Unexpected finding, as no clear reason to have hepatic encephalopathy.
   Too old for genetic metbolic disorders to manifest.  Hypothyroidism can
   lead to hyperammonemia, as can myeloma.  ?influence of TPN.
   - Check valproate as above.
   - Endocrine workup.
   - Hepatology consult in AM.
   - Check SPEP/UPEP.
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema.
   - Continue lactulose for now.
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension.  BPs now improved, off pressors.  Concern
   for sepsis at OSH; no documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis
   of C.diff).
   - PICC line out, tip culture pending.
   - Check blood cultures.
   - Urine culture.
   - Send sputum and check CXR.
   - Review CT with radiology.
   - Antibiotics: vanco around (level >40) for coverage of line infection;
   will continue IV flagyl given C.diff.  Low threshold to add gram
   negative coverage as well (will hold off for now given desquamative
   rash).
   .
   # ?Hypothyroidism.  Low free TFTs on OSH labs.  Normal TSH.  OSH
   thought c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low.  Dopa can also
   suppress TSH; ?contributing to discrepency of TSH and fT4.  Also
   consider secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially
   link edema, encephalopathy, depression, ?hypotension.
   - Endocrine to see in AM.
   - Recheck TFTs here.
   - Per endocrine curbside tonight, recheck cortisol, antibodies, PRL,
   ACTH.
   - Defer giving T4 until endocrine consult and cortisol studies (in case
   patient adrenally insufficient as well).
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Had derm see rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their
   evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash) and more likely
   affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on dependent portions
   of body).
   - Appreciate derm recs.
   - Avoid denuding more skin.
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG.
   - Monitor volume status closely; replete fluid and free water deficits.
   .
   # Anasarca.  Mild diffuse anasarca, small pericardial effusion,
   ascites.  Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has received IV albumin
   [**Hospital1 **] at OSH.  Low prealbumin.  TTE recently within normal limits (mild
   diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does have CKD. Acute liver
   disease, Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above.
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral).
   - Consider early renal consult for consideration of HD vs. CVVH.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process.
   - Renal involvement tomorrow or in near future.
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension.
   - Check urine (protein, UA, NA, creatinine).
   - Check UPEP/SPEP.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - D5W x 2 liters at 125/hr.
   - Further adjustment based on response to above.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative.
   - Will hold heparin for now given line placement.
   - Place heparin free line.
   - Likely can safely restart given negative recent PF4; another one
   resent here.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  AG 17 - worse in light of low albumin.  ?from
   renal failure.
   - Check lactate.
   - Urine for ketones.
   - Venous pH.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, laryngeal and bladder cancer, and recent pulmonary embolism. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe encephalopathy, respiratory failure, and anasarca. He has been intubated for airway protection and is receiving mechanical ventilation. His laboratory results show elevated ammonia levels, hypernatremia, metabolic acidosis, and thrombocytopenia. He has also developed a desquamative rash, and his liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal. He has a history of C. difficile colitis and is currently receiving antibiotics for a suspected line infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated ammonia levels and abnormal LFTs suggest liver dysfunction, which can lead to encephalopathy.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to his underlying lung disease, and the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is high.
3. Anasarca: The patient's anasarca is likely due to his underlying kidney disease and liver dysfunction, and can lead to complications such as respiratory failure and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Septic shock: The patient's suspected line infection and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of septic shock.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's low free T4 levels and abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels suggest hypothyroidism, which can contribute to his encephalopathy and anasarca.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely due to his underlying disease and may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is likely due to his underlying kidney disease and liver dysfunction, and can lead to complications such as seizures and brain damage.
8. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely due to his underlying kidney disease and liver dysfunction, and can lead to complications such as respiratory failure and electrolyte imbalances.
9. C. difficile colitis: The patient's C. difficile colitis is likely due to his underlying kidney disease and liver dysfunction, and can lead to complications such as septicemia and death.

ICU Care:

The patient's ICU care should focus on managing his underlying medical conditions, including his encephalopathy, respiratory failure, anasarca, and septic shock. He should be closely monitored for signs of worsening respiratory failure, septic shock, and bleeding complications. His medications should be adjusted as needed to manage his symptoms and prevent complications. He should also receive regular insulin sliding scale to manage his blood glucose levels."

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary
   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury. Hyperammonemia may be
   contributing to component of hepatic encephalopathy. Possible hepatic
   dysfunction may prolong the time it takes to clear Versed. Abnormal
   thyroid function initially concerning for myxedema coma, but less
   likely at this time. Would also consider seizure and infectious
   encephalitis. Valproic level < 3; less likely ingestion.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue 24 hour EEG
   - Consider MRI/LP if patient does not improve
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L).
   - Consider extubate despite poor mental status
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - No sedation
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily SBT
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Concern for
   sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No documented
   new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed currently
   off. Unable to load outside hospital CT in our PACS system.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body).
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG
   - Monitor volume status closely; replete fluid and free water deficit
   aggressively as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  OSH thought
   c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low. Dopa can also suppress TSH
   and may be contributing to discrepancy of TSH and fT4.  Also consider
   secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially link edema,
   encephalopathy, depression, hypotension.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider early renal consult for consideration of HD vs. CVVH
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Consider renal involvement
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  AG 17 - worse in light of low albumin.  ?from
   renal failure.
   - Check lactate.
   - Urine for ketones.
   - Venous pH.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Monitor electrolytes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative. Suspicion is high.
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   - Resend PF4, serotonin release assay
   .
   # DM.

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary
   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury. Hyperammonemia may be
   contributing to component of hepatic encephalopathy. Possible hepatic
   dysfunction may prolong the time it takes to clear Versed. Abnormal
   thyroid function initially concerning for myxedema coma, but less
   likely at this time. Would also consider seizure and infectious
   encephalitis. Valproic level < 3; less likely ingestion.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue 24 hour EEG
   - Consider MRI/LP if patient does not improve
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L).
   - Consider extubate despite poor mental status
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - No sedation
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily SBT
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Concern for
   sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No documented
   new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed currently
   off. Unable to load outside hospital CT in our PACS system.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body).
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG
   - Monitor volume status closely; replete fluid and free water deficit
   aggressively as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  OSH thought
   c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low. Dopa can also suppress TSH
   and may be contributing to discrepancy of TSH and fT4.  Also consider
   secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially link edema,
   encephalopathy, depression, hypotension.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider early renal consult for consideration of HD vs. CVVH
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Consider renal involvement
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  AG 17 - worse in light of low albumin.  ?from
   renal failure.
   - Check lactate.
   - Urine for ketones.
   - Venous pH.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Monitor electrolytes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative. Suspicion is high.
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   - Resend PF4, serotonin release assay
   .
   # DM.
   - ISS
   .
   # Recent PE/DVT
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   .
   # C.diff colitis.
   - Continue IV flagyl.
   - Precautions.
   .
   # FEN: D5W as above, replete electrolytes, slow start TFs (?ileus at
   OSH).  No TPN for now.
   # Prophylaxis: heparin gtt, PPI
   # Access: RIJ from OSH; replace with new CVL.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He was admitted to the ICU with severe encephalopathy, anasarca, bilateral pulmonary effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Encephalopathy: Wide differential diagnosis, including anoxic brain injury, hepatic encephalopathy, seizure, and infectious encephalitis.
2. Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection, with no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation problems prior to intubation.
3. Septic shock/hypotension: Hypotension improved, but concern for sepsis vs. volume depletion remains. Levophed is currently off, and the patient is receiving vancomycin, flagyl, and cefepime.
4. Rash: Desquamative rash over extremities, with no mucosal lesions observed. Dermatology has evaluated the rash and ruled out Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.
5. Hyperammonemia: Ammonia levels >200, with no clear reason for hepatic encephalopathy. Consideration of hypothyroidism, multiple myeloma, and genetic metabolic disorder.
6. Hypothyroidism: Low free T4 levels, with normal TSH. Concern for sick euthyroid syndrome.
7. Anasarca: Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small pericardial effusion, and ascites.
8. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Worsening to 4 from baseline 2.5-3, with concern for ATN, prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vancomycin levels, and other processes.
9. Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap 17, with concern for renal failure.
10. Hypernatremia: Iatrogenic, likely due to free water losses from skin sloughing, medications, and other factors.
11. Thrombocytopenia: Pattern of drop concerns for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), but PF4 is negative.
12. Diabetes mellitus: ISS.
13. Recent PE/DVT: Hold heparin, start argatroban.
14. C. diff colitis: Continue IV flagyl, precautions.

The patient's medical team has recommended the following:

1. Continue 24-hour EEG to monitor for seizure activity.
2. Consider MRI/LP if the patient does not improve.
3. Follow Endocrinology recommendations for hypothyroidism and hyperammonemia.
4. Follow Hepatology recommendations for liver dysfunction and hyperammonemia.
5. Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema.
6. Continue lactulose for hyperammonemia.
7. Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, and hypotension.
8. Follow SPEP/UPEP for renal involvement.
9. Monitor electrolytes and replete fluids aggressively.
10. Consider early renal consult for consideration of hemodialysis (HD) vs. continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement."

   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary
   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury. Hyperammonemia may be
   contributing to component of hepatic encephalopathy. Possible hepatic
   dysfunction may prolong the time it takes to clear Versed. Abnormal
   thyroid function initially concerning for myxedema coma, but less
   likely at this time. Would also consider seizure and infectious
   encephalitis. Valproic level < 3; less likely ingestion.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue 24 hour EEG
   - Consider MRI/LP if patient does not improve
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L).
   - Consider extubate despite poor mental status
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - No sedation
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily SBT
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Concern for
   sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No documented
   new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed currently
   off. Unable to load outside hospital CT in our PACS system.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body).
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG
   - Monitor volume status closely; replete fluid and free water deficit
   aggressively as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)

   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it

   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  OSH thought
   c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low. Dopa can also suppress TSH
   and may be contributing to discrepancy of TSH and fT4.  Also consider
   secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially link edema,
   encephalopathy, depression, hypotension.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid

   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider early renal consult for consideration of HD vs. CVVH
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Consider renal involvement
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Worsening at this time also in light of low
   albumin. Question etiology from renal failure.
   - Consider renal involvement
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Monitor electrolytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 EEG - At [**2171-2-16**] 01:03 PM
 STOOL CULTURE - At [**2171-2-16**] 06:25 PM
   sent for c-diff
   - KUB wet read without frank dilatation or obstruction seen.
   - Hematology curbside consult recommended starting agatroban given
   concern for HIT, re-obtain PF4 and serotonin release.
   - Hepatology recommended IV thiamine (ordered), replace thyroxine (not
   ordered due to endocrinology recommendations), continue broad spectrum
   antibiotics, lactulose NG and enema daily, supportive care.
   - Endocrine recommended to 1) check full thyroid panel including TSH,
   total T4, total T3, T3 uptake - no treatment with thyroid hormone
   indicated at this time (ordered); 2) check free cortisol - no steroids
   at this time (ordered); 3) replace free water slowly; 4) continue ISS
   - Neurology recommended to continue 24 bedside EEG to see if he
   improves at all given more time off Versed, to get NCHCT to evaluate
   for grey-white matter differentiation once EEG leads are off, and to
   consider MRI/LP in the future if the patient does not improve.
   - [**Hospital1 10551**] formula of 18% of body surface area burn over back 7.2L over
   first 24 hours; 3.6L over first 8 hours. Ordered LR and will recheck
   electrolytes.

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary
   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury. This might explain
   components of renal failure [**2-26**] poor perfusion and skin sloughing also
   [**2-26**] poor perfusion. Hyperammonemia may be contributing to component of
   hepatic encephalopathy. Possible hepatic dysfunction may prolong the
   time it takes to clear Versed. Abnormal thyroid function initially
   concerning for myxedema coma, but less likely at this time. Would also
   consider seizure and infectious encephalitis. Valproic level < 3; less
   likely ingestion.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations; appreciate their input and
   assessment of poor activity on 20 minute EKG. This will determine how
   we manage dermatology, renal, burn care consults as below.
   - Continue 24 hour EEG
   - Consider MRI/LP if patient does not improve
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L).
   - Unlikely candidate for SBT, extubation at this time given diffuse
   encephalopathy
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body). Question whether hypoperfusion of skin may
   also lead to these changes. Nursing staff concerned regarding care of
   skin denudation.
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG and Silvadene
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   - Consider burn care consult pending neuro recommendations
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Previous
   concern for sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No
   documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed
   currently off. Unable to load outside hospital CT in our PACS system.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   - Low threshold for skin wound culture given concern for Pseudomonas
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  OSH thought
   c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low. Dopa can also suppress TSH
   and may be contributing to discrepancy of TSH and fT4.  Also consider
   secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially link edema,
   encephalopathy, depression, hypotension.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Worsening at this time also in light of low
   albumin. Question etiology from renal failure.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids
   - Monitor electrolytes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative. Suspicion is high.

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary
   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury. This might explain
   components of renal failure [**2-26**] poor perfusion and skin sloughing also
   [**2-26**] poor perfusion. Hyperammonemia may be contributing to component of
   hepatic encephalopathy. Possible hepatic dysfunction may prolong the
   time it takes to clear Versed. Abnormal thyroid function initially
   concerning for myxedema coma, but less likely at this time. Would also
   consider seizure and infectious encephalitis. Valproic level < 3; less
   likely ingestion.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations; appreciate their input and
   assessment of poor activity on 20 minute EKG. This will determine how
   we manage dermatology, renal, burn care consults as below.
   - Continue 24 hour EEG
   - Consider MRI/LP if patient does not improve
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L).
   - Unlikely candidate for SBT, extubation at this time given diffuse
   encephalopathy
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body). Question whether hypoperfusion of skin may
   also lead to these changes. Nursing staff concerned regarding care of
   skin denudation.
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG and Silvadene
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   - Consider burn care consult pending neuro recommendations
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Previous
   concern for sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No
   documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed
   currently off. Unable to load outside hospital CT in our PACS system.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   - Low threshold for skin wound culture given concern for Pseudomonas
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  OSH thought
   c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low. Dopa can also suppress TSH
   and may be contributing to discrepancy of TSH and fT4.  Also consider
   secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially link edema,
   encephalopathy, depression, hypotension.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Worsening at this time also in light of low
   albumin. Question etiology from renal failure.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids
   - Monitor electrolytes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative. Suspicion is high.
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   - Resend PF4, serotonin release assay
   .
   # Recent PE/DVT
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   .
   # h/o C.Diff colitis.
   - Continue precaution
   - Continue antibiotics as above

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral effusions,
   and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred from OSH
   to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   # Encephalopathy.  Currently minimally responsive despite no sedatives
   (did get some midazolam at times during his OSH ICU stay, not clear
   when last received).  Very elevated ammonia level concerning.  No known
   liver disease prior to this admission.  No other meds that has been on
   immediately able to be implicated.  Depression but family strongly
   doubts other ingestions, and seems to have become markedly worse during
   hospital course.  - Thyroid workup as below. Most likely
   hypoxic/hypotensive brain/kidney/liver injury
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated primarily for airway protection; no
   documentation of oxygenation or ventilation problems prior to
   intubation (satting 100% on 2L).  Does have significant abnls on chest
   CT however (multiple areas of infiltrate, RUL ?consolidation vs. mass,
   bilateral effusions).  With worsening of mental status, no plans to
   liberate from vent yet.
   - Continue on AC settings.
   - No sedation.
    - VAP bundle.
   - Consider Aline for ABG monitoring vs. watching sats and VBGs.
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH.
   Unexpected finding, as no clear reason to have hepatic encephalopathy.
   Too old for genetic metbolic disorders to manifest.  Hypothyroidism can
   lead to hyperammonemia, as can myeloma.  ?influence of TPN.
    - Check valproate as above.
    Head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema.
   -Continue lactulose for now.
   # Septic shock/hypotension.  BPs now improved, off pressors.  Concern
   for sepsis at OSH; no documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis
   of C.diff).
   - PICC line out, tip culture pending.
   - Check blood cultures.
   - Urine culture.
   - Send sputum and check CXR.
   - Antibiotics: vanco around (level >40) for coverage of line infection;
   will continue IV flagyl given C.diff.  Low threshold to add gram
   negative coverage as well (will hold off for now given desquamative
   rash).
   # ?Hypothyroidism.  Low free TFTs on OSH labs.  Normal TSH.  Endocrine
   thought c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low.  .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Ask Briham Burn Unit for rec's on care
   # Anasarca.  Mild diffuse anasarca, small pericardial effusion,
   ascites.  Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has received IV albumin
   [**Hospital1 **] at OSH.  Low prealbumin.  TTE recently within normal limits (mild
   diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does have CKD. Acute liver
   disease, Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above.
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral).
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension, prerenal/overdiuresis,
   elevated vanc levels, other process.
    # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - D5W x 2 liters at 125/hr.
   - Further adjustment based on response to above.
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative.
   - Will hold heparin for now given line placement
   _On Argatroban
   # Metabolic acidosis.  AG 17 - worse in light of low albumin.  ?from
   renal failure.
   # DM.
    - ISS here.
   # Recent PE/DVT.
    Argatroban because of HIT
   - Hold heparin for line as above; likely restart after line in place,
   though care given thrombocytopenia
   # C.diff colitis.
   - Continue IV flagyl.
    - Precautions.
   # FEN: D5W as above, replete electrolytes, slow start TFs (?ileus at
   OSH).  No TPN for now.
   # Prophylaxis: boots, PPI
   # Access: RIJ from OSH; replaced with new CVL.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer, who was admitted to the ICU with severe encephalopathy, respiratory failure, hyperammonemia, septic shock, and anasarca. He has been treated with various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and thyroid hormones, and has undergone imaging studies, including a head CT scan and chest CT scan. His current condition is critical, with multiple organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic/hypotensive brain injury: The patient's severe encephalopathy may be due to hypoxia or hypotension, which can lead to permanent brain damage if not treated promptly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can be life-threatening.
3. Hyperammonemia: The patient's hyperammonemia may worsen if not treated, leading to further brain damage, seizures, and death.
4. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock may progress to multi-organ failure, including cardiac, renal, and hepatic failure.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen if not treated, leading to bleeding complications.
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen if not treated, leading to further organ dysfunction.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if not treated, leading to further metabolic and cardiovascular complications.
8. Anasarca: The patient's anasarca may worsen if not treated, leading to further cardiovascular and respiratory complications.
9. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen if not treated, leading to further renal failure and electrolyte imbalances.
10. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may worsen if not treated, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and cardiovascular complications.

Based on the patient's current condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to detect any potential complications and adjust his treatment plan accordingly."

   - Neurology read head CT as reduced grey/white distinction in parietal
   cortex with effacement of gyri posteriorly. Read EEG as markedly
   reduced amplitude, without obvious slow activity - not really
   consistent with metabolic encephalopathy, nor PRES. Most consistent
   with anoxic injury. Wise to attempt correction of metabolic
   disturbance. Avoid sedation. Repeat CT or perform MRI on [**2-18**] (edema
   likely more evident then). No need for 24 hr EEG given no seizure
   activity.
   - 24 hr EEG started. Can possibly be stopped on [**2-18**].
   - Talked to wife, daughters and other family members. Described likely
   brain injury with poor prognosis. Discussed this as a decision point -
   i.e. neurologic injury will be something that we discuss with family in
   planning further goals. They have begun to speak about this. Mentioned
   importance of staying on top of serious skin condition while
   determining neurologic prognosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary
   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury, however was a relatively
   short period. Hyperammonemia may be contributing to component of
   hepatic encephalopathy, however ammonia was high prior to major decline
   in mental status. Possible hepatic dysfunction may prolong the time it
   takes to clear Versed. Abnormal thyroid function initially concerning
   for myxedema coma, but less likely given Thyroid Function that looks
   like sick euthyroid. Valproic level < 3; less likely ingestion. EEG
   with concern for anoxic brain injury. Very poor prognosis at this
   stage.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L). Large tidal
   volumes, low respiratory rate most likely secondary to central
   etiology.
   - Unlikely candidate for SBT, extubation at this time given diffuse
   encephalopathy
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body). Question whether hypoperfusion of skin may
   also lead to these changes. Nursing staff concerned regarding care of
   skin denudation.
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG and Silvadene
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   - Consider burn care consult pending neuro recommendations
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Previous
   concern for sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No
   documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed
   currently off. Unable to load outside hospital CT in our PACS system.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   - Low threshold for skin wound culture given concern for Pseudomonas
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  OSH thought
   c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low. Dopa can also suppress TSH
   and may be contributing to discrepancy of TSH and fT4.  Also consider
   secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially link edema,
   encephalopathy, depression, hypotension.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Worsening at this time also in light of low
   albumin. Question etiology from renal failure.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids
   - Monitor electrolytes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative. Suspicion is high.
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   - Resend PF4, serotonin release assay
   .
   # Recent PE/DVT
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   .
   # h/o C.Diff colitis.
   - Continue precaution
   - Continue antibiotics as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary
   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury, however was a relatively
   short period. Hyperammonemia may be contributing to component of
   hepatic encephalopathy, however ammonia was high prior to major decline
   in mental status. Possible hepatic dysfunction may prolong the time it
   takes to clear Versed. Abnormal thyroid function initially concerning
   for myxedema coma, but less likely given Thyroid Function that looks
   like sick euthyroid. Valproic level < 3; less likely ingestion. EEG
   with concern for anoxic brain injury. Very poor prognosis at this
   stage.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L). Large tidal
   volumes, low respiratory rate most likely secondary to central
   etiology.
   - Unlikely candidate for SBT, extubation at this time given diffuse
   encephalopathy
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body). Question whether hypoperfusion of skin may
   also lead to these changes. Nursing staff concerned regarding care of
   skin denudation.
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG and Silvadene
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   - Consider burn care consult pending neuro recommendations
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Previous
   concern for sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No
   documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed
   currently off. Unable to load outside hospital CT in our PACS system.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   - Low threshold for skin wound culture given concern for Pseudomonas
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  OSH thought
   c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low. Dopa can also suppress TSH
   and may be contributing to discrepancy of TSH and fT4.  Also consider
   secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially link edema,
   encephalopathy, depression, hypotension.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Worsening at this time also in light of low
   albumin. Question etiology from renal failure.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids
   - Monitor electrolytes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative. Suspicion is high.
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   - Resend PF4, serotonin release assay
   .
   # Recent PE/DVT
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   .
   # h/o C.Diff colitis.
   - Continue precaution
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   .
   # DM.
   - ISS

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe encephalopathy, bilateral pulmonary effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline.

The patient's current condition is critical, with a poor prognosis. He has a wide range of medical complications, including:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy is likely due to anoxic brain injury, with possible contributions from hyperammonemia, hepatic dysfunction, and myxedema coma.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection, and his respiratory rate is low, indicating a central etiology.
3. Rash: The patient has a desquamative rash, particularly over the extremities, which is likely related to anasarca and changing volume status.
4. Septic shock/hypotension: The patient has had previous concerns for sepsis and volume depletion, but his current hypotension is likely related to his underlying medical conditions.
5. Hyperammonemia: The patient's ammonia levels are elevated, with no clear reason for this finding.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's free T4 levels are low, but his TSH levels are normal, suggesting a possible pituitary or secondary hypothyroidism.
7. Anasarca: The patient has profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, and small pericardial effusion, likely related to his underlying medical conditions.
8. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's renal function has worsened, likely due to DM and ATN from hypotension.
9. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely related to his underlying medical conditions, including renal failure.
10. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is likely iatrogenic, related to free water losses from skin sloughing and medications.
11. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely related to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
12. Recent PE/DVT: The patient has a recent history of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Follow-up with neurology, endocrinology, and hematology recommendations.
2. Continue lactulose and albumin therapy.
3. Aggressive fluid repletion and electrolyte monitoring.
4. Hold heparin and start argatroban.
5. Continue antibiotics for C. difficile colitis.
6. Monitor for signs of sepsis and adjust antibiotics as necessary.
7. Consider burn care consult pending neurology recommendations.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings as necessary.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust fluid management as necessary.

Overall, the patient's prognosis is poor, and his treatment plan is focused on managing his complex medical conditions and improving his quality of life."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Spoke with dermatology in the AM and they recommended bariatric bed,
   silvadene. They will stop by in the PM - they recommend Aquacel AG.
   Bacitracin written for in case needed given near exhaustion of supply
   of Aquacel AG.
   - Nurses expressing concern about care and are suggesting possible
   transfer to burn unit.
   - Plastics asked to come in a.m. - will need to be consulted in a.m.
   - Neurology read head CT as reduced grey/white distinction in parietal
   cortex with effacement of gyri posteriorly. Read EEG as markedly
   reduced amplitude, without obvious slow activity - not really
   consistent with metabolic encephalopathy, nor PRES. Most consistent
   with anoxic injury. Wise to attempt correction of metabolic
   disturbance. Avoid sedation. Repeat CT or perform MRI on [**2-18**] (edema
   likely more evident then). No need for 24 hr EEG given no seizure
   activity.
   - 24 hr EEG started. Can possibly be stopped on [**2-18**].
   - Talked to wife, daughters and other family members. Described likely
   brain injury with poor prognosis. Discussed this as a decision point -
   i.e. neurologic injury will be something that we discuss with family in
   planning further goals. They have begun to speak about this. Mentioned
   importance of staying on top of serious skin condition while
   determining neurologic prognosis.

   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary
   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury, however was a relatively
   short period. Hyperammonemia may be contributing to component of
   hepatic encephalopathy, however ammonia was high prior to major decline
   in mental status. Possible hepatic dysfunction may prolong the time it
   takes to clear Versed. Abnormal thyroid function initially concerning
   for myxedema coma, but less likely given Thyroid Function that looks
   like sick euthyroid. Valproic level < 3; less likely ingestion. EEG
   with concern for anoxic brain injury. Very poor prognosis at this
   stage.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Family Meeting to discuss code status and goals of care.
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L). Large tidal
   volumes, low respiratory rate most likely secondary to central
   etiology.
   - Unlikely candidate for SBT, extubation at this time given diffuse
   encephalopathy
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body). Will hold on plastics input at this time.
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG and Silvadene
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   - Consider burn care consult pending neuro recommendations
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Previous
   concern for sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No
   documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed
   currently off.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   - Low threshold for skin wound culture given concern for Pseudomonas
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent
   sick euthyroid.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Worsening at this time also in light of low
   albumin. Question etiology from renal failure.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - D5W to replete free water deficit of 4.4 L.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids
   - Monitor electrolytes this PM
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative. Suspicion is high.
   - Hold heparin at this time

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Spoke with dermatology in the AM and they recommended bariatric bed,
   silvadene. They will stop by in the PM - they recommend Aquacel AG.
   Bacitracin written for in case needed given near exhaustion of supply
   of Aquacel AG.
   - Nurses expressing concern about care and are suggesting possible
   transfer to burn unit.
   - Plastics asked to come in a.m. - will need to be consulted in a.m.
   - Neurology read head CT as reduced grey/white distinction in parietal
   cortex with effacement of gyri posteriorly. Read EEG as markedly
   reduced amplitude, without obvious slow activity - not really
   consistent with metabolic encephalopathy, nor PRES. Most consistent
   with anoxic injury. Wise to attempt correction of metabolic
   disturbance. Avoid sedation. Repeat CT or perform MRI on [**2-18**] (edema
   likely more evident then). No need for 24 hr EEG given no seizure
   activity.
   - 24 hr EEG started. Can possibly be stopped on [**2-18**].
   - Talked to wife, daughters and other family members. Described likely
   brain injury with poor prognosis. Discussed this as a decision point -
   i.e. neurologic injury will be something that we discuss with family in
   planning further goals. They have begun to speak about this. Mentioned
   importance of staying on top of serious skin condition while
   determining neurologic prognosis.
   - Vancomcyin level 35.1 - continuing to hold
   - Still very hyper-Na/Cl lytes. Gave D51/2NS and stated water flushes
   of OG. Repeated lytes at 22:00 -

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe encephalopathy, anasarca, bilateral pulmonary effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline. The patient's condition has deteriorated significantly, and he is now at high risk of death.

The patient's encephalopathy is likely due to a combination of factors, including anoxic brain injury, hyperammonemia, and possible hepatic dysfunction. The hyperammonemia is unexpected and may be related to total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or another underlying condition. The patient's thyroid function is abnormal, but it is unclear whether this is due to hypothyroidism or sick euthyroid syndrome.

The patient has developed a severe rash, which is likely related to his anasarca and changing volume status. He has also developed septic shock, which is being managed with vancomycin and other antibiotics.

The patient's kidneys are failing, and he has developed acute on chronic renal insufficiency. He has also developed metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, and thrombocytopenia. The thrombocytopenia is likely due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and the patient is being treated with argatroban.

The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and he is receiving aggressive fluid and electrolyte repletion. He is also receiving nutrition support and prophylactic antibiotics. The patient's code status is full code, and his family has been updated on his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Anoxic brain injury: The patient's encephalopathy may be due to anoxic brain injury, which can lead to permanent brain damage and death.
2. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's hyperammonemia may be related to hepatic dysfunction, which can lead to further complications, including encephalopathy and death.
3. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention and treatment.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal insufficiency is a serious condition that requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent further complications.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be due to HIT, which can lead to bleeding complications and death.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention and treatment to prevent further complications.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is a serious condition that requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent further complications.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and he requires immediate attention and treatment to prevent further complications and improve his chances of survival."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Spoke with dermatology in the AM and they recommended bariatric bed,
   silvadene. They will stop by in the PM - they recommend Aquacel AG.
   Bacitracin written for in case needed given near exhaustion of supply
   of Aquacel AG.
   - Nurses expressing concern about care and are suggesting possible
   transfer to burn unit.
   - Plastics asked to come in a.m. - will need to be consulted in a.m.
   - Neurology read head CT as reduced grey/white distinction in parietal
   cortex with effacement of gyri posteriorly. Read EEG as markedly
   reduced amplitude, without obvious slow activity - not really
   consistent with metabolic encephalopathy, nor PRES. Most consistent
   with anoxic injury. Wise to attempt correction of metabolic
   disturbance. Avoid sedation. Repeat CT or perform MRI on [**2-18**] (edema
   likely more evident then). No need for 24 hr EEG given no seizure
   activity.
   - 24 hr EEG started. Can possibly be stopped on [**2-18**].
   - Talked to wife, daughters and other family members. Described likely
   brain injury with poor prognosis. Discussed this as a decision point -
   i.e. neurologic injury will be something that we discuss with family in
   planning further goals. They have begun to speak about this. Mentioned
   importance of staying on top of serious skin condition while
   determining neurologic prognosis.
   - Vancomcyin level 35.1 - continuing to hold

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary
   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury. This might explain
   components of renal failure [**2-26**] poor perfusion and skin sloughing also
   [**2-26**] poor perfusion. Hyperammonemia may be contributing to component of
   hepatic encephalopathy. Possible hepatic dysfunction may prolong the
   time it takes to clear Versed. Abnormal thyroid function initially
   concerning for myxedema coma, but less likely at this time. Would also
   consider seizure and infectious encephalitis. Valproic level < 3; less
   likely ingestion.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations; appreciate their input and
   assessment of poor activity on 20 minute EKG. This will determine how
   we manage dermatology, renal, burn care consults as below.
   - Continue 24 hour EEG
   - Consider MRI/LP if patient does not improve
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L).
   - Unlikely candidate for SBT, extubation at this time given diffuse
   encephalopathy
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body). Question whether hypoperfusion of skin may
   also lead to these changes. Nursing staff concerned regarding care of
   skin denudation.
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG and Silvadene
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   - Consider burn care consult pending neuro recommendations
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Previous
   concern for sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No
   documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed
   currently off. Unable to load outside hospital CT in our PACS system.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   - Low threshold for skin wound culture given concern for Pseudomonas
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  OSH thought
   c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low. Dopa can also suppress TSH
   and may be contributing to discrepancy of TSH and fT4.  Also consider
   secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially link edema,
   encephalopathy, depression, hypotension.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Worsening at this time also in light of low
   albumin. Question etiology from renal failure.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively

If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Spoke with dermatology in the AM and they recommended bariatric bed,
   silvadene. They will stop by in the PM - they recommend Aquacel AG.
   Bacitracin written for in case needed given near exhaustion of supply
   of Aquacel AG.
   - Nurses expressing concern about care and are suggesting possible
   transfer to burn unit.
   - Plastics asked to come in a.m. - will need to be consulted in a.m.
   - Neurology read head CT as reduced grey/white distinction in parietal
   cortex with effacement of gyri posteriorly. Read EEG as markedly
   reduced amplitude, without obvious slow activity - not really
   consistent with metabolic encephalopathy, nor PRES. Most consistent
   with anoxic injury. Wise to attempt correction of metabolic
   disturbance. Avoid sedation. Repeat CT or perform MRI on [**2-18**] (edema
   likely more evident then). No need for 24 hr EEG given no seizure
   activity.
   - 24 hr EEG started. Can possibly be stopped on [**2-18**].
   - Talked to wife, daughters and other family members. Described likely
   brain injury with poor prognosis. Discussed this as a decision point -
   i.e. neurologic injury will be something that we discuss with family in
   planning further goals. They have begun to speak about this. Mentioned
   importance of staying on top of serious skin condition while
   determining neurologic prognosis.
   - Vancomcyin level 35.1 - continuing to hold
   - Still very hyper-Na/Cl lytes. Gave D51/2NS and stated water flushes
   of OG. Repeated lytes at 22:00 -

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary
   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury. This might explain
   components of renal failure [**2-26**] poor perfusion and skin sloughing also
   [**2-26**] poor perfusion. Hyperammonemia may be contributing to component of
   hepatic encephalopathy. Possible hepatic dysfunction may prolong the
   time it takes to clear Versed. Abnormal thyroid function initially
   concerning for myxedema coma, but less likely at this time. Would also
   consider seizure and infectious encephalitis. Valproic level < 3; less
   likely ingestion.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations; appreciate their input and
   assessment of poor activity on 20 minute EKG. This will determine how
   we manage dermatology, renal, burn care consults as below.
   - Continue 24 hour EEG
   - Consider MRI/LP if patient does not improve
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L).
   - Unlikely candidate for SBT, extubation at this time given diffuse
   encephalopathy
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body). Question whether hypoperfusion of skin may
   also lead to these changes. Nursing staff concerned regarding care of
   skin denudation.
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG and Silvadene
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   - Consider burn care consult pending neuro recommendations
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Previous
   concern for sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No
   documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed
   currently off. Unable to load outside hospital CT in our PACS system.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   - Low threshold for skin wound culture given concern for Pseudomonas
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  OSH thought
   c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low. Dopa can also suppress TSH
   and may be contributing to discrepancy of TSH and fT4.  Also consider
   secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially link edema,
   encephalopathy, depression, hypotension.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Worsening at this time also in light of low
   albumin. Question etiology from renal failure.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids
   - Monitor electrolytes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative. Suspicion is high.
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   - Resend PF4, serotonin release assay
   .
   # Recent PE/DVT
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer, admitted to the ICU with severe encephalopathy, anasarca, bilateral pulmonary effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline. He has been transferred from another hospital and is currently intubated for airway protection.

The patient's condition is complex and multifaceted, with potential medical complications including:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy is likely related to anoxic brain injury, hypotension, and hyperammonemia. Neurology recommendations include attempting to correct metabolic disturbance, avoiding sedation, and repeating CT or performing MRI.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and unlikely to be a candidate for spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) or extubation at this time due to diffuse encephalopathy.
3. Rash: The patient has a desquamative rash, particularly over the extremities, which is likely related to anasarca and changing volume status. Dermatology recommendations include avoiding denuding more skin, using Aquacel AG and Silvadene, and calculating for insensible losses and repleting aggressively with fluids.
4. Septic shock/hypotension: The patient's hypotension has improved, but he remains at risk for sepsis and volume depletion. Cultures, including PICC tip, should be sent, and daily blood cultures should be performed.
5. Hyperammonemia: The patient's ammonia levels are elevated, and an endocrinologic workup is recommended to rule out hypothyroidism, multiple myeloma, and other causes.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's free T4 levels are low, but TSH is normal. Endocrinology recommendations include awaiting endocrinologic workup and deferring treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid.
7. Anasarca: The patient has profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, and small pericardial effusion. Nutrition support, including enteral nutrition, is recommended.
8. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's renal function has worsened, and he is at risk for further renal insults. Renal consult is recommended for consideration of hemodialysis pending neurology recommendations.
9. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely related to renal failure. Renal consult is recommended for consideration of hemodialysis.
10. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is likely iatrogenic and related to free water losses from skin sloughing and medications. Aggressive fluid repletion is recommended.
11. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely related to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Heparin should be held, and argatroban started.
12. Recent PE/DVT: The patient has a history of PE/DVT, and heparin should be held. Argatroban should be started.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 40 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He was admitted to the ICU with severe encephalopathy, respiratory failure, desquamating skin lesions, and renal failure.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Respiratory failure: He is intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a high MV partially due to metabolic acidosis and central etiology.
2. Encephalopathy: He has severe encephalopathy with no documented episodes of anoxia, and an EEG is planned to assess his neurologic function.
3. Hyperammonemia: His serum ammonia levels remain elevated, with unclear etiology.
4. Hypoalbunemia: His albumin levels are low, with unclear etiology.
5. Septic shock/hypotension: His blood pressure is stable off pressors, but he is still at risk for septic shock.
6. Rash: He has desquamative skin lesions, particularly over his extremities, and is being managed by the dermatology department.
7. Hypernatremia: His serum sodium levels are elevated, likely due to iatrogenic causes, including free water losses from skin sloughing, medications, and other factors.
8. Thrombocytopenia: His platelet count is low, with a negative PF4 test, and he is receiving argatroban for DVT prophylaxis.
9. Metabolic acidosis: He has ongoing large metabolic gap acidosis, which is contributing to his respiratory failure.
10. C.diff colitis: He is being treated with IV flagyl and oral vancomycin.

The patient's prognosis is grim due to his multiple organ failures, poor neurologic function, and lack of a unifying diagnosis. The healthcare team plans to have a frank discussion with the family about the poor prognosis and will need to make decisions about code status and disposition.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to his metabolic acidosis, septic shock, and other underlying conditions.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for septic shock due to his underlying conditions and the presence of C.diff colitis.
3. Kidney injury: His chronic kidney disease may worsen due to his current condition, and he may require dialysis.
4. Hepatic dysfunction: His liver function abnormalities may worsen, leading to further complications.
5. Skin breakdown: His desquamative skin lesions may worsen, leading to further skin breakdown and potential infections.
6. Cardiovascular instability: His blood pressure may fluctuate due to his septic shock, hypotension, and other underlying conditions.
7. Neurologic deterioration: His encephalopathy may worsen, leading to further neurologic deterioration and potential death."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5502**] is a 69 year-old man with sub-acute decline in mental
   status, anasarca that presented to [**Hospital 327**] Hospital with shortness of
   breath on [**2170-2-2**]. At that time his ammonia level was 223 and he was
   slurring speech and somewhat somnolent. He spent 10 days on the floor.
   During the admission he was transferred to the ICU, intubated and
   started on pressors. It appears that hypotension was an issue at that
   time. He became unresponsive at this time, we think, although this is
   not well documented. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] with desquamative skin
   and comatose.
   # Altered mental status
   Numerous contribitors are present, but the overall picture is that of
   vastly decreased cortical function, consistent with anoxic brain
   injury. There are no findings that argue against this specifically,
   although very ammonia, hypernatremia and low ceruloplasmin (5 at OSH)
   may be contributing. Release signs are present with prominent snout
   reflex and wincing on corneal. Non-localizing withdrawal of right arm
   on tactile stimulation.
   - Correct sodium and recheck ammonia
   - Stop all sedation and analgesic medications given no evidence of
   cortical function
   - Re-image depending on Neurology advice
   # Desquamating skin reaction
   Unclear etiology, but unifying diagnosis would be heartening.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   status, anasarca that presented to [**Hospital 327**] Hospital with shortness of
   breath on [**2170-2-2**]. At that time his ammonia level was 223 and he was
   slurring speech and somewhat somnolent. He spent 10 days on the floor.
   During the admission he was transferred to the ICU, intubated and
   started on pressors. It appears that hypotension was an issue at that
   time. He became unresponsive at this time, we think, although this is
   not well documented. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] with desquamative skin
   and comatose.
   # Altered mental status
   Numerous contribitors are present, but the overall picture is that of
   vastly decreased cortical function, consistent with anoxic brain
   injury. There are no findings that argue against this specifically,
   although very ammonia, hypernatremia and low ceruloplasmin (5 at OSH)
   may be contributing. Release signs are present with prominent snout
   reflex and wincing on corneal. Non-localizing withdrawal of right arm
   on tactile stimulation.
   - Correct sodium and recheck ammonia
   - Stop all sedation and analgesic medications given no evidence of
   cortical function
   - Re-image depending on Neurology advice
   # Desquamating skin reaction
   Unclear etiology, but unifying diagnosis would be heartening.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old man with a sub-acute decline in mental status, anasarca, and desquamating skin reaction. He was previously admitted to another hospital and transferred to the current ICU due to his condition.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Altered mental status: The patient is comatose, unresponsive, and unable to provide a history. His ammonia level is high, and he has hypernatremia and low ceruloplasmin levels, which may be contributing to his altered mental status.
* Desquamating skin reaction: The etiology of the desquamating skin reaction is unclear, but it may be related to his underlying condition.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has hypotension, with a blood pressure of 85/51 mmHg, and requires vasopressors to maintain his blood pressure.
* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His oxygen saturation is 99%, and his PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 370.
* Renal: The patient's urine output is low, and he requires fluid boluses to maintain his blood pressure.
* Hepatic: The patient's liver function tests are normal, but his ammonia level is high.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Seizures: The patient has had seizure-like activity, and his sodium level is normal. However, his ammonia level is high, which may increase the risk of seizures.
* Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection due to his immunocompromised state and the presence of invasive lines and devices.
* Sepsis: The patient's high fever and low blood pressure may indicate sepsis, which could be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's high ammonia level and liver dysfunction may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's hypotension and electrolyte imbalance may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
* Renal failure: The patient's low urine output and electrolyte imbalance may indicate renal failure, which could be life-threatening if not treated promptly.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Correcting his sodium and ammonia levels
* Stopping sedation and analgesic medications due to the lack of cortical function
* Re-imaging depending on neurology advice
* Maintaining his blood pressure with vasopressors
* Monitoring his urine output and electrolyte levels
* Providing supportive care for his respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal systems."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5502**] is a 69 year-old man with sub-acute decline in mental
   status, anasarca that presented to [**Hospital 327**] Hospital with shortness of
   breath on [**2170-2-2**]. At that time his ammonia level was 223 and he was
   slurring speech and somewhat somnolent. He spent 10 days on the floor.
   During the admission he was transferred to the ICU, intubated and
   started on pressors. It appears that hypotension was an issue at that
   time. He became unresponsive at this time, we think, although this is
   not well documented. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] with desquamative skin
   and comatose.
   # Altered mental status
   Numerous contribitors are present, but the overall picture is that of
   vastly decreased cortical function, consistent with anoxic brain
   injury. There are no findings that argue against this specifically,
   although very ammonia, hypernatremia and low ceruloplasmin (5 at OSH)
   may be contributing. Release signs are present with prominent snout
   reflex and wincing on corneal. Non-localizing withdrawal of right arm
   on tactile stimulation.
   - Correct sodium and recheck ammonia if possible
   - Stop all sedation and analgesic medications given no evidence of
   cortical function
   - Do not re-image for now
 unlikely helpful
   # Adventitious head movements
   Several muscle groups
 therefore cortical. Suggestive of seizure
   activity. Secondary to anoxic injury with some sparing of motorneurons
   versus edema and mass effect.
   - Dilantin 1 g then check in 4 hrs; 100 mg TID after
   - Imaging not indicated at the moment.
   # Desquamating skin reaction
   Unclear etiology, but unifying diagnosis would be heartening. Not
   likely [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 24**] Derm., who think that this is most likely secondary to
   previously dramatic anasarca and then microtrauma of being in bed.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics (started for
   pneumonia/sepsis/C.diff) given unable to apply antimicrobial
   - [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes
   - Appreciate Dermatology input
   - Treat as for burn
 copious fluids that respect hypernatremia and low
   bicarbonate
   # Respiratory Failure
   Agonal brainstem breathing, +/- liver breathing. Appears brainstem also
   affected based on reflexes/exam, thus likely neurologic. Also
   contributions by expansion acidosis.
   - Continue AC ventilation compatible with central rhythm
   # Goals of Care
   - Family meeting at 3 p.m. today.
   # Hypotension
   Clear loss of spinal reflexes and pupils small suggesting sympathetic
   output likely lower at brainstem or spinal level.
   - Continue fluid support as indicated by urine output (fluid balance
   not accurate due to cutaneous losses)
   - Low threshold to use pressors to stabilize while determining goals of
   care
   # Hyperammonemia
   Unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] late to present with metabolic disorder, although not
   impossible. No valproic acid recently. Has liver failure and pancreatic
   calcification of unknown etiology. Family claim little to no alcohol
   use.
   - Repeat ammonia level today
   # ESR
   Was 0 in OSH. This means no settling over one hour. Should therefore be
   suspicious for inflammatory causes of this presentation.
   - Repeat ESR
   # Hypothyroidism
   Likely sick euthyroid.
   # Hypernatremia
   Corrected quite quickly
 concerning. 5 mEq over nine hours maximal
   rate from labs. Unlikely problem in itself, but may be edema from
   anoxic brain injury and the two together may become significant.
   - [**Hospital1 **] labs and caution with solutions that contain no sodium. 1/2NS
   likely okay because of hypotonic skin losses
   # Anasarca
   Liver failure, low albumin and renal failure, now with large fluid
   shift and protein losses through skin. Will likely worsen.
   # Renal failure
   Creatinine now lower, but not baseline (2.2) suggesting that we are
   keeping up with fluid requirement.
   -Continue fluids
   # Liver failure
   Unclear cause. Fatty changes suggested by ultrasound. [**Month (only) 11**] be cause of
   low albumin, low ceruloplasmin
   # Low ceruloplasmin
   (5) in OSH. Not low enough for [**Location (un) 1729**]
s and metabolism likely disturbed
   with liver failure. Acerulopasminemia or Menkes do not fit. Would not
   explain present event.
   # PE/DVT
   - Continue intermittent argatroban (lowest dose deliverable too high,
   so will need to try 3 hours on 3 hours off today (previous minimum dose
   halving should be good estimation as first step.
   # C. diff.
   In OSH. Therefore flagyl and precautions.
   # Antibiotics
   Started for PNA/sepsis and now likely providing broad coverage for open
   skin.
   - Continue for now.
   # DM
   Well controlled at present.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5502**] is a 69 year-old man with sub-acute decline in mental
   status, anasarca that presented to [**Hospital 327**] Hospital with shortness of
   breath on [**2170-2-2**]. At that time his ammonia level was 223 and he was
   slurring speech and somewhat somnolent. He spent 10 days on the floor.
   During the admission he was transferred to the ICU, intubated and
   started on pressors. It appears that hypotension was an issue at that
   time. He became unresponsive at this time, we think, although this is
   not well documented. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] with desquamative skin
   and comatose.
   # Altered mental status
   Numerous contribitors are present, but the overall picture is that of
   vastly decreased cortical function, consistent with anoxic brain
   injury. There are no findings that argue against this specifically,
   although very ammonia, hypernatremia and low ceruloplasmin (5 at OSH)
   may be contributing. Release signs are present with prominent snout
   reflex and wincing on corneal. Non-localizing withdrawal of right arm
   on tactile stimulation.
   - Correct sodium and recheck ammonia if possible
   - Stop all sedation and analgesic medications given no evidence of
   cortical function
   - Do not re-image for now
 unlikely helpful
   # Adventitious head movements
   Several muscle groups
 therefore cortical. Suggestive of seizure
   activity. Secondary to anoxic injury with some sparing of motorneurons
   versus edema and mass effect.
   - Dilantin 1 g then check in 4 hrs; 100 mg TID after
   - Imaging not indicated at the moment.
   # Desquamating skin reaction
   Unclear etiology, but unifying diagnosis would be heartening. Not
   likely [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 24**] Derm., who think that this is most likely secondary to
   previously dramatic anasarca and then microtrauma of being in bed.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics (started for
   pneumonia/sepsis/C.diff) given unable to apply antimicrobial
   - [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes
   - Appreciate Dermatology input
   - Treat as for burn
 copious fluids that respect hypernatremia and low
   bicarbonate
   # Respiratory Failure
   Agonal brainstem breathing, +/- liver breathing. Appears brainstem also
   affected based on reflexes/exam, thus likely neurologic. Also
   contributions by expansion acidosis.
   - Continue AC ventilation compatible with central rhythm
   # Goals of Care
   - Family meeting at 3 p.m. today.
   # Hypotension
   Clear loss of spinal reflexes and pupils small suggesting sympathetic
   output likely lower at brainstem or spinal level.
   - Continue fluid support as indicated by urine output (fluid balance
   not accurate due to cutaneous losses)
   - Low threshold to use pressors to stabilize while determining goals of
   care
   # Hyperammonemia
   Unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] late to present with metabolic disorder, although not
   impossible. No valproic acid recently. Has liver failure and pancreatic
   calcification of unknown etiology. Family claim little to no alcohol
   use.
   - Repeat ammonia level today
   # ESR
   Was 0 in OSH. This means no settling over one hour. Should therefore be
   suspicious for inflammatory causes of this presentation.
   - Repeat ESR
   # Hypothyroidism
   Likely sick euthyroid.
   # Hypernatremia
   Corrected quite quickly
 concerning. 5 mEq over nine hours maximal
   rate from labs. Unlikely problem in itself, but may be edema from
   anoxic brain injury and the two together may become significant.
   - [**Hospital1 **] labs and caution with solutions that contain no sodium. 1/2NS
   likely okay because of hypotonic skin losses
   # Anasarca
   Liver failure, low albumin and renal failure, now with large fluid
   shift and protein losses through skin. Will likely worsen.
   # Renal failure
   Creatinine now lower, but not baseline (2.2) suggesting that we are
   keeping up with fluid requirement.
   -Continue fluids
   # Liver failure
   Unclear cause. Fatty changes suggested by ultrasound. [**Month (only) 11**] be cause of
   low albumin, low ceruloplasmin
   # Low ceruloplasmin
   (5) in OSH. Not low enough for [**Location (un) 1729**]
s and metabolism likely disturbed
   with liver failure. Acerulopasminemia or Menkes do not fit. Would not
   explain present event.
   # PE/DVT
   - Continue intermittent argatroban (lowest dose deliverable too high,
   so will need to try 3 hours on 3 hours off today (previous minimum dose
   halving should be good estimation as first step.
   # C. diff.
   In OSH. Therefore flagyl and precautions.
   # Antibiotics
   Started for PNA/sepsis and now likely providing broad coverage for open
   skin.
   - Continue for now.
   # DM
   Well controlled at present.

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications are identified:

1. Anoxic brain injury: The patient's altered mental status, decreased cortical function, and lack of reflexes suggest anoxic brain injury, which is a life-threatening condition.
2. Seizure activity: The patient's adventitious head movements and muscle spasms are indicative of seizure activity, which may be secondary to anoxic injury or other underlying conditions.
3. Desquamating skin reaction: The patient's desquamating skin reaction is unclear in etiology, but it may be secondary to anasarca, microtrauma, or other factors. This condition requires careful management to prevent infection and promote wound healing.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's agonal brainstem breathing and possible liver breathing suggest respiratory failure, which may be related to anoxic brain injury or other underlying conditions.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be related to anoxic brain injury, sepsis, or other underlying conditions, and requires careful management to prevent further decline.
6. Hyperammonemia: The patient's elevated ammonia levels may be related to liver failure or other underlying conditions, and requires close monitoring and management.
7. ESR elevation: The patient's elevated ESR may indicate an inflammatory response, which requires further evaluation and management.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's likely sick euthyroid state may require further evaluation and management to prevent complications.
9. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels may be related to anasarca, liver failure, or other underlying conditions, and requires careful management to prevent further complications.
10. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels suggest renal failure, which requires careful management to prevent further decline.
11. Liver failure: The patient's liver function test results suggest liver failure, which requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications.
12. Low ceruloplasmin: The patient's low ceruloplasmin levels may be related to liver failure or other underlying conditions, and requires further evaluation and management.

In terms of the patient's overall condition, the following are noted:

* The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further decline.
* The patient's altered mental status and decreased cortical function suggest anoxic brain injury, which is a life-threatening condition.
* The patient's respiratory failure, hypotension, and hyperammonemia require careful management to prevent further decline.
* The patient's desquamating skin reaction requires careful management to prevent infection and promote wound healing.
* The patient's liver failure and renal failure require close monitoring and management to prevent complications.

Based on this information, the patient's code status is currently full code, but this may need to be re-evaluated after the family meeting later today."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

* The patient is a 69-year-old male with chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer, admitted to the ICU with severe encephalopathy, respiratory failure, and diffuse skin sloughing.
* The patient has multiple organ failures, including respiratory, renal, and hepatic dysfunction, with no unifying diagnosis.
* He has a history of seizures, and his neurologic prognosis is poor.
* The patient is intubated for airway protection, and his respiratory status is worsening with increasing respiratory alkalosis.
* He has evidence of septic shock/hypotension, and his blood pressure is labile.
* The patient has a rash with desquamative changes, particularly over dependent areas, and is receiving wound care.
* He has hypoalbunemia, and the etiology is unclear.
* The patient has acute on chronic renal insufficiency, with a creatinine level of 3.2 mg/dL.
* He has hypernatremia, which has now corrected, and will have his fluid repletion adjusted accordingly.
* The patient has thrombocytopenia, and argatroban is being held due to supratherapeutic PTT levels.
* He has C. diff colitis, and is receiving IV flagyl and oral vancomycin.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further deterioration of the patient's respiratory status, leading to respiratory failure or ARDS.
* Progression of the patient's encephalopathy, leading to increased risk of seizures, coma, or death.
* Development of sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's underlying infections or organ dysfunction.
* Complications related to the patient's chronic kidney disease, such as uremic encephalopathy or electrolyte imbalances.
* Worsening of the patient's skin condition, leading to increased risk of infection or sepsis.
* Complications related to the patient's underlying cancers, such as bleeding or tumor lysis syndrome.

Given the patient's critical illness and multiple organ failures, his prognosis is grim, and a family meeting is planned to discuss goals of care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer, who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, encephalopathy, and diffuse skin sloughing. The patient has multiple organ failures, including respiratory, renal, and cardiovascular dysfunction. The patient's neurological status is poor, with evidence of seizures and altered mental status.

The patient's laboratory results show abnormal liver function, hypoalbuminemia, and hypernatremia. The patient has a history of septic shock, hypotension, and thrombocytopenia, and is currently receiving antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and anticoagulants.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with mechanical ventilation in place, and the patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's skin integrity is compromised, with desquamative rash and wound care issues.

The patient's prognosis is grim, with multiple organ failures and poor neurological function. The patient's family has expressed their wish to transition his care to comfort measures only, and the patient expired at around 5:30 PM.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory status is critical, and the risk of developing VAP is high.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of septic shock and hypotension, and the risk of developing sepsis is high.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and the risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiovascular status is compromised, and the risk of developing cardiovascular instability is high.
5. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status is poor, and the risk of neurological deterioration is high.
6. Wound complications: The patient's skin integrity is compromised, and the risk of developing wound complications, such as infection or dehiscence, is high.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and the risk of developing hyperglycemia is high.
8. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient's albumin levels are low, and the risk of developing hypoalbuminemia is high.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and the risk of developing thrombocytopenia is high.
10. C. difficile colitis: The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis, and the risk of developing recurrent episodes is high."
