 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   A/P: 85M with CAD, CHF EF 20%, VT s/p ICD, ESRD on HD, p/w dysphagia.
   .
   # Dysphagia:  This is most likely [**12-24**] obstruction and food impaction in
   esophagus.  Pt is comfortable and handling his secretions; however,
   prolonged food impaction carries a significant risk of eroding the
   esophagus and may cause rupture.
   - GI aware, plan for upper endoscopy
   - NPO
   - given elevated INR will  give FFP peri-operatively
   - obtain T& S, crossmatch 2 units
   .
   # Pre-procedure risk evaluation: Given the food impaction and known
   prior aspiration/dysphagia (Dysphagia Outcome Severity Scale (DOSS)
   rating of 4, moderate dysphagia), this patient is at particular risk of
   aspiration and will need intubation. As far as I can see from OMR, the
   patient has not been formally diagnosed with primary pulmonary disease.
   He was a long-term smoker, quit 20 years ago. He did have PFT's in [**2137**]
   w/o any evidence of obstructive disease but showing mild restrictive
   ventilatory defect and reduced diffusing capacity suggesting an
   interstitial process and possible amiodarone toxicity. He has chronic
   effusions and is on 2L home O2 suggestive of underlying lung disease-
   both of which may complicate extubation.  However, he has never had
   symptoms from pulmonary disease and hospitalizations for respiratory
   distress have been largely related to aspiration and CHF.  In addition
   to the aspiration risk, patient has multiple cardiac comorbidities that
   place him at risk for peri-procedural MI. Having said that, endsocopy
   is a low risk procedure itself. At this time, he appears to be stable
   and at baseline from a cardiac and pulmonary perspective with stable
   effusion, no CHF exacerbation and no new hypoxia. Although the patient
   is moderate/high risk, the benefit of removing a food impaction
   urgently appears to out weight the risk of  aspiration and difficulty
   extubating.
   - proceed with EGD
   - ideally would give long acting perioperative beta-blocker but can
   consider short acting BB instead given NPO status.
   - discuss with anesthesia and family risk of difficulty with extubation
   .
   # ESRD on HD:
   - contact renal for HD
   .
   # CAD s/p multiple stents:  No active angina.  has been several years
   since the last stent, the patient has not been taking the aspirin since
   [**11-16**]
   - restart meds when can take PO
   .
   # H/o VT s/p ICD:
   - restart Mexiletine and BB when able to take PO's
   .
   # Chronic systolic HF:  currently euvolemic
   - restart metoprolol and lisinopril when able to take PO's
   .
   # anemia:  hct 34.7, has baseline anemia
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - hold  levothyroxine  until taking Po
   .
   # Factor V leiden: INR supratherapeutic
   - hold coumadin and trend INR
   -                      give FFP peri-procedure, but will not reverse
   with vit K

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, an 85-year-old male, is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation due to a food impaction in the esophagus. He has a history of chronic conditions, including coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and a history of ventricular tachycardia with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator. He is also anemic and has hypothyroidism. The patient's current condition is stable, with normal vital signs and no signs of respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration: The patient's food impaction and known aspiration history make him at high risk for aspiration during endoscopy and intubation.
2. Esophageal Rupture: Prolonged food impaction can lead to erosion of the esophagus and potential rupture.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac history and current medications make him at risk for peri-procedural myocardial infarction.
4. Respiratory Complications: The patient's chronic lung disease and pulmonary effusions may complicate extubation and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen during the procedure and recovery period.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may require adjustment of his thyroid medication during the procedure and recovery period.
7. Factor V Leiden: The patient's supratherapeutic INR requires close monitoring and potential reversal with FFP during the procedure.

Plan:

1. Proceed with endoscopy to remove the food impaction.
2. Give FFP peri-procedure to reverse the supratherapeutic INR.
3. Restart medications as soon as possible, including aspirin, metoprolol, lisinopril, and levothyroxine.
4. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely during and after the procedure.
5. Consider short-acting beta-blocker instead of long-acting beta-blocker due to the patient's NPO status.
6. Discuss the risk of difficulty with extubation with the anesthesia team and family.
7. Contact renal services for hemodialysis as needed.
8. Restart Mexiletine and beta-blocker when the patient can take PO medications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 85-year-old male with a chief complaint of food impaction, which was successfully removed through endoscopy. The patient was intubated and ventilated, and is currently on assist-control ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°F, heart rate of 80-84 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 99/45 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 99% on 40% FiO2.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated creatinine level of 5.4 mg/dL. His blood glucose level is well-controlled.

The patient's physical examination is notable for an endotracheal tube in place, and he is sedated and unable to provide a history. His cardiovascular examination is normal, with a regular sinus rhythm and no murmurs. His respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds, and his abdominal examination is normal.

The patient has several underlying medical conditions, including chronic systolic heart failure, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease. He is also taking several medications, including warfarin, metoprolol, lisinopril, and levothyroxine.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient's intubation and ventilation may lead to respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, respiratory failure, and lung injury.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's underlying coronary artery disease and chronic systolic heart failure may lead to cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
3. Renal complications: The patient's end-stage renal disease may lead to renal complications such as acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's dysphagia and food impaction may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and bowel obstruction.
5. Infection: The patient's underlying medical conditions and prolonged hospitalization may increase his risk of developing infections such as pneumonia, sepsis, and urinary tract infections.

Based on the patient's condition, I recommend the following:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Adjust his medications as needed to ensure that he is receiving the appropriate treatment for his underlying medical conditions.
3. Monitor the patient for signs of respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, and infectious complications.
4. Consider performing a swallowing evaluation to assess the patient's ability to swallow safely.
5. Plan for the patient's discharge from the ICU and transfer to a step-down unit or a rehabilitation facility as appropriate."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 85-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, VT s/p ICD, ESRD on HD, and multiple medical conditions. The patient was recently hospitalized for food impaction and underwent an EGD, which was successful. The patient was extubated without sequelae and was able to tolerate a clear liquid diet, but reported a new cough that is loose and occasionally productive.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 37.4°C, Tcurrent of 36.1°C, HR of 80 bpm, BP of 107/47 mmHg, RR of 21 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 99%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 496 mL, with a total in of 480 mL and a total out of 0 mL.

The patient's physical examination reveals right posterior lung field crackles to mid-lung, left basilar crackles, and soft, non-tender abdomen. The patient's neurological examination shows he is alert and oriented x3.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 4.9-6.0 K/uL
* Hct: 29.3-30.9%
* Plt: 137-166 K/uL
* Cr: 5.4-3.2 mg/dL
* Glucose: 58-92 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 30.6/47.4/3.1, Ca++: 8.4 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.6 mg/dL, PO4: 3.1 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Dysphagia: The patient is to follow up with GI in 2 weeks for a clinic visit followed by possible repeat EGD. The patient is to take PPI daily.
* Cough: The patient is to have a CXR prior to discharge to assure that he has not developed imaging evidence of pneumonia since pre-EGD CXR.
* ESRD on HD: The patient was dialyzed yesterday.
* CAD s/p multiple stents: The patient has no active angina and has not been taking aspirin since [**11-16**]. Aspirin was restarted yesterday.
* H/o VT s/p ICD: The patient is to continue Mexiletine and BB.
* Chronic systolic HF: The patient is to continue metoprolol and lisinopril.
* Anemia: The patient's Hct is 30.9%, which is within normal limits.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient is to continue levothyroxine.
* Factor V leiden: The patient's INR is supratherapeutic to 3.1 today, and Coumadin is to be held today and have repeat INR as an outpatient tomorrow.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pneumonia: The patient's cough is loose and occasionally productive, and he may be at risk for developing pneumonia.
* Bleeding: The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, and he is at risk for bleeding.
* Thrombosis: The patient is on systemic anticoagulation with Coumadin, and he is at risk for developing thrombosis.
* Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infection due to his compromised immune system and his history of chronic medical conditions.
* Malnutrition: The patient's diet is restricted due to his dysphagia, and he may be at risk for malnutrition.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of CAD and CHF, and he may be at risk for developing cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure."

Summary:

The patient, an 85-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, VT s/p ICD, ESRD on HD, and multiple medical comorbidities, was extubated from invasive ventilation and is currently on nasal cannula oxygen therapy. He has been restarted on most of his home medications, with the exception of warfarin due to an elevated INR. The patient has been tolerating a clear diet and has had no cough or nausea/vomiting. He has been dialyzed by nephrology and has had an EGD procedure to remove a food impaction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is at risk for respiratory complications due to his history of CAD, CHF, and VT s/p ICD, which can lead to decreased lung function and increased risk of pneumonia.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of CAD and CHF increases his risk for cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.
3. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of dysphagia and food impaction increases his risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration pneumonia, and may require further evaluation and management.
4. Renal Complications: The patient's history of ESRD on HD increases his risk for renal complications, such as acute kidney injury, and requires close monitoring of his renal function.
5. Bleeding Complications: The patient's history of Factor V Leiden and supratherapeutic INR increases his risk for bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
6. Anemia: The patient's history of anemia and baseline Hct of 34.7% may require further evaluation and management to address his anemia.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism requires close monitoring of his thyroid function and may require further evaluation and management to address his hypothyroidism.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical comorbidities to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal care."
