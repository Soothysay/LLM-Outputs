You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient continues to experience diffuse bone pain and persistent fatigue. The patient's hypotension persists, requiring continued use of levophed and subsequent change to neo. The patient's wide complex tachycardia is likely ventricular tachycardia (VT) and is being monitored. The patient's random cortisol level is 23.4, and LFTs are elevated, mainly transaminases, with a tiny bit of elevation in alk phos and normal t.bili. The patient's lactate has normalized to 2.0.

The patient's echo shows moderate LV diastolic dysfunction, preserved LV function, small pericardial effusion, moderate TR, mild MR, and trace AR. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted changes. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 37.1°C, Tcurrent of 36.2°C, HR of 67 bpm, BP of 104/51 mmHg, RR of 21 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 93%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC, Hct, and Plt, with normal Cr and TropT. The patient's other labs are abnormal, including PT, PTT, INR, CK, CKMB, Troponin-T, Glucose, and Lactic Acid. The patient's assessment and plan include hypotension, hypercalcemia, coagulopathy, renal failure, end-stage renal disease, multiple myeloma, respiratory failure, acute alteration in nutrition, and ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Hypotension: shock, organ failure, and death.
2. Hypercalcemia: cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and renal failure.
3. Coagulopathy: bleeding, thrombosis, and organ failure.
4. Renal failure: end-stage renal disease, electrolyte imbalances, and death.
5. Multiple myeloma: infections, bleeding, and organ failure.
6. Respiratory failure: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory arrest, and death.
7. Alteration in nutrition: malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and organ failure.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment plans accordingly to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient's blood pressure is still unstable, and she is requiring levophed to maintain her blood pressure near her baseline. This is a concern, as hypotension can lead to end-organ ischemia and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. NSTEMI: The patient's cardiac biomarkers are elevated, and she is experiencing sustained wide complex tachycardia. This is concerning for a potential NSTEMI, which could lead to cardiac complications.
3. Elevated Transaminases: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which could be a sign of liver damage or dysfunction. This could be related to her underlying disease, such as multiple myeloma, or a complication of her treatment.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient has a history of hypercalcemia, which is a common complication of multiple myeloma. This could lead to a range of complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, kidney damage, and bone pain.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient has chronic oxygen requirements due to amyloidosis involvement of the lungs, and she has a history of PEs. This increases her risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia and respiratory failure.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of supratherapeutic INR and is at risk for bleeding complications. This could be exacerbated by her underlying disease and treatment.
7. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on hemodialysis. This increases her risk of renal complications, such as acute kidney injury and electrolyte imbalances.
8. Contrast Infiltration: The patient has had contrast infiltration in her SC tissues, which could lead to complications such as tissue necrosis and scarring.
9. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which could lead to a range of complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and neurological symptoms.

In terms of the patient's overall condition, she is still experiencing diffuse bone pain, persistent fatigue, and hypotension. Her cardiac biomarkers are elevated, and she is requiring levophed to maintain her blood pressure. She has a range of underlying medical conditions, including multiple myeloma, ESRD, and amyloidosis, which increase her risk of complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with multiple myeloma, systemic amyloidosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. She was admitted to the ICU for recurrent hypercalcemia and supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR). On presentation, she had diffuse bone pain, persistent fatigue, and was hypotensive, requiring levophed support. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) showed wide complex tachycardia, likely ventricular tachycardia (VT) given the absence of history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or atrial fibrillation (a. fib). She was treated with pamidronate and calcitonin for hypercalcemia and has been receiving hemodialysis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T, likely due to demand from hypotension and probable previously unrecognized or asymptomatic tachyarrhythmias. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, possibly due to shock liver. She has chronic oxygen requirement due to amyloidosis involvement of the lungs and has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and pleurodesis.

The patient's medical complications and potential risks include:

1. Hypotension/shock: The patient's hypotension is refractory to fluid resuscitation, and her lactate levels are elevated, suggesting end-organ ischemia.
2. Wide complex tachycardia: The patient's VT is likely due to cardiac amyloid and known diastolic dysfunction, and she has been treated with amiodarone.
3. NSTEMI: The patient's troponin-T levels are elevated, and she has a history of cardiac amyloid, which may be contributing to her cardiac biomarkers.
4. Elevated transaminases: The patient's LFTs are elevated, possibly due to shock liver.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia is likely due to her multiple myeloma and amyloidosis.
6. Increasing oxygen requirement: The patient's chronic oxygen requirement may be increasing due to her underlying lung disease.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's supratherapeutic INR may be contributing to her bleeding risk.
8. Positive cardiac biomarkers: The patient's elevated troponin-T and CK levels suggest cardiac injury.
9. Multiple myeloma: The patient's recurrent multiple myeloma is contributing to her hypercalcemia and amyloidosis.
10. ESRD on HD: The patient's end-stage renal disease is requiring hemodialysis, and her renal function is deteriorating.

Based on these findings, I recommend the following:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and adjust her fluid management accordingly.
2. Continue to treat her VT with amiodarone and monitor her cardiac biomarkers.
3. Continue to manage her hypercalcemia with pamidronate and calcitonin.
4. Continue to monitor her LFTs and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
5. Wean her oxygen therapy as tolerated to home level 2-3 L.
6. Hold Coumadin and give vitamin K 1 dose to correct her coagulopathy.
7. Continue ROMI protocol and monitor her cardiac biomarkers.
8. Refer the patient to hematology and oncology for further management of her multiple myeloma.
9. Continue to manage her ESRD with hemodialysis and monitor her renal function.
10. Consider referring the patient to a cardio-oncologist for further management of her cardiac complications."

   # Hypotension/shock:  Patient with baseline SBPs in the 70s-80s,
   however documented noninvasive SBPs as low as the 50s in ED and in ICU
   with e/o end organ ischemia given elevated lactate, newly elevated
   transaminases, and elevated trop.  Did provide h/o poor PO and
   continued aggressive volume off at HD, but hypotension unresponsive to
   fluid back.  Other possible cause include underlying pneumonia (good
   specimen sputum is showing GPCs); she is without other clear source of
   infection currently.  Cardiogenic is certainly possible given h/o

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with multiple myeloma, systemic amyloidosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. She has been hospitalized for hypercalcemia and supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR). She is currently in the ICU due to persistent hypotension, wide complex tachycardia, and elevated troponin levels. Her laboratory results show elevated lactate, transaminases, and troponin levels, as well as a slightly elevated white blood cell count.

Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient's hypotension is unresponsive to fluid resuscitation, and she has evidence of end-organ ischemia. Possible causes include cardiogenic shock, septic shock, or hypovolemic shock.
2. Wide Complex Tachycardia: The patient's wide complex tachycardia is likely ventricular tachycardia (VT) given the absence of known history of supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation. The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) shows AV dissociation, which is consistent with VT.
3. Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient's troponin levels are elevated, and her ECG shows changes consistent with myocardial infarction. However, her cardiac enzymes are not significantly elevated, and her ECG does not show significant ST segment elevation.
4. Elevated Transaminases: The patient's transaminases are elevated, which may be due to shock liver or other causes.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia is likely due to her multiple myeloma and amyloidosis.
6. Increasing Oxygen Requirement: The patient's oxygen requirement is increasing, which may be due to her chronic lung disease and possible pneumonia.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, which may be due to her Coumadin therapy or other factors.
8. Bone Pain: The patient's bone pain is likely due to her multiple myeloma and bisphosphonate therapy.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and heart rate.
2. Continue to administer levophed and neo to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 50-55 mmHg.
3. Monitor the patient's troponin levels and cardiac enzymes to assess for possible myocardial infarction.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's transaminases and liver function tests to assess for possible liver damage.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolytes and renal function to assess for possible electrolyte imbalances and kidney damage.
6. Continue to administer bisphosphonate therapy to manage the patient's hypercalcemia.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygen requirement and adjust therapy as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulation status and adjust therapy as needed.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's bone pain and adjust therapy as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   64yo woman with multiple myeloma, s/p allogeneic transplant [**2143**] with
   recurrent disease and with systemic amyloidosis(cardiac), ESRD on
   hemodialysis s/p recent hospitalization for hypercalcemia and
   supratherapeutic INR who represents for the same issues as well as
   hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Patient with baseline SBPs in the 70s-80s,
   however documented noninvasive SBPs as low as the 50s in ED and in ICU
   with e/o end organ ischemia given elevated lactate, newly elevated
   transaminases, and elevated trop.  Did provide h/o poor PO and
   continued aggressive volume off at HD, but hypotension unresponsive to
   fluid back.  Other possible cause include underlying pneumonia (good
   specimen sputum is showing GPCs); she is without other clear source of
   infection currently.  Cardiogenic is certainly possible given h/o
   cardiac amyloid and known diastolic dysfunction as well as in setting
   of MI, however echo largely unchanged from prior and without
   significant WMA. Random cortisol appropriately elevated.  Levophed
   changed to neo following wide complex tachycardia.
   - continue neo for now with goal MAPs 50-55
   - monitor on tele
   - continue levofloxacin/vanco
   - checking central venous O2 sat
   .
   # Wide complex tachycardia:  Does not have known h/o SVT, a.
   fib/flutter to suggest SVT with aberrancy.  Given known cardiac
   amyloid, suspect VT and EKG with e/o AV dissociation.  It was slightly
   irregular, but ?
warm up
 phase of VT.  Experienced only small dip in
   BP during episode and was asymptomatic.
   - amiodarone loading now given second episode of sustained stable
   (probable) VT
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Trop continues to rise (negative CK, -MB).  Suspect in the
   setting of demand from hypotension and probable previously
   unrecognized/asymptomatic tachyarrhythmias.  Think less likely VT is
   d/t ischemia and ACS/acute plaque rupture.  TTE yesterday without noted
   WMA.
   -Continue aspirin
   -Continue to trend CEs awaiting trop peak
   .
   # Elevated transaminases:  Continue to rise and suspect d/t shock
   liver.  AP only very mildly elevated and t.bili normal so no e/o
   cholestatic process.  She is also without abdominal pain so as not to
   suggest cholangitis or cholecystitis as underlying cause of infection.
   - continue to monitor LFTs
   .
   # Hypercalcemia: in the setting of diffuse, recurrent MM c/b
   amyloidosis.  Improved s/p IV pamidronate, calcitonin.
   -continue HD
   -continue to monitor levels
   .
   # Increasing oxygen requirement: has chronic oxygen requirement due to
   amyloidosis involvement of the lungs. Also has h/o PEs and is s/p
   pleurodesis. CTA was negative for PE.   Did have some increased
   perihilar opacity on right on CT chest when compared with prior and,
   although not producing much sputum, did produce good specimen which
   shows GPCs.
   -wean oxygen as tolerated to home level 2-3 L
   -continue vanco/zosyn pending senses on GPCs
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Pt initially presented supratherapeutic at prior
   admission, had been subtherapeutic on discharge, Coumadin dose was
   increased upon last discharge. She has an extensive h/o thromobosis of
   unclear etiology.  INR supratherapeutic again on this presentation,
   improved after 1mg PO vitamin K x1.
   - hold coumadin, continue to monitor coags
   .
   # Multiple myeloma: Recurrent; c/b hypercalcemia and amyloidosis
   - heme/onc involved, appreciate their input
   - Continue decadron 20mg daily x5 days (day 1 is [**1-16**])
   - d/w hem/onc possibility of revlimid causing any of the presenting
   issues as above; otherwise plan per hem/onc is to restart revlimid
   .
   # Bone pain:  Given time course, most likely in the setting of
   bisphosphonate during last admission, now s/p additional dose on this
   presentation.  She remains quite uncomfortable.
   - morphine IV prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient's hypotension is unresponsive to fluid resuscitation, and there is concern about end-organ ischemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause, which may include cardiogenic shock, septic shock, or hypovolemic shock.
2. Wide Complex Tachycardia: The patient's wide complex tachycardia is likely ventricular tachycardia (VT) given the absence of a history of supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation. The patient's cardiac amyloidosis and diastolic dysfunction may contribute to the development of VT.
3. NSTEMI: The patient's troponin levels continue to rise, suggesting possible myocardial infarction. However, the lack of significant wall motion abnormality on echocardiogram and the absence of chest pain suggest that the infarction may be non-ST elevation.
4. Elevated Transaminases: The patient's transaminases are elevated, which may be due to shock liver or cardiac amyloidosis.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia is likely related to her multiple myeloma and amyloidosis. Further monitoring is needed to ensure that the patient's calcium levels remain within a safe range.
6. Increasing Oxygen Requirement: The patient's oxygen requirement is increasing, which may be due to her chronic lung disease or possible pneumonia.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is supratherapeutic, which may be due to her Coumadin therapy. Further monitoring is needed to ensure that her coagulation status is within a safe range.
8. Multiple Myeloma: The patient's recurrent multiple myeloma is likely contributing to her hypercalcemia and amyloidosis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the best course of treatment for her multiple myeloma.
9. Bone Pain: The patient's bone pain is likely related to her multiple myeloma and may be exacerbated by her hypercalcemia.
10. ESRD on HD: The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is being managed with hemodialysis, which is necessary due to her inability to produce urine.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
2. Continue to administer levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 50-55 mmHg.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's troponin levels and consider further evaluation for possible NSTEMI.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's transaminases and consider further evaluation for possible shock liver or cardiac amyloidosis.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's calcium levels and adjust therapy as necessary to ensure that the patient's calcium levels remain within a safe range.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygen requirement and consider further evaluation for possible pneumonia.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulation status and adjust therapy as necessary to ensure that the patient's INR remains within a safe range.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's multiple myeloma and consider further evaluation and treatment as necessary.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's bone pain and consider further evaluation and treatment as necessary.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's ESRD and adjust therapy as necessary to ensure that the patient's kidney function remains stable."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a history of multiple myeloma (MM) and amyloidosis who is critically ill in the ICU. She presents with hypotension, dyspnea, and refractory hypercalcemia. She has undergone an allo-transplant in 2143 and has a recent history of NSTEMI, transaminitis, and recurrent hypercalcemia. Her current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, increased oxygen requirement, and perihilar consolidation on chest CT with a positive sputum culture, suggesting new pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.1°C (98.8°F)
* Heart rate: 77 bpm (65-77)
* Blood pressure: 104/53 mmHg (66-137/63-69)
* Respiratory rate: 30 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 95%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: No acute distress
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, present radial and digital pulses
* Respiratory/Chest: Clear breath sounds, resonant percussion
* Extremities: Absent right and left pedal pulses
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, oriented to person, place, and time, purposeful movement, and normal tone

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.8 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 6.4 K/uL
* Platelet count: 263 K/uL
* Creatinine: 4.2 mg/dL
* Calcium: 11.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.4 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 6.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.95 ng/mL

The patient's ECG shows ventricular tachycardia.

Potential medical complications:

* Pneumonia: The patient's chest CT shows perihilar consolidation, and the sputum culture is positive, suggesting new pneumonia.
* Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen requirement has increased, and her SpO2 is 95%, indicating hypoxemic respiratory failure.
* Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium level is 11.7 mg/dL, which is above the normal range and may be contributing to her hypotension and respiratory failure.
* NSTEMI: The patient has a recent history of NSTEMI, which may be contributing to her hypotension and respiratory failure.
* Amyloidosis: The patient's amyloidosis may be contributing to her hypotension, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrhythmias.
* Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's cortisol level is 23, which is below the normal range, and may be contributing to her hypotension.
* Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's ECG shows ventricular tachycardia, which may be contributing to her hypotension and respiratory failure.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Increasing phenylephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 55
* Titrating neo to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 55
* Monitoring cv02
* Keeping volume even with hemodialysis
* Starting amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia
* Continuing vancomycin and levofloxacin pending final cultures
* Managing hypercalcemia
* Managing hypoxemic respiratory failure
* Managing NSTEMI
* Managing amyloidosis
* Managing adrenal insufficiency"

   64 year old woman with MM and [**Doctor Last Name **] amyloid presents with hypotension and
   increased O2 requirement. Increase in perihilar consolidation on chest
   CT as well as
   positive sputum culture so suspect new pneumonia and decreased SVR.
   Titrate neo to MAP of 55, check cv02. TTE yesterday with relatively
   little change, but
   with stable ventircular arrythmia today. No evidence of ischemic
   chagnes on admission EKG so suspect etiology is amyloid. Will start
   amio. Continue vanc/levo pending
   final cultures. Further plans as per resident note.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a history of multiple myeloma (MM) and [**Doctor Last Name **] amyloid, who presents with sub-acute progressive dyspnea, hypotension, and refractory hypercalcemia. She has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of pneumonia and decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR).

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.2°C (97.1°F)
* Heart rate: 77 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 104/53 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 95%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient has a PICC line inserted and is receiving phenylephrine infusion at a rate of 1.8 mcg/Kg/min. She is also receiving antibiotics, including levofloxacin, and other medications such as vanc and levo.

The patient's lab results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.8 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 6.4 K/uL
* Platelet count: 263 K/uL
* Creatinine: 4.2 mg/dL
* Calcium: 11.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.4 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 6.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.95 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 2.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.1 g/dL
* LDH: 773 IU/L

The patient's ECG shows ventricular tachycardia (VT) on this morning's EKG, and the assessment suggests that the etiology of VT is likely due to amyloid.

The plan for the patient includes titrating norepinephrine to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 55, checking central venous oxygen saturation (cv02), and starting amiodarone. The patient will also continue to receive vancomycin and levofloxacin pending final cultures.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a new pneumonia, which can lead to further respiratory distress and complications.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's VT can lead to cardiac arrest and death if not properly managed.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient's refractory hypercalcemia can lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, kidney damage, and seizures.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest potential kidney damage, which can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
5. Infection: The patient's positive sputum culture suggests the possibility of a secondary infection, which can lead to further complications such as sepsis and multi-organ failure."

Summary:

The patient is a 61.7 kg individual admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and acute respiratory failure. The patient is currently receiving dialysis and has been treated with vancomycin and levofloxacin for infections. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, and blood pressure of 93/46 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes high-flow nebulization with oxygen, and their SpO2 is 94%. The patient's laboratory results show evidence of coagulopathy, hypercalcemia, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's history of infections and coagulopathy increases their risk of developing sepsis.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's use of amiodarone and phenylephrine for arrhythmias increases their risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure and hypercalcemia increase their risk of developing respiratory failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD and hypercalcemia increase their risk of developing acute kidney injury.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's multiple myeloma and hypercalcemia increase their risk of developing neurological complications such as seizures or stroke.
6. Infection: The patient's use of central lines and dialysis catheter increases their risk of developing central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) or catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs).
7. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy increases their risk of developing bleeding complications.
8. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia increases their risk of developing hypocalcemia if calcium levels are not carefully monitored and managed.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to prevent or promptly address these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   64yo woman with multiple myeloma, s/p allogeneic transplant [**2143**] with
   recurrent disease and with systemic amyloidosis(cardiac), ESRD on
   hemodialysis s/p recent hospitalization for hypercalcemia and
   supratherapeutic INR who represents for the same issues as well as
   hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Patient with baseline SBPs in the 70s-80s,
   however documented noninvasive SBPs as low as the 50s in ED and in ICU
   with e/o end organ ischemia given elevated lactate, newly elevated
   transaminases, and elevated trop.  Did provide h/o poor PO and
   continued aggressive volume off at HD, but hypotension unresponsive to
   fluid back.  Other possible cause include underlying pneumonia (good
   specimen sputum is showing GPCs); she is without other clear source of
   infection currently.  Cardiogenic is certainly possible given h/o
   cardiac amyloid and known diastolic dysfunction as well as in setting
   of MI, however echo largely unchanged from prior and without
   significant WMA. Random cortisol appropriately elevated.  Levophed
   changed to neo following wide complex tachycardia.
   - continue neo for now with goal MAPs 50-55
   - monitor on tele
   - continue levofloxacin/vanco
   - checking central venous O2 sat
   .
   # Wide complex tachycardia:  Does not have known h/o SVT, a.
   fib/flutter to suggest SVT with aberrancy.  Given known cardiac
   amyloid, suspect VT and EKG with e/o AV dissociation.  It was slightly
   irregular, but ?
warm up
 phase of VT.  Experienced only small dip in
   BP during episode and was asymptomatic.
   - amiodarone loading now given second episode of sustained stable
   (probable) VT
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Trop continues to rise (negative CK, -MB).  Suspect in the
   setting of demand from hypotension and probable previously
   unrecognized/asymptomatic tachyarrhythmias.  Think less likely VT is
   d/t ischemia and ACS/acute plaque rupture.  TTE yesterday without noted
   WMA.
   -Continue aspirin
   -Continue to trend CEs awaiting trop peak
   .
   # Elevated transaminases:  Continue to rise and suspect d/t shock
   liver.  AP only very mildly elevated and t.bili normal so no e/o
   cholestatic process.  She is also without abdominal pain so as not to
   suggest cholangitis or cholecystitis as underlying cause of infection.
   - continue to monitor LFTs
   .
   # Hypercalcemia: in the setting of diffuse, recurrent MM c/b
   amyloidosis.  Improved s/p IV pamidronate, calcitonin.
   -continue HD
   -continue to monitor levels
   .
   # Increasing oxygen requirement: has chronic oxygen requirement due to
   amyloidosis involvement of the lungs. Also has h/o PEs and is s/p
   pleurodesis. CTA was negative for PE.   Did have some increased
   perihilar opacity on right on CT chest when compared with prior and,
   although not producing much sputum, did produce good specimen which
   shows GPCs.
   -wean oxygen as tolerated to home level 2-3 L
   -continue vanco/zosyn pending senses on GPCs
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Pt initially presented supratherapeutic at prior
   admission, had been subtherapeutic on discharge, Coumadin dose was
   increased upon last discharge. She has an extensive h/o thromobosis of
   unclear etiology.  INR supratherapeutic again on this presentation,
   improved after 1mg PO vitamin K x1.
   - hold coumadin, continue to monitor coags
   .
   # Multiple myeloma: Recurrent; c/b hypercalcemia and amyloidosis
   - heme/onc involved, appreciate their input
   - Continue decadron 20mg daily x5 days (day 1 is [**1-16**])
   - d/w hem/onc possibility of revlimid causing any of the presenting
   issues as above; otherwise plan per hem/onc is to restart revlimid
   .
   # Bone pain:  Given time course, most likely in the setting of
   bisphosphonate during last admission, now s/p additional dose on this
   presentation.  She remains quite uncomfortable.
   - morphine IV prn
   .
   # ESRD on HD: HD today. Pt does not make urine.
   - renal following appreciate their recs
   .
   # h/o PE/DVTs: thought to be due to med effect
   - currently supratherapeutic INR
   .
   # Contrast infiltration: in SC tissues, ~45cc.
   -f/u plastics recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # NSTEMI:  Trop continues to rise (negative CK, -MB).  Suspect in the
   setting of demand from hypotension and probable previously
   unrecognized/asymptomatic tachyarrhythmias.  Think less likely VT is
   d/t ischemia and ACS/acute plaque rupture.  TTE yesterday without noted
   WMA.
   -Continue aspirin
   -Continue to trend CEs awaiting trop peak
   .
   # Elevated transaminases:  Continue to rise and suspect d/t shock
   liver.  AP only very mildly elevated and t.bili normal so no e/o
   cholestatic process.  She is also without abdominal pain so as not to
   suggest cholangitis or cholecystitis as underlying cause of infection.
   - continue to monitor LFTs
   .
   # Hypercalcemia: in the setting of diffuse, recurrent MM c/b
   amyloidosis.  Improved s/p IV pamidronate, calcitonin.
   -continue HD
   -continue to monitor levels
   .
   # Increasing oxygen requirement: has chronic oxygen requirement due to
   amyloidosis involvement of the lungs. Also has h/o PEs and is s/p
   pleurodesis. CTA was negative for PE.   Did have some increased
   perihilar opacity on right on CT chest when compared with prior and,
   although not producing much sputum, did produce good specimen which
   shows GPCs.
   -wean oxygen as tolerated to home level 2-3 L
   -continue vanco/zosyn pending senses on GPCs
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Pt initially presented supratherapeutic at prior
   admission, had been subtherapeutic on discharge, Coumadin dose was
   increased upon last discharge. She has an extensive h/o thromobosis of
   unclear etiology.  INR supratherapeutic again on this presentation,
   improved after 1mg PO vitamin K x1.
   - hold coumadin, continue to monitor coags
   .
   # Multiple myeloma: Recurrent; c/b hypercalcemia and amyloidosis
   - heme/onc involved, appreciate their input
   - Continue decadron 20mg daily x5 days (day 1 is [**1-16**])
   - d/w hem/onc possibility of revlimid causing any of the presenting
   issues as above; otherwise plan per hem/onc is to restart revlimid
   .
   # Bone pain:  Given time course, most likely in the setting of
   bisphosphonate during last admission, now s/p additional dose on this
   presentation.  She remains quite uncomfortable.
   - morphine IV prn

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old woman with multiple myeloma, systemic amyloidosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various issues, including hypercalcemia, supratherapeutic INR, and cardiac amyloidosis.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with documented non-invasive blood pressures as low as 50s in the emergency department and ICU. She has been treated with vasopressors, including phenylephrine and neo, to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 50-55 mmHg.
2. Wide complex tachycardia: The patient has experienced two episodes of wide complex tachycardia, which are suspected to be ventricular tachycardia (VT) due to her known cardiac amyloidosis. She has been treated with amiodarone loading.
3. NSTEMI: The patient's troponin levels continue to rise, suggesting non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). However, the electrocardiogram (ECG) did not show significant changes, and the patient has not experienced chest pain or other symptoms typical of NSTEMI.
4. Elevated transaminases: The patient's liver enzymes continue to rise, suggesting shock liver. The patient has been monitored for signs of liver dysfunction.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium levels have been elevated due to her multiple myeloma and amyloidosis. She has been treated with IV pamidronate and calcitonin.
6. Increasing oxygen requirement: The patient has chronic oxygen requirements due to her amyloidosis involvement of the lungs. She has been weaned off oxygen to home level 2-3 L.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of supratherapeutic INR and has been treated with vitamin K. Her Coumadin dose has been increased, and she will be monitored for coagulation abnormalities.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac amyloidosis and known VT may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation or torsades de pointes.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's cardiac amyloidosis and suspected NSTEMI may lead to cardiac failure, which can worsen her hypotension and other symptoms.
3. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated transaminases may indicate liver dysfunction, which can worsen her overall condition.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic oxygen requirements and increasing oxygen requirement may indicate respiratory failure, which can worsen her overall condition.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and recent hospitalization may increase her risk of infection, including pneumonia, sepsis, or other opportunistic infections.

To mitigate these potential complications, the patient should continue to receive close monitoring and treatment, including:

1. Cardiac monitoring: The patient should be closely monitored for cardiac arrhythmias and other cardiac complications.
2. Vasopressor support: The patient should continue to receive vasopressor support to maintain her blood pressure.
3. Oxygen therapy: The patient should continue to receive oxygen therapy to maintain her oxygen saturation.
4. Liver function monitoring: The patient's liver enzymes should be closely monitored to detect any signs of liver dysfunction.
5. Infection prophylaxis: The patient should receive prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection, and her medical team should be vigilant for signs of infection.
6. Hematology and oncology consultation: The patient's hematology and oncology team should be consulted to discuss her treatment options and monitor her response to therapy."
