 BRAIN ABSCESS (CNS ABSCESS)
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 .H/O BRAIN ABSCESS (CNS ABSCESS)
 .H/O [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evacuation of L parietal abscess, cultures
   positive for Strep. MRI demonstrates interval improvement since
   evacuation. Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.
   Streptococcus species most likely to be involved include viridans
   streptococci, Streptococcus milleri, microaerophilic streptococci and
   Streptococcus pneumoniae. Seems less likely this is [**2-4**] endocarditis
   given negative TEE today. Other possible sources include paranasal
   sinuses, lungs or GI tract. Suspicious of GI tract given fluid
   collection at hilum of spleen seen on CT. Also notable, that patient's
   chief complaint abd pain. Must also consider sinuses though per husband
   pt not complaining of sinus pain nor congestion. Lungs seem unlikely
   given no infiltrates on CXR.
   - Discuss finding of new multiloculated subdural collection on MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 7979**]urg--?further drainage needed
   - Currently on ABX coverage with Vancomycin given PCN allergy.
   - Plan is to initiate PCN desensitization tonight so that PCN 4 million
   units Q4 hrs can be initiated
   - Cont fluconazole until final fungal cx returns
   - follow up final abscess cxs
   - Per Neurosurg plan is for repeat Head CT in 4 weeks
   - F/U ID recs
   .
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. Keppra and Dilantin continued to be titrated up with
   resulting cessation of continous sz activity beginning the evening of
   [**9-2**].
   - Phenytoin level this morning therapeutic
   - Pt bolused another 800mg dilantin yesterday and dilantin dose
   increased to 100/200/200mg, Keppra increased to 2000mg [**Hospital1 **] and
   midazolam gtt increased to 0.25mg/kg/hour
   - Continous EEG monitoring
   - f/u neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Suspicious for focus of infection
   especially given pt's month long complaint of LUQ pain. IR feels this
   is a chronic collection and is not in favor of percutaneous drainage.
   - discuss with general surgery
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now
   - monitor abd exam
   .
   ## PCN Allergy: Plan for PCN desensitization per allergy protocol.
   Risks and benefits discussed with patient's husband who understands
   risks and benefits of desensitization.
   - Desensitization protocol completed without incident.
   - First dose penicillin to be given this morning.
   .
   ## S/P Intubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  She remains stable on CMV. Patient will likely
   require intubation at least until seizures well controlled.
   - ABG 7.45/43/105
   - continue current settings for now
   - CXR in am -
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Per SICU team pt went into afib with rvr and
   was started on dilt drip on [**2143-9-2**]. Pt currently in sinus rhythm in
   90's with ventricular ectopy.
   - cont IV dilt and IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   - consider switching back to outpt dose of sotalol when able to take
   PO's
   .
   ## HTN: BP well controlled at this time. Cont BB and CCB as per above.
   No need for addtl agents at this time.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evacuation of L parietal abscess, cultures
   positive for Strep. MRI demonstrates interval improvement since
   evacuation. Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.
   Streptococcus species most likely to be involved include viridans
   streptococci, Streptococcus milleri, microaerophilic streptococci and
   Streptococcus pneumoniae. Seems less likely this is [**2-4**] endocarditis
   given negative TEE today. Other possible sources include paranasal
   sinuses, lungs or GI tract. Suspicious of GI tract given fluid
   collection at hilum of spleen seen on CT. Also notable, that patient's
   chief complaint abd pain. Must also consider sinuses though per husband
   pt not complaining of sinus pain nor congestion. Lungs seem unlikely
   given no infiltrates on CXR.

   through [**9-2**]. Keppra and Dilantin continued to be titrated up with
   resulting cessation of continous sz activity beginning the evening of

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), bovine Aortic Valve Replacement (AVR), and atrial fibrillation (AFIB). She presented with right-sided weakness and progressing aphasia and was found to have a left-sided parietal abscess, which was drained. The patient has been experiencing fever, seizures, and abdominal pain.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.8°F, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 106/56 mmHg. She is receiving mechanical ventilation and is being monitored for respiratory support.

The patient has a history of PCN allergy and is currently on antibiotics, including vancomycin, fluconazole, and ciprofloxacin. She is also receiving anticonvulsants, including phenytoin, dilantin, and keppra.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and neutrophil count, indicating an active infection. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are normal, but her lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level is elevated.

The patient's medical history includes a brain abscess, which was drained, and a history of atrial fibrillation. She is currently being treated for a suspected infection in the splenic hilum, which is causing abdominal pain.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing antibiotics and anticonvulsants
* Monitoring for seizures and adjusting anticonvulsant dosages as needed
* Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic dosages as needed
* Considering further drainage of the splenic hilum fluid collection
* Continuing to monitor for signs of atrial fibrillation and adjusting treatment as needed
* Monitoring for signs of hypertension and adjusting treatment as needed

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to the suspected infection in the splenic hilum
* Increased intracranial pressure due to the brain abscess
* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or other respiratory complications
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to atrial fibrillation or other cardiac conditions
* Hypertension or hypotension due to various medications or underlying medical conditions
* Infection or sepsis due to the use of antibiotics or other treatments

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment as needed to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 .H/O [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evacuation of L parietal abscess, cultures
   positive for Strep. MRI demonstrates interval improvement since
   evacuation. Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.
   Streptococcus species most likely to be involved include viridans
   streptococci, Streptococcus milleri, microaerophilic streptococci and
   Streptococcus pneumoniae. Seems less likely this is [**2-4**] endocarditis
   given negative TEE today. Other possible sources include paranasal
   sinuses, lungs or GI tract. Suspicious of GI tract given fluid
   collection at hilum of spleen seen on CT. Also notable, that patient's
   chief complaint abd pain. Must also consider sinuses though per husband
   pt not complaining of sinus pain nor congestion. Lungs seem unlikely
   given no infiltrates on CXR.
   - Discuss finding of new multiloculated subdural collection on MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 7979**]urg--?further drainage needed
   - Being transitioned to PCN (off vancomycin) after successful
   desensitization
   - Cont fluconazole until final fungal cx returns
   - follow up final abscess cxs
   - Per Neurosurg plan is for repeat Head CT in 4 weeks; will clarify if
   no further instrumentation for loculated area
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. Keppra and Dilantin continued to be titrated up with
   resulting cessation of continous sz activity beginning the evening of
   [**9-2**].
   - Phenytoin level this morning therapeutic
   - Pt bolused another 800mg dilantin yesterday and dilantin dose
   increased to 100/200/200mg, Keppra increased to 2000mg [**Hospital1 **] and
   midazolam gtt increased to 0.25mg/kg/hour
   - Continous EEG monitoring
   - Appreciate neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Suspicious for focus of infection
   especially given pt's month long complaint of LUQ pain. IR feels this
   is a chronic collection and is not in favor of percutaneous drainage.
   - discuss with general surgery
   -will confirm that OK to have OGT
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID regs
   - monitor abd exam
   .
   ## PCN Allergy: Plan for PCN desensitization per allergy protocol.
   Risks and benefits discussed with patient's husband who understands
   risks and benefits of desensitization.
   - Desensitization protocol completed without incident.
   - To start PCN at therapeutic doses today
   .
   ## S/P Intubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  She remains stable on CMV. Patient will likely
   require intubation at least until seizures well controlled.
   - ABG 7.45/43/105
   - continue current settings for now; will attempt to wean sedatives and
   speak with neurology re: status for possible extubation tomorrow
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Per SICU team pt went into afib with rvr and
   was started on dilt drip on [**2143-9-2**]. Pt currently in sinus rhythm in
   90's with ventricular ectopy.
   - cont IV dilt and IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   - consider switching back to outpt dose of sotalol when able to take
   PO's
   .
   ## HTN: BP well controlled at this time. Cont BB and CCB as per above.
   No need for addtl agents at this time.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), bovine aortic valve replacement (AVR), and atrial fibrillation (AFIB) who presented with right-sided weakness and progressing aphasia. She was found to have a left-sided parietal abscess, which was drained, and cultures positive for Streptococcus. The patient has been experiencing fever, and a brain abscess was suspected. She has also been experiencing seizures, and a focal motor seizure involving the right arm was recorded on EEG. The patient has a history of PCN allergy, and desensitization was performed without incident.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and positive cultures for Streptococcus suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Brain Abscess: The patient's brain abscess has been drained, but there is a risk of recurrence or progression of the abscess.
3. Seizures: The patient's seizures may be a sign of a more severe underlying condition, such as a brain abscess or meningitis.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary to support her respiratory function.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of AFIB and bovine AVR replacement increases her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as atrial flutter or ventricular tachycardia.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of NHL and recent brain abscess may increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
7. Infection: The patient's history of PCN allergy and recent desensitization may increase her risk of infection, particularly with Streptococcus species.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's seizures and brain abscess may increase her risk of neurological complications, such as stroke, meningitis, or encephalitis.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's fever and white blood cell count to assess for signs of sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's brain abscess for signs of recurrence or progression.
3. Continue to manage the patient's seizures with anticonvulsant medications.
4. Continue to support the patient's respiratory function with mechanical ventilation.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust antacid therapy as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy as necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust anticonvulsant therapy as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with a brain abscess and splenic abscess, accompanied by fevers, seizures, and respiratory failure. She is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and sedatives. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.8°F, heart rate of 89 bpm, and blood pressure of 109/69 mmHg. She is mechanically ventilated and has a Foley catheter in place. Her laboratory results show anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's brain and splenic abscesses may progress, leading to further complications such as meningitis, sepsis, or abscess rupture.
2. Seizure activity: The patient's seizure activity may continue, potentially leading to further neurological damage or respiratory compromise.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, requiring further invasive interventions such as tracheostomy or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate underlying cardiovascular instability, which may require further monitoring and treatment.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels may indicate kidney injury, which may require further monitoring and treatment.
7. Sepsis: The patient's fevers and leukocytosis may indicate the development of sepsis, which may require further antibiotic therapy and supportive care.
8. Neurological damage: The patient's brain abscess may lead to permanent neurological damage or death if not treated promptly and effectively.
9. Spleen rupture: The patient's splenic abscess may rupture, leading to hemorrhagic shock and potentially life-threatening complications.
10. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged use of mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of VAP, which may require further antibiotic therapy and supportive care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a brain abscess, splenic abscess, fevers, and respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 101.8°F (38.8°C)
* Heart rate: 89 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 109/69 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Central venous pressure: 23.8 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.6-15.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 7.0-7.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 342-473 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.4-0.5 mg/dL
* Total bilirubin: 0.2-0.4 mg/dL
* Alkaline phosphatase: 0.2-0.5 IU/L
* Lactic acid: 1.5 mmol/L
* LDH: 156 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.8 mg/dL

The patient's medical history is significant for penicillin allergy, wheezing, and rash. She has also had previous reactions to codeine and Keflex.

The patient's current medications include:

* Midazolam (Versed) 23 mg/hour
* Metoprolol 10 mg every 6 hours
* Hydromorphone (Dilaudid) 1-2 mg every 2 hours
* Heparin sodium (Prophylaxis) 5,000 units every 12 hours
* Pantoprazole (Protonix) 40 mg every 12 hours
* Ciprofloxacin 500 mg every 12 hours
* Vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours (discontinued)
* Penicillin G potassium 1 million units every 4 hours
* Metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue PCN desensitization
* Redose Dilantin for seizure control
* Continue Keppra and midazolam for seizure control
* Continue Ciprofloxacin for splenic abscess
* Discuss possible anastomotic leak with surgery and consider gastrograffin study
* Continue current vent management and aim for extubation tomorrow if seizure activity diminishes

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis due to the brain and splenic abscesses
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying condition and mechanical ventilation
* Seizure activity due to the brain abscess
* Anastomotic leak due to the patient's surgical history
* Infection due to the patient's indwelling catheters and tubes
* Bleeding due to the patient's thrombocytopenia

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   progressing aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which
   has been drained course c/b seizures.
   24 Hour Events:
   -Spoke with neurosurg- No further instrumentation; Needs Sutures
   removed on [**2143-9-10**] (POD #10, [**Doctor First Name **] was on [**2143-8-31**]). Needs repeat
   noncontrast CT head in 4 wks and f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1703**].
   -Page [**Numeric Identifier 5083**] when EEG leads removed to take off dressing
   -Radiology said has evidence of chronic sinus disease on MRI, and was
   visualized well, but nothing looks acute and not likely to gain further
   information on dedicated sinus CT.
   -Fluids- goal to be even (concern for DI), started IVF at 150cc/hr for
   2 liters at 2pm; at 2am was even.  FENa 1.39; got urine and serum
   osms...urine osm>500, serum osm 282
   -ID thinks source of fevers=perforated marginal ulcer vs. splenic fluid
   collection; recommended EGD to evaluate for marginal ulcer/abscess
   (which she has had in the past)
   -Spoke with surgery- had recommended gastrograffin study in the past to
   evaluate for leak, but was never done [**2-4**] respiratory status. Also
   asked about OGT, which they said would have to be done very carefully
   if done at bedside. Recommended IR placed Dophoff with concomminant
   gastrograffin study. Will need to speak with IR about this.
   -Got CRP (pending); ESR=150. ID had wanted these studies for baseline.
   Need to touch base about how long to continue antibiotics
   -Neurology said no evidence of seizure activity on EEG. Recommended
   decreasing midazolam to 13.5mg/hour. Want dilantin levels daily, and
   bolus 300-500 to maintain level of 20.

 .H/O BRAIN ABSCESS (CNS ABSCESS)
 .H/O [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evacuation of L parietal abscess, cultures
   positive for Strep. MRI demonstrates interval improvement since
   evacuation. Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.  Less
   likely this is [**2-4**] endocarditis given negative TEE today. Other
   possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI tract.
   Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen seen
   on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain. Must also
   consider sinuses though per husband pt not complaining of sinus pain
   nor congestion. Lungs seem unlikely given no infiltrates on CXR.
   - Discuss finding of new multiloculated subdural collection on MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 7979**]urg--?further drainage needed
   - Now on PCN after successful desensitization
   - Cont fluconazole until final fungal cx returns
   - follow up final abscess cxs
   - Neurosurg recommends no further intervention for now - will need
   sutures out on POD #10 - [**2143-9-10**]
   - MRI showed chronic sinusitis, but nothing acute - further imaging
   unlikely to add more information.
   .
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. Keppra and Dilantin continued to be titrated up with
   resulting cessation of continous sz activity beginning the evening of
   [**9-2**].
   - Continous EEG monitoring - no evidence of seizure activity per
   neurology
   - Phenytoin level this morning low - 12.8.  Neuro wants to maintain
   level at 20.  Will bolus for increased level.
   -Neuro recommendes decreasing midazolam to 13.5mg/hour. Want dilantin
   levels daily, and bolus 300-500 to maintain level of 20.
   - Continue to follow neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Suspicious for focus of infection
   especially given pt's month long complaint of LUQ pain. Discussed with
   ID and general surgery.
   -discuss with IR, plan to place Dophoff with Gastrograffin study to
   evaluate bowel near splenic fluid collection, evaluate for possible
   source of infection, and also allow PO intake if possible.
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID recs
   - monitor abd exam
   .
   ## PCN Allergy: Successful desensitization, now on standing PCN.
   .
   ## S/P Intubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  She remains stable on CMV. Patient will likely
   require intubation at least until seizures well controlled.
   - ABG 7.44/43/99
   - continue current settings for now; weaning sedatives as no new
   seizure activity, will continue to wean as tolerated and as recommended
   by neuro.
   .
   ##Anemia:  HCT low but stable, will continue to follow closely.
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Per SICU team pt went into afib with rvr and
   was started on dilt drip on [**2143-9-2**]. Pt currently in sinus rhythm in
   90's with ventricular ectopy.
   - cont IV dilt and IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   - consider switching back to outpt dose of sotalol when able to take
   PO's
   .
   ## HTN: BP well controlled at this time. Cont BB and CCB as per above.
   No need for addtl agents at this time.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint: This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine
   AVR, afib s/p cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and
   progressing aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which
   has been drained course c/b seizures.
   24 Hour Events:
   -Spoke with neurosurg- No further instrumentation; Needs Sutures
   removed on [**2143-9-10**] (POD #10, [**Doctor First Name **] was on [**2143-8-31**]). Needs repeat
   noncontrast CT head in 4 wks and f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1703**].
   -Page [**Numeric Identifier 5083**] when EEG leads removed to take off dressing
   -Radiology said has evidence of chronic sinus disease on MRI, and was
   visualized well, but nothing looks acute and not likely to gain further
   information on dedicated sinus CT.
   -Fluids- goal to be even (concern for DI), started IVF at 150cc/hr for
   2 liters at 2pm; at 2am was even.  FENa 1.39; got urine and serum
   osms...urine osm>500, serum osm 282
   -ID thinks source of fevers=perforated marginal ulcer vs. splenic fluid
   collection; recommended EGD to evaluate for marginal ulcer/abscess
   (which she has had in the past)
   -Spoke with surgery- had recommended gastrograffin study in the past to
   evaluate for leak, but was never done [**2-4**] respiratory status. Also
   asked about OGT, which they said would have to be done very carefully
   if done at bedside. Recommended IR placed Dophoff with concomminant
   gastrograffin study. Will need to speak with IR about this.
   -Got CRP (pending); ESR=150. ID had wanted these studies for baseline.
   Need to touch base about how long to continue antibiotics
   -Neurology said no evidence of seizure activity on EEG. Recommended
   decreasing midazolam to 13.5mg/hour. Want dilantin levels daily, and
   bolus 300-500 to maintain level of 20.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of NHL, bovine AVR, and afib, which increases the risk of infection. The patient has a brain abscess, which has been drained, and there is a suspicion of a GI tract infection given the fluid collection at the hilum of the spleen.
2. Seizures: The patient has had seizures, which may continue if not properly managed. The patient is on multiple anticonvulsants, including Dilantin and Keppra, and the neurology team is monitoring the patient's seizure activity closely.
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which may exacerbate the patient's condition if not properly managed.
4. Anemia: The patient has a low HCT, which may be related to the patient's underlying medical condition or the patient's bleeding risk.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of afib, which may increase the risk of stroke or embolism if not properly managed.
6. Fluid imbalance: The patient has a fluid imbalance, with a positive fluid balance of 4,091 mL over the past 24 hours, which may increase the risk of complications such as respiratory failure or cardiac failure.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which may increase the risk of respiratory failure if not properly managed.
8. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of neurological complications, including seizures and brain abscess, which may increase the risk of further neurological complications.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should be closely monitored and managed by the ICU team, with regular assessments of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies. The patient should also be treated with antibiotics to prevent infection, and anticonvulsants to manage seizures. The patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored, and the patient should be weaned from mechanical ventilation as tolerated."

   24 Hour Events:
   -Spoke with neurosurg- No further instrumentation; Needs Sutures
   removed on [**2143-9-10**] (POD #10, [**Doctor First Name **] was on [**2143-8-31**]). Needs repeat
   noncontrast CT head in 4 wks and f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1703**].
   -Page [**Numeric Identifier 5083**] when EEG leads removed to take off dressing
   -Radiology said has evidence of chronic sinus disease on MRI, and was
   visualized well, but nothing looks acute and not likely to gain further
   information on dedicated sinus CT.
   -Fluids- goal to be even (concern for DI), started IVF at 150cc/hr for
   2 liters at 2pm; at 2am was even.  FENa 1.39; got urine and serum
   osms...urine osm>500, serum osm 282
   -ID thinks source of fevers=perforated marginal ulcer vs. splenic fluid
   collection; recommended EGD to evaluate for marginal ulcer/abscess
   (which she has had in the past)
   -Spoke with surgery- had recommended gastrograffin study in the past to
   evaluate for leak, but was never done [**2-4**] respiratory status. Also
   asked about OGT, which they said would have to be done very carefully
   if done at bedside. Recommended IR placed Dophoff with concomminant
   gastrograffin study. Will need to speak with IR about this.
   -Got CRP (pending); ESR=150. ID had wanted these studies for baseline.
   Need to touch base about how long to continue antibiotics
   -Neurology said no evidence of seizure activity on EEG. Recommended
   decreasing midazolam to 13.5mg/hour. Want dilantin levels daily, and

 BRAIN ABSCESS (CNS ABSCESS)
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 .H/O BRAIN ABSCESS (CNS ABSCESS)
 .H/O [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evacuation of L parietal abscess, cultures
   positive for Strep. MRI demonstrates interval improvement since
   evacuation. Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.  Less
   likely this is [**2-4**] endocarditis given negative TEE today. Other
   possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI tract.
   Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen seen
   on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain. Must also
   consider sinuses though per husband pt not complaining of sinus pain
   nor congestion. Lungs seem unlikely given no infiltrates on CXR.
   - Discuss finding of new multiloculated subdural collection on MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 7979**]urg--?further drainage needed
   - Now on PCN after successful desensitization
   - Cont fluconazole until final fungal cx returns
   - follow up final abscess cxs
   - Neurosurg recommends no further intervention for now - will need
   sutures out on POD #10 - [**2143-9-10**]
   - MRI showed chronic sinusitis, but nothing acute - further imaging
   unlikely to add more information.
   .
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. Keppra and Dilantin continued to be titrated up with
   resulting cessation of continous sz activity beginning the evening of
   [**9-2**].
   - Continous EEG monitoring - no evidence of seizure activity per
   neurology
   - Phenytoin level this morning low - 12.8.  Neuro wants to maintain
   level at 20.  Will bolus for increased level.
   -Neuro recommendes decreasing midazolam to 13.5mg/hour. Want dilantin
   levels daily, and bolus 300-500 to maintain level of 20.
   - Continue to follow neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Suspicious for focus of infection
   especially given pt's month long complaint of LUQ pain. Discussed with
   ID and general surgery.
   -, plan to place Dophoff with Gastrograffin study to evaluate bowel
   near splenic fluid collection, evaluate for possible source of
   infection, and also allow PO intake if possible. Scheduled for tomorrow
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID recs
   - monitor abd exam
   .
   ## S/P Intubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  She remains stable on CMV. Patient will likely
   require intubation at least until seizures well controlled.
   - ABG 7.44/43/99
   - continue current settings for now; weaning sedatives as no new
   seizure activity, will continue to wean as tolerated and as recommended
   by neuro.
   -talk to neurosurg re weaning sedation, try to wean from vent
   .
   ##Anemia:  HCT low but stable, will continue to follow closely.
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Per SICU team pt went into afib with rvr and
   was started on dilt drip on [**2143-9-2**]. Pt currently in sinus rhythm in
   90's with ventricular ectopy.
   - cont IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   - consider switching back to outpt dose of sotalol when able to take
   PO's
   .
   ## HTN: BP well controlled at this time. Cont BB and CCB as per above.
   No need for addtl agents at this time.
   .
   ##FEN:  goal to keep even.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evacuation of L parietal abscess, cultures
   positive for Strep. MRI demonstrates interval improvement since
   evacuation. Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.  Less
   likely this is [**2-4**] endocarditis given negative TEE today. Other
   possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI tract.
   Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen seen
   on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain. Must also
   consider sinuses though per husband pt not complaining of sinus pain
   nor congestion. Lungs seem unlikely given no infiltrates on CXR.
   - Discuss finding of new multiloculated subdural collection on MR [**First Name (Titles) **]

   - Now on PCN after successful desensitization
   - Cont fluconazole until final fungal cx returns
   - follow up final abscess cxs
   - Neurosurg recommends no further intervention for now - will need
   sutures out on POD #10 - [**2143-9-10**]
   - MRI showed chronic sinusitis, but nothing acute - further imaging
   unlikely to add more information.
   .
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. Keppra and Dilantin continued to be titrated up with
   resulting cessation of continous sz activity beginning the evening of
   [**9-2**].
   - Continous EEG monitoring - no evidence of seizure activity per
   neurology
   - Phenytoin level this morning low - 12.8.  Neuro wants to maintain
   level at 20.  Will bolus for increased level.
   -Neuro recommendes decreasing midazolam to 13.5mg/hour. Want dilantin
   levels daily, and bolus 300-500 to maintain level of 20.
   - Continue to follow neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Suspicious for focus of infection
   especially given pt's month long complaint of LUQ pain. Discussed with
   ID and general surgery.
   -, plan to place Dophoff with Gastrograffin study to evaluate bowel
   near splenic fluid collection, evaluate for possible source of
   infection, and also allow PO intake if possible. Scheduled for tomorrow
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID recs
   - monitor abd exam
   .
   ## S/P Intubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  She remains stable on CMV. Patient will likely
   require intubation at least until seizures well controlled.
   - ABG 7.44/43/99
   - continue current settings for now; weaning sedatives as no new
   seizure activity, will continue to wean as tolerated and as recommended
   by neuro.

   ##Anemia:  HCT low but stable, will continue to follow closely.

   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Per SICU team pt went into afib with rvr and
   was started on dilt drip on [**2143-9-2**]. Pt currently in sinus rhythm in
   90's with ventricular ectopy.
   - cont IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   - consider switching back to outpt dose of sotalol when able to take
   PO's

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, bovine aortic valve replacement, and atrial fibrillation who presented with right-sided weakness and progressing aphasia and was found to have a left-sided parietal abscess which was drained and caused seizures.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* She is still experiencing seizures, which are being treated with anticonvulsants.
* She has a fever, which is being managed with antibiotics.
* She has a brain abscess, which has been drained and is being treated with antibiotics.
* She has a splenic hilum fluid collection, which is suspicious for a focus of infection.
* She has atrial fibrillation, which is being managed with medication.
* She has hypertension, which is being managed with medication.
* She has anemia, which is being monitored.

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

* Seizure activity could increase in frequency or severity.
* Infection could spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs or kidneys.
* The splenic hilum fluid collection could become infected and spread to other parts of the body.
* The brain abscess could recur or become infected again.
* Atrial fibrillation could increase in frequency or severity.
* Hypertension could increase in severity and cause complications such as heart failure or stroke.
* Anemia could worsen and cause complications such as fatigue, shortness of breath, or heart failure.

To prevent these complications, the patient should continue to receive antibiotics for the brain abscess and splenic hilum fluid collection, and anticonvulsants for the seizures. She should also continue to receive medication for atrial fibrillation and hypertension. Her anemia should be monitored closely and treated if necessary."

   24 Hour Events:
   -Spoke with neurosurg- No further instrumentation; Needs Sutures
   removed on [**2143-9-10**] (POD #10, [**Doctor First Name **] was on [**2143-8-31**]). Needs repeat
   noncontrast CT head in 4 wks and f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1703**].
   -Page [**Numeric Identifier 5083**] when EEG leads removed to take off dressing
   -Radiology said has evidence of chronic sinus disease on MRI, and was
   visualized well, but nothing looks acute and not likely to gain further
   information on dedicated sinus CT.
   -Fluids- goal to be even (concern for DI), started IVF at 150cc/hr for
   2 liters at 2pm; at 2am was even.  FENa 1.39; got urine and serum
   osms...urine osm>500, serum osm 282
   -ID thinks source of fevers=perforated marginal ulcer vs. splenic fluid
   collection; recommended EGD to evaluate for marginal ulcer/abscess
   (which she has had in the past)
   -Spoke with surgery- had recommended gastrograffin study in the past to
   evaluate for leak, but was never done [**2-4**] respiratory status. Also
   asked about OGT, which they said would have to be done very carefully
   if done at bedside. Recommended IR placed Dophoff with concomminant
   gastrograffin study. Will need to speak with IR about this.
   -Got CRP (pending); ESR=150. ID had wanted these studies for baseline.
   Need to touch base about how long to continue antibiotics
   -Neurology said no evidence of seizure activity on EEG. Recommended
   decreasing midazolam to 13.5mg/hour. Want dilantin levels daily, and
   bolus 300-500 to maintain level of 20.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best.

Chief Complaint: This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine
   AVR, afib s/p cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and
   progressing aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which
   has been drained course c/b seizures.
   24 Hour Events:
   -Spoke with neurosurg- No further instrumentation; Needs Sutures
   removed on [**2143-9-10**] (POD #10, [**Doctor First Name **] was on [**2143-8-31**]). Needs repeat
   noncontrast CT head in 4 wks and f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1703**].
   -Page [**Numeric Identifier 5083**] when EEG leads removed to take off dressing
   -Radiology said has evidence of chronic sinus disease on MRI, and was
   visualized well, but nothing looks acute and not likely to gain further
   information on dedicated sinus CT.
   -Fluids- goal to be even (concern for DI), started IVF at 150cc/hr for
   2 liters at 2pm; at 2am was even.  FENa 1.39; got urine and serum
   osms...urine osm>500, serum osm 282
   -ID thinks source of fevers=perforated marginal ulcer vs. splenic fluid
   collection; recommended EGD to evaluate for marginal ulcer/abscess
   (which she has had in the past)
   -Spoke with surgery- had recommended gastrograffin study in the past to
   evaluate for leak, but was never done [**2-4**] respiratory status. Also
   asked about OGT, which they said would have to be done very carefully
   if done at bedside. Recommended IR placed Dophoff with concomminant
   gastrograffin study. Will need to speak with IR about this.
   -Got CRP (pending); ESR=150. ID had wanted these studies for baseline.
   Need to touch base about how long to continue antibiotics
   -Neurology said no evidence of seizure activity on EEG. Recommended
   decreasing midazolam to 13.5mg/hour. Want dilantin levels daily, and
   bolus 300-500 to maintain level of 20.

 .H/O BRAIN ABSCESS (CNS ABSCESS)
 .H/O [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evacuation of L parietal abscess, cultures
   positive for Strep. MRI demonstrates interval improvement since
   evacuation. Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.  Less
   likely this is [**2-4**] endocarditis given negative TEE today. Other
   possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI tract.
   Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen seen
   on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain. Must also
   consider sinuses though per husband pt not complaining of sinus pain
   nor congestion. Lungs seem unlikely given no infiltrates on CXR.
   - Discuss finding of new multiloculated subdural collection on MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 7979**]urg--?further drainage needed
   - Now on PCN after successful desensitization
   - Cont fluconazole until final fungal cx returns
   - follow up final abscess cxs
   - Neurosurg recommends no further intervention for now - will need
   sutures out on POD #10 - [**2143-9-10**]
   - MRI showed chronic sinusitis, but nothing acute - further imaging
   unlikely to add more information.
   .
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. Keppra and Dilantin continued to be titrated up with
   resulting cessation of continous sz activity beginning the evening of
   [**9-2**].
   - Continous EEG monitoring - no evidence of seizure activity per
   neurology
   - Phenytoin level this morning low - 12.8.  Neuro wants to maintain
   level at 20.  Will bolus for increased level.
   -Neuro recommendes decreasing midazolam to 13.5mg/hour. Want dilantin
   levels daily, and bolus 300-500 to maintain level of 20.
   - Continue to follow neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Suspicious for focus of infection
   especially given pt's month long complaint of LUQ pain. Discussed with
   ID and general surgery.
   -, plan to place Dophoff with Gastrograffin study to evaluate bowel
   near splenic fluid collection, evaluate for possible source of
   infection, and also allow PO intake if possible. Scheduled for tomorrow
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID recs
   - monitor abd exam
   .
   ## S/P Intubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  She remains stable on CMV. Patient will likely
   require intubation at least until seizures well controlled.
   - ABG 7.44/43/99
   - continue current settings for now; weaning sedatives as no new
   seizure activity, will continue to wean as tolerated and as recommended
   by neuro.
   -talk to neurosurg re weaning sedation, try to wean from vent
   .
   ##Anemia:  HCT low but stable, will continue to follow closely.
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Per SICU team pt went into afib with rvr and
   was started on dilt drip on [**2143-9-2**]. Pt currently in sinus rhythm in
   90's with ventricular ectopy.
   - cont IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   - consider switching back to outpt dose of sotalol when able to take
   PO's
   .
   ## HTN: BP well controlled at this time. Cont BB and CCB as per above.
   No need for addtl agents at this time.
   .
   ##FEN:  goal to keep even.  Will try to place NGT today if study
   allows.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, bovine aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and s/p cardioversion. She was admitted to the ICU with right-sided weakness, progressing aphasia, and a left-sided parietal abscess, which was drained. She developed seizures, which were treated with anticonvulsants.

Current Status:

* Respiratory support: The patient is on continuous mechanical ventilation (CMV) with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.
* Neurological status: The patient is in sinus rhythm, but with ventricular ectopy. She has a low hemoglobin level (7.1 g/dL) and a low platelet count (338 K/uL).
* Fever: The patient has a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F).
* Fluid balance: The patient is receiving intravenous fluids (IVF) at a rate of 150 cc/hr, and her fluid balance is even.
* Medications: The patient is receiving a variety of medications, including anticonvulsants, antibiotics, and sedatives.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Seizure recurrence: The patient's seizures have been controlled with anticonvulsants, but there is a risk of recurrence.
* Infection: The patient has a history of brain abscess and is at risk for further infection.
* Hemorrhage: The patient's low platelet count and hemoglobin level may increase the risk of bleeding.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may require further respiratory support.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's atrial fibrillation and low blood pressure may increase the risk of cardiovascular instability.

Recommendations:

* Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust medications as necessary.
* Continue to provide respiratory support and adjust settings as necessary.
* Monitor the patient's fluid balance and adjust IVF rates as necessary.
* Continue to provide antibiotics and anticonvulsants as prescribed.
* Consider switching the patient to oral medications when possible.
* Monitor the patient's hemoglobin and platelet levels and adjust transfusions as necessary.
* Consider further imaging studies to evaluate the patient's splenic hilum fluid collection and potential sources of infection.
* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust medications as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, brain abscess, and seizures. She has been experiencing significant diuresis over the last day, with a total fluid balance of -1,359 mL. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a FiO2 of 40% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.4°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, and blood pressure of 124/69 mmHg.

The patient has a history of brain abscess, splenic abscess, and fevers, and is currently receiving antibiotics including vancomycin, fluconazole, metronidazole, and ciprofloxacin. She has also been prescribed anticonvulsants, including keppra, midazolam, and dilantin.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she requires ongoing mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration, particularly if her FiO2 is increased or her PEEP is decreased.
2. Brain abscess: The patient's brain abscess is a serious condition that requires ongoing antibiotic therapy. There is a risk of further abscess progression, which could lead to increased intracranial pressure and neurological deterioration.
3. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures, and there is a risk of further seizure activity if her anticonvulsant therapy is not optimized.
4. Splenic abscess: The patient's splenic abscess is a serious condition that requires ongoing antibiotic therapy. There is a risk of further abscess progression, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
5. Anastomotic leak: The patient's anastomotic leak is a potential complication of her surgery, and there is a risk of further leak progression, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
6. DVT: The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to her immobility and underlying medical conditions. There is a need for ongoing prophylaxis to prevent DVT.
7. VAP: The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to her intubation and underlying medical conditions. There is a need for ongoing prophylaxis to prevent VAP.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires ongoing monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

 .H/O [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evacuation of L parietal abscess, cultures
   positive for Strep. Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed
   streptococcus.  Less likely this is [**2-4**] endocarditis given negative TEE
   today. Other possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI
   tract. Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen
   seen on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain.  MRI
   shows chronic sinusitis as a possible source.  Lungs seem unlikely
   given no infiltrates on CXR.
   - will repeat head CT today per neuro recs.
   - continue PCN s/p desentization
   - d/c fluconazole as cultures negative
   - follow up final abscess cxs & sensitivies
   - Neurosurg recommends no further intervention for now - will need
   sutures out on POD #10 - [**2143-9-10**]
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. Keppra and Dilantin continued to be titrated up with
   resulting cessation of continous sz activity beginning the evening of
   [**9-2**].
   - Continous EEG monitoring - no evidence of seizure activity per
   neurology
   - Phenytoin 14.4, will adjust per neuro recs, goal level is 20.
   - per neuro okay to d/c midaz
   - Continue to follow neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Per IR there is most likely a leak
   at her gastric jejunostomy.
   - fup final read of study
   - fup surgery recs
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID recs
   .
   ## S/P Intubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  She remains stable on CMV. Patient will likely
   require intubation at least until seizures well controlled.
   - give need for possible surgery, will not attempt to wean today.
   .
   ##Anemia:  HCT low but stable, will continue to follow closely.
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Per SICU team pt went into afib with rvr and
   was started on dilt drip on [**2143-9-2**]. Pt currently in sinus rhythm in
   90's with ventricular ectopy.
   - cont IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   - consider switching back to outpt dose of sotalol when able to take
   PO's
   .
   ## HTN: BP well controlled at this time. Cont BB and CCB as per above.
   No need for addtl agents at this time.
   ##FEN:  goal to keep even.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, bovine aortic valve replacement, and atrial fibrillation, who presented with right-sided weakness and progressing aphasia. She was found to have a left parietal brain abscess, which was drained, and cultures positive for Streptococcus. She has had seizures, which have been controlled with medication, and remains intubated due to the risk of aspiration and the need for further surgical intervention. She also has a fluid collection at the hilum of her spleen, which is suspected to be related to a gastric jejunostomy leak.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure activity: Despite being controlled with medication, there is a risk of seizure activity persisting, especially if the medication levels are not optimal.
2. Brain abscess: There is a risk of recurrence or spread of the abscess, especially if the patient is not adequately treated with antibiotics.
3. Gastric jejunostomy leak: The leak can lead to peritonitis, sepsis, and other complications if not addressed promptly.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke, thromboembolism, and other cardiac complications.
5. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension increases the risk of cardiac complications, including heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke.
6. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level increases the risk of bleeding, infection, and other complications.
7. Infection: The patient's history of sepsis and the presence of a central line and arterial line increase the risk of infection.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's need for intubation increases the risk of respiratory failure and other respiratory complications.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding increases the risk of bleeding, especially in the presence of a gastric jejunostomy leak.
10. Neurological complications: The patient's history of seizures and brain abscess increases the risk of neurological complications, including stroke, encephalopathy, and other neurological deficits."

 BRAIN ABSCESS (CNS ABSCESS)
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 .H/O BRAIN ABSCESS (CNS ABSCESS)
 .H/O [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evacuation of L parietal abscess, cultures
   positive for Strep. MRI demonstrates interval improvement since
   evacuation. Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.  Less
   likely this is [**2-4**] endocarditis given negative TEE today. Other
   possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI tract.
   Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen seen
   on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain. Must also
   consider sinuses though per husband pt not complaining of sinus pain
   nor congestion. Lungs seem unlikely given no infiltrates on CXR.
   - Discuss finding of new multiloculated subdural collection on MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 7979**]urg--?further drainage needed
   - Now on PCN after successful desensitization
   - Cont fluconazole until final fungal cx return
   - follow up final abscess cxs
   - Neurosurg recommends no further intervention for now - will need
   sutures out on POD #10 - [**2143-9-10**]
   - MRI showed chronic sinusitis, but nothing acute - further imaging
   unlikely to add more information.
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. Keppra and Dilantin continued to be titrated up with
   resulting cessation of continous sz activity beginning the evening of
   [**9-2**].
   - Continous EEG monitoring - no evidence of seizure activity per
   neurology
   - Phenytoin level this morning low - 12.8.  Neuro wants to maintain
   level at 20.  Will bolus for increased level.
   -Neuro recommendes decreasing midazolam to 13.5mg/hour. Want dilantin
   levels daily, and bolus 300-500 to maintain level of 20.
   - Continue to follow neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Suspicious for focus of infection
   especially given pt's month long complaint of LUQ pain. Discussed with
   ID and general surgery.
   -, plan to place Dophoff with Gastrograffin study to evaluate bowel
   near splenic fluid collection, evaluate for possible source of
   infection, and also allow PO intake if possible. Scheduled for tomorrow
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID recs
   - monitor abd exam
   .
   ## S/P Intubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  She remains stable on CMV. Patient will likely
   require intubation at least until seizures well controlled.
   - ABG 7.44/43/99
   - continue current settings for now; weaning sedatives as no new
   seizure activity, will continue to wean as tolerated and as recommended
   by neuro.
   -talk to neurosurg re weaning sedation, try to wean from vent
   .
   ##Anemia:  HCT low but stable, will continue to follow closely.
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Per SICU team pt went into afib with rvr and
   was started on dilt drip on [**2143-9-2**]. Pt currently in sinus rhythm in
   90's with ventricular ectopy.
   - cont IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   - consider switching back to outpt dose of sotalol when able to take
   PO's
   .
   ## HTN: BP well controlled at this time. Cont BB and CCB as per above.
   No need for addtl agents at this time.
   ##FEN:  goal to keep even.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 .H/O [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evacuation of L parietal abscess, cultures
   positive for Strep. MRI demonstrates interval improvement since
   evacuation. Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.  Less
   likely this is [**2-4**] endocarditis given negative TEE today. Other
   possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI tract.
   Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen seen
   on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain. Must also
   consider sinuses though per husband pt not complaining of sinus pain
   nor congestion. Lungs seem unlikely given no infiltrates on CXR.
   - Discuss finding of new multiloculated subdural collection on MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 7979**]urg--?further drainage needed
   - Now on PCN after successful desensitization
   - Cont fluconazole until final fungal cx return
   - follow up final abscess cxs
   - Neurosurg recommends no further intervention for now - will need
   sutures out on POD #10 - [**2143-9-10**]
   - MRI showed chronic sinusitis, but nothing acute - further imaging
   unlikely to add more information.
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. Keppra and Dilantin continued to be titrated up with
   resulting cessation of continous sz activity beginning the evening of
   [**9-2**].
   - Continous EEG monitoring - no evidence of seizure activity per
   neurology
   - Phenytoin level this morning low - 12.8.  Neuro wants to maintain
   level at 20.  Will bolus for increased level.
   -Neuro recommendes decreasing midazolam to 13.5mg/hour. Want dilantin
   levels daily, and bolus 300-500 to maintain level of 20.
   - Continue to follow neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Suspicious for focus of infection
   especially given pt's month long complaint of LUQ pain. Discussed with
   ID and general surgery.
   -, plan to place Dophoff with Gastrograffin study to evaluate bowel
   near splenic fluid collection, evaluate for possible source of
   infection, and also allow PO intake if possible. Scheduled for tomorrow
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID recs
   - monitor abd exam
   .
   ## S/P Intubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  She remains stable on CMV. Patient will likely
   require intubation at least until seizures well controlled.
   - ABG 7.44/43/99
   - continue current settings for now; weaning sedatives as no new
   seizure activity, will continue to wean as tolerated and as recommended
   by neuro.
   -talk to neurosurg re weaning sedation, try to wean from vent
   .
   ##Anemia:  HCT low but stable, will continue to follow closely.
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Per SICU team pt went into afib with rvr and
   was started on dilt drip on [**2143-9-2**]. Pt currently in sinus rhythm in
   90's with ventricular ectopy.
   - cont IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   - consider switching back to outpt dose of sotalol when able to take
   PO's
   .
   ## HTN: BP well controlled at this time. Cont BB and CCB as per above.
   No need for addtl agents at this time.
   ##FEN:  goal to keep even.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), bovine aortic valve replacement (AVR), and atrial fibrillation (AFIB) who presented with right-sided weakness and progressing aphasia. She was found to have a left-sided parietal abscess, which was drained, and has been experiencing seizures.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a FiO2 of 40%. Her respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute, and her SpO2 is 97%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is 109/60 mmHg, and her heart rate is 78 beats per minute. She has a history of AFIB, which has been converted to sinus rhythm.
* Neurological: The patient has been experiencing seizures, which have been controlled with medication. She has a subdural collection on MRI, which is being monitored.
* Infection: The patient has a brain abscess that was drained, and cultures are pending. She also has a fluid collection at the splenic hilum, which is suspicious for a focus of infection.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has been experiencing abdominal pain, and a Dophoff tube with a gastrografin study is planned to evaluate the bowel near the splenic fluid collection.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): The patient's white blood cell count is 11.6 x 10^9/L, and her hemoglobin is 7.3 g/dL.
* Blood chemistry: The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 25.8 mg/dL, and her creatinine is 0.4 mg/dL.
* Liver function tests (LFTs): The patient's alanine transaminase (ALT) is 14 IU/L, and her aspartate transaminase (AST) is 20 IU/L.
* Electrolytes: The patient's sodium is 138 mmol/L, and her potassium is 4.3 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Seizure recurrence
* Development of respiratory failure
* Sepsis or septic shock
* Pneumonia
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Wound infection
* Endocarditis
* Meningitis

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing to monitor her seizure activity and adjusting her medication as needed
* Weaning her off sedation and mechanical ventilation
* Evaluating the fluid collection at the splenic hilum with a Dophoff tube and gastrografin study
* Monitoring her neurological status and adjusting her medication as needed
* Continuing to monitor her blood glucose levels and adjusting her insulin regimen as needed
* Monitoring her electrolyte levels and adjusting her medication as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and the risk of respiratory failure is high due to the presence of an anastomotic leak, which may lead to further complications such as pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome.
2. Anastomotic leak: The patient's gastrointestinal system is at risk of developing an anastomotic leak, which can lead to further complications such as peritonitis, sepsis, and respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's brain abscess and splenic abscess put them at risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death.
4. Cerebral edema: The patient's brain abscess may lead to cerebral edema, which can cause increased intracranial pressure, brain herniation, and death.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding, which can lead to further complications such as hypovolemic shock and organ failure.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen due to ongoing bleeding, which can lead to further complications such as hemorrhagic shock and organ failure.
7. Renal failure: The patient's anemia and coagulopathy may lead to renal failure, which can worsen the patient's overall condition.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's anemia and coagulopathy may lead to cardiovascular instability, which can worsen the patient's overall condition.
9. Neurological complications: The patient's brain abscess may lead to neurological complications such as seizures, which can worsen the patient's overall condition.

In summary, the patient is critically ill and at risk of developing various medical complications. Close monitoring and management of the patient's condition are essential to prevent or treat these complications and improve their outcome."

   CT head shows increased size of subdural collection as well as small

   infectious disease and neurosurgery.  I agree that it makes sense to
   proceed with operative intervention at the present time, since
   antibiotics alone unlikely to be effective in the time span needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   1. Brain abcess: Continue PCN
   2. Seizure: Cont Keppra, midazolam, dilantin.  Midazolam just turned
   off.  No definitive evidence of further seizures
   3. Splenic abcess: no drainable collection per IR. Cont cipro/flagyl
   4. ?Anastomotic leak: Awaiting gastrograffin study results
   5. Respiratory Failure: Continue current vent management. If no
   intervention needed for potential anastomotic leak can move toward
   extubation in next 12-24 hours.
   6. F/E/N: Will continue to try to keep up with Is and Os given
   persistent diuresis.

   Addendum
   CT head shows increased size of subdural collection as well as small
   midline shift.  Abscess size unchanged.  Discussed by our team with
   infectious disease and neurosurgery.  I agree that it makes sense to
   proceed with operative intervention at the present time, since
   antibiotics alone unlikely to be effective in the time span needed.
   Family is at bedside.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 906**], MD
   on:[**2143-9-6**] 19:58 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a brain abscess, splenic abscess, fevers, and respiratory failure. She is currently sedated and intubated, receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical history is significant for penicillin allergy, wheezing, rash, and anaphylaxis. She has received multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, fluconazole, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and penicillin G potassium.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.2°F, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests. Her coagulation studies are within normal limits, and her electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal.

The patient's brain abscess culture has grown Streptococcus milleri. She is currently receiving antibiotics and anticonvulsants for seizure prophylaxis.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 91 and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.25, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 25 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 106 mmHg.

The patient's neurologic examination shows that she is attentive but unable to follow simple commands, with no movement or tone assessed.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Increased intracranial pressure: The patient's brain abscess may continue to grow, leading to increased intracranial pressure and potential herniation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may require more aggressive ventilation or oxygen therapy to maintain adequate oxygenation.
3. Seizure activity: The patient is currently receiving anticonvulsants for seizure prophylaxis, but she may still experience seizures, which could be life-threatening.
4. Infection: The patient's splenic abscess may continue to grow, leading to sepsis and potential organ failure.
5. Anastomotic leak: The patient's recent surgical procedure may have led to an anastomotic leak, which could lead to peritonitis and potential organ failure.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's abnormal coagulation studies may increase her risk of bleeding complications, particularly if she requires surgical intervention.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's slightly abnormal electrolyte levels may lead to cardiac arrhythmias or other complications if not managed properly.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications. Further surgical intervention may be necessary to address the patient's brain abscess and splenic abscess, and her respiratory status requires close monitoring and management."

   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evaculation of subdural abscess and
   drainage of parietal abscess overnight, cultures positive for Strep.
   Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.  Recent negative
   TEE. Other possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI
   tract. Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen
   seen on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain.  MRI
   shows chronic sinusitis as a possible source.  Lungs seem unlikely
   given no infiltrates on CXR
   - continue PCN s/p desentization
   - follow up final abscess cxs & sensitivies
   - needs repeat MRI with gad on [**2143-9-10**]
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. EEG showed interval resolution of seizure activity.
   - Phenytoin 17, will adjust per neuro recs, goal level is 20.
   - Continue to follow neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Per IR there is most likely a leak
   at her gastric jejunostomy.
   - fup final read of study
   -surgery wants NGT to suction- will have IR place today
   -needs CT with IV and PO contrast for further eval for percutaneous
   drainage by IR. Cannot take PO contrast b/c has not yet had s&s eval.
   Will attempt after placement of NGT.
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID recs
   -surgery also recommends GI consult
   .
   ## S/P Intubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  Patient with extubation yesterday, maintaining
   saturations in 93% range on 4L NC overnight.
   -continue to monitor respiratory status

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, bovine aortic valve replacement, and atrial fibrillation who presented with right-sided weakness and progressing aphasia. She was found to have a left-sided parietal abscess, which was drained and cultured positive for Streptococcus. She has also been diagnosed with brain abscess, which was evacuated and drained. The patient has had multiple seizures, and her respiratory status is being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored due to her history of seizures and her need for mechanical ventilation. She is at risk for respiratory failure if her respiratory status deteriorates.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, and her cultures have grown Streptococcus. She is at risk for developing sepsis again if her infection is not properly managed.
3. Neurological Complications: The patient has had multiple seizures and has a history of brain abscess. She is at risk for developing further neurological complications, such as cerebral edema or hemorrhage.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a gastric jejunostomy tube and is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is at risk for developing further cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of infection and is at risk for developing further infections, particularly in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.
7. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.
8. Organ Dysfunction: The patient has a history of organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, and is at risk for developing further organ dysfunction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her ventilator settings as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's infection with antibiotics and monitor her response to treatment.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust her medication regimen as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust her nutrition regimen as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust her medication regimen as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust her medication regimen as needed.
7. Consider placing a central line to facilitate administration of medications and fluids.
8. Consider placing a Foley catheter to monitor the patient's urine output and prevent urinary retention."

 BRAIN ABSCESS (CNS ABSCESS)
 .H/O BRAIN ABSCESS (CNS ABSCESS)
 .H/O [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evaculation of subdural abscess and
   drainage of parietal abscess overnight, cultures positive for Strep.
   Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.  Recent negative
   TEE. Other possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI
   tract. Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen
   seen on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain.  MRI
   shows chronic sinusitis as a possible source.  Lungs seem unlikely
   given no infiltrates on CXR
   - continue PCN s/p desentization, on nafcillin
   - follow up final abscess cxs & sensitivies
   - needs repeat MRI with gad on [**2143-9-10**]
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. EEG showed interval resolution of seizure activity.
   - Phenytoin 17, will adjust per neuro recs, goal level is 20.
   - Continue to follow neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Per IR there is most likely a leak
   at her gastric jejunostomy.
   - fup final read of study
   -needs CT with IV and PO contrast for further eval for percutaneous
   drainage by IR. Has NGT to suction and taking PO contrast through that
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID recs
   -surgery also recommends GI consult- will need to affirm what the
   overall plan is for drainage
   -f/u surgery recs
   .
   ## S/P extubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  Patient with extubation yesterday, maintaining
   saturations in 93% range on 4L NC overnight.
   -continue to monitor respiratory status
   -up to chair today
   -f/u cxr
   .
   ##Anemia:  HCT low but stable, will continue to follow closely.
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Pt has required dilt drip in the past but
   remains in NSR.
   - cont IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   .
   ## HTN: BP well controlled at this time. Cont BB. No need for addtl
   agents at this time.
   ##FEN:  goal to keep even.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She has safely extubated and remains quite alert and able to
   participate in simple tasks. She is moving her right side better too.
   Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] will advise regarding further interventions upon review of her
   abd CT scans. TPN will be initiated until GI issues sorted out. She may
   need IR drainage of intra-abdominal collection even with current
   antibiotics regimen. Her husband has been a good source of support to
   her in the past 24 hours especially after extubation. She is depressed.
   Patient is critically ill

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -Pt transferred back to MICU service
   -NPO now, for speech and swallow eval tomorrow. Until then cannot get
   the PO contrast for requested CT abdomen
   -CT Abd/Pelvis w/ PO and IV contrast recommended for concerning
   peri-splenic fluid collection. Per IR, further imaging is necessary to
   fully evaluate for percuatenous drainage.
   -[**Hospital1 **] protonix started
   -Neurosurg wants MRI w/ gad on [**2143-9-10**]
   -[**Doctor First Name **] recommended GI consult
   -[**Doctor First Name **] wants NGT at suction
   -at 10pm, nursing concerned that pt agitated/?MS changes. throwing mask
   on the ground b/c she was upset with the way it smelt. Husband did not
   voice any particular concern with her behavior. Pt [**Name (NI) 809**]. No evidence of
   somnolence. Saturating well (93% on 4L NC), so we kept her on just NC.

 .H/O BRAIN ABSCESS (CNS ABSCESS)
 .H/O [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evaculation of subdural abscess and
   drainage of parietal abscess overnight, cultures positive for Strep.
   Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.  Recent negative
   TEE. Other possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI
   tract. Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen
   seen on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain.  MRI
   shows chronic sinusitis as a possible source.  Lungs seem unlikely
   given no infiltrates on CXR
   - continue PCN s/p desentization, on nafcillin
   - follow up final abscess cxs & sensitivies
   - needs repeat MRI with gad on [**2143-9-10**]
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. EEG showed interval resolution of seizure activity.
   - Phenytoin 17, will adjust per neuro recs, goal level is 20.
   - Continue to follow neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Per IR there is most likely a leak
   at her gastric jejunostomy.
   - fup final read of study
   -needs CT with IV and PO contrast for further eval for percutaneous
   drainage by IR. Has NGT to suction and taking PO contrast through that
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID recs
   -surgery also recommends GI consult- will need to affirm what the
   overall plan is for drainage
   -f/u surgery recs
   .
   ## S/P extubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  Patient with extubation yesterday, maintaining
   saturations in 93% range on 4L NC overnight.
   -continue to monitor respiratory status
   -up to chair today
   -f/u cxr
   .
   ##Anemia:  HCT low but stable, will continue to follow closely.
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Pt has required dilt drip in the past but
   remains in NSR.
   - cont IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   .
   ## HTN: BP well controlled at this time. Cont BB. No need for addtl
   agents at this time.
   ##FEN:  goal to keep even.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She has safely extubated and remains quite alert and able to
   participate in simple tasks. She is moving her right side better too.
   Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] will advise regarding further interventions upon review of her
   abd CT scans. TPN will be initiated until GI issues sorted out. She may
   need IR drainage of intra-abdominal collection even with current
   antibiotics regimen. Her husband has been a good source of support to
   her in the past 24 hours especially after extubation. She is depressed.
   Patient is critically ill

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current status as follows:

* The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, bovine Aortic Valve Replacement, and Atrial Fibrillation who presented with right-sided weakness and progressing aphasia.
* She has undergone evacuation of subdural abscess and drainage of parietal abscess, with cultures positive for Streptococcus.
* She has a history of seizures, which are currently being managed with phenytoin and keppra.
* She has a splenic hilum fluid collection, which is likely a leak at her gastric jejunostomy, and requires further evaluation for percutaneous drainage.
* She has anemia, with a low but stable hematocrit, and is being monitored closely.
* She has atrial fibrillation, which is currently under control with IV metoprolol.
* She has hypertension, which is well-controlled with medication.
* She has been extubated and is maintaining saturations in the 93% range on 4L nasal cannula oxygen.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Infection: The patient's splenic hilum fluid collection and parietal abscess require further evaluation and treatment to prevent infection.
2. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and history of gastrointestinal bleeding increase her risk of bleeding complications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of seizures and potential respiratory compromise increase her risk of respiratory failure.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypertension increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or stroke.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's splenic hilum fluid collection and gastric jejunostomy increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's history of seizures and potential neurological compromise increase her risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.

To mitigate these potential complications, the patient should continue to receive close monitoring and management of her medical condition, including:

1. Antibiotics for her splenic hilum fluid collection and parietal abscess.
2. Further evaluation and treatment for her gastric jejunostomy leak.
3. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
4. Management of her atrial fibrillation and hypertension with medication.
5. Close monitoring of her gastrointestinal status and potential need for further evaluation or treatment.
6. Close monitoring of her neurological status and potential need for further evaluation or treatment."

   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evaculation of subdural abscess and
   drainage of parietal abscess overnight, cultures positive for Strep.
   Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.  Recent negative
   TEE. Other possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI
   tract. Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen
   seen on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain.  MRI
   shows chronic sinusitis as a possible source.  Lungs seem unlikely
   given no infiltrates on CXR
   - continue PCN s/p desentization, on nafcillin
   - follow up final abscess cxs & sensitivies
   - needs repeat MRI with gad on [**2143-9-10**]
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. EEG showed interval resolution of seizure activity.
   - Phenytoin 17, will adjust per neuro recs, goal level is 20.
   - Continue to follow neurology recs

   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Per IR there is most likely a leak
   at her gastric jejunostomy.
   - fup final read of study
   -needs CT with IV and PO contrast for further eval for percutaneous
   drainage by IR. Cannot take PO contrast b/c has not yet had s&s eval.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, bovine aortic valve replacement, and atrial fibrillation who presented with right-sided weakness and progressing aphasia. She was found to have a left-sided parietal abscess, which was drained, and cultures were positive for Streptococcus. She also has a brain abscess, which was evacuated and drained, and cultures were positive for Streptococcus. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for a variety of conditions, including:

* Brain abscess: The patient is being treated with antibiotics and is scheduled for a repeat MRI with gadolinium on [**2143-9-10**].
* Seizures: The patient has been experiencing focal motor seizures and is being treated with phenytoin and keppra.
* Splenic hilum fluid collection: The patient has a fluid collection at the hilum of her spleen, which is suspected to be a leak from her gastric jejunostomy. She is being treated with antibiotics and is scheduled for a CT scan with IV and PO contrast to further evaluate the collection for percutaneous drainage.
* Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin is low, but stable, and will be monitored closely.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient is being treated with metoprolol and is in normal sinus rhythm.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled, and she is being treated with beta blockers.
* Fever: The patient has a fever, which is being treated with antibiotics.
* Respiratory status: The patient is being monitored closely for respiratory status and is being treated with oxygen therapy.

Potential medical complications:

* Aspiration: The patient's inability to protect her airway increases the risk of aspiration.
* Sepsis: The patient's fever and positive cultures for Streptococcus increase the risk of sepsis.
* Hemorrhage: The patient's low hemoglobin and history of bleeding complications increase the risk of hemorrhage.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and the risk of respiratory failure is increased.
* Neurological complications: The patient's brain abscess and seizures increase the risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or brain damage.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastric jejunostomy and fluid collection at the hilum of her spleen increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation."

 .H/O BRAIN ABSCESS (CNS ABSCESS)
 .H/O [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evaculation of subdural abscess and
   drainage of parietal abscess overnight, cultures positive for Strep.
   Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.  Recent negative
   TEE. Other possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI
   tract. Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen
   seen on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain.  MRI
   shows chronic sinusitis as a possible source.  Lungs seem unlikely
   given no infiltrates on CXR
   - continue PCN s/p desentization, on nafcillin
   - follow up final abscess cxs & sensitivies
   - needs repeat MRI with gad on [**2143-9-10**]
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. EEG showed interval resolution of seizure activity.
   - Phenytoin 17, will adjust per neuro recs, goal level is 20.
   - Continue to follow neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Per IR there is most likely a leak
   at her gastric jejunostomy.
   - fup final read of study
   -needs CT with IV and PO contrast for further eval for percutaneous
   drainage by IR. Has NGT to suction and taking PO contrast through that
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID recs
   -surgery also recommends GI consult- will need to affirm what the
   overall plan is for drainage
   -f/u surgery recs
   .
   ## S/P extubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  Patient with extubation yesterday, maintaining
   saturations in 93% range on 4L NC overnight.
   -continue to monitor respiratory status
   -up to chair today
   -f/u cxr
   .
   ##Anemia:  HCT low but stable, will continue to follow closely.
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Pt has required dilt drip in the past but
   remains in NSR.
   - cont IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   .
   ## HTN: BP well controlled at this time. Cont BB. No need for addtl
   agents at this time.
   ##FEN:  goal to keep even.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evaculation of subdural abscess and
   drainage of parietal abscess overnight, cultures positive for Strep.
   Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.  Recent negative
   TEE. Other possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI
   tract. Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen
   seen on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain.  MRI
   shows chronic sinusitis as a possible source.  Lungs seem unlikely
   given no infiltrates on CXR
   - continue PCN s/p desentization, on nafcillin
   - follow up final abscess cxs & sensitivies
   - needs repeat MRI with gad on [**2143-9-10**]
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. EEG showed interval resolution of seizure activity.
   - Phenytoin 17, will adjust per neuro recs, goal level is 20.
   - Continue to follow neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Per IR there is most likely a leak
   at her gastric jejunostomy.
   - fup final read of study
   -needs CT with IV and PO contrast for further eval for percutaneous
   drainage by IR. Has NGT to suction and taking PO contrast through that
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID recs
   -surgery also recommends GI consult- will need to affirm what the
   overall plan is for drainage
   -f/u surgery recs
   .
   ## S/P extubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  Patient with extubation yesterday, maintaining
   saturations in 93% range on 4L NC overnight.
   -continue to monitor respiratory status
   -up to chair today

   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Pt has required dilt drip in the past but
   remains in NSR.
   - cont IV metop for now

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, bovine aortic valve replacement, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted with right-sided weakness and progressing aphasia and was found to have a left-sided parietal abscess, which was drained. She has also had seizures and is currently being treated with anticonvulsants.

The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for a number of conditions, including:

1. Brain abscess: The patient has a brain abscess that was drained and cultures positive for Streptococcus. She is being treated with antibiotics and is scheduled for a repeat MRI with gadolinium on [**2143-9-10**].
2. Seizures: The patient has had seizures and is being treated with anticonvulsants. She is also being monitored for seizure activity.
3. Splenic hilum fluid collection: The patient has a fluid collection at the hilum of her spleen that is suspicious for a leak at her gastric jejunostomy. She is being treated with antibiotics and is scheduled for a CT scan with IV and PO contrast to further evaluate the fluid collection.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia and is being monitored closely.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation and is being treated with anticoagulation therapy.
6. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension and is being treated with antihypertensive medications.
7. Fever: The patient has a fever and is being treated with antibiotics.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving respiratory support and is being monitored closely.

The patient is at risk for a number of complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying lung disease and her need for respiratory support.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to her underlying infections and her need for antibiotics.
3. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to her anticoagulation therapy and her need for surgical procedures.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her underlying infections and her need for antibiotics.
5. Organ dysfunction: The patient is at risk for organ dysfunction due to her underlying disease and her need for multiple organ support.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of NHL, and the presence of a small air-fluid collection at the splenic hilum, which has decreased in size, may indicate a possible infection. The patient's recent infection or inflammation, possibly due to aspiration, may also contribute to the development of further infections.
2. Abscess: The patient has a history of brain abscess, which has been drained, and there is a possibility of recurrence. The patient's chief complaint of abdominal pain may indicate a possible abscess in the abdominal cavity.
3. Gastrointestinal (GI) leak: The patient has a gastric jejunostomy, and the CT scan shows a possible leak at the site. This may lead to further complications, such as peritonitis or abscess formation.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated and extubated, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates.
5. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of seizures and is at risk of developing further neurological complications, such as stroke or encephalitis.
6. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, which may indicate anemia. This may lead to further complications, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, or decreased cardiac output.
7. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which may lead to further complications, such as stroke or heart failure.
8. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which may lead to further complications, such as heart failure, stroke, or kidney disease.
9. Fluid imbalance: The patient has a fluid imbalance, which may lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, or cardiac arrhythmias.
10. Wound infection: The patient has a history of wound infection, which may lead to further complications, such as sepsis or abscess formation.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan should be implemented:

1. Continue antibiotics for the patient's current infections.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and provide oxygen therapy as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and provide seizure prophylaxis as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels closely.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and provide antihypertensive therapy as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's wound and provide wound care as needed.
7. Consider the patient's history of NHL and potential complications, such as infection or abscess formation.
8. Consider the patient's history of brain abscess and potential complications, such as seizure recurrence or neurological deterioration.
9. Consider the patient's history of gastric jejunostomy and potential complications, such as GI leak or abscess formation.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust the plan as needed based on the patient's response to treatment."

   The small air-fluid collection at the splenic hilum,has slightly
   decreased in size since the previous study and again tracks through the
   spleen
   is an unusual wedge-shaped configuration to the subcapsular region
   associated
   with a small pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis. The
   cause of
   this collection is indeterminate, presence of the wedge-shaped
   low-attenuation
   abnormalities in the periphery of the spleen could represent prior
   infarcts.
   The collection would be difficult to access percutaneously and would
   probably
   require a trans-splenic approach
   New right lower lobe centrilobular nodules with a tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) **]
   configuration
   and atelectasis suggests recent infection or inflammation possibly due
   to
   aspiration.
   Left adnexal ovoid homogeneous cystic abnormality should be further
   assessed
   with ultrasound.
   The case was discussed with the referring physician at the time of
   imaging.

   The endotracheal tube is no longer visualized. There is an NG tube
   with tip in the stomach. There is a right IJ line with tip at the
   cavoatrial
   junction. There is left lower lobe volume loss and right lower lobe
   volume
   loss with obscuration of the hemidiaphragms and underlying infectious
   infiltrate cannot be totally excluded. Compared to the prior study, the
   change in appearance may be secondary to technique and positioning
   rather than
   a true change in the bibasilar atelectasis/infiltrate.

 .H/O [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Per IR there is most likely a leak
   at her gastric jejunostomy.  CT shows some resolution. Currently on
   cipro/Flagyl.
   - not possible to percutaneously drain. Will likely need open surgery.
   Will need to decided if collection can just be clinically followed w/
   antibiotics since it seems to be decreasing in size on CT
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID recs; need to know how
   long of a course should be expected.
   -surgery also recommends GI consult for further visualization of the
   leak; will discuss if they still want consult
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evaculation of subdural abscess and
   drainage of parietal abscess overnight, cultures positive for Strep.
   Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.  Recent negative
   TEE. Other possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI
   tract. Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen
   seen on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain.  MRI
   shows chronic sinusitis as a possible source.  Lungs seem unlikely
   given no infiltrates on CXR
   - continue PCN s/p desentization, on penicillin G
   - follow up final abscess cxs & sensitivies
   - needs repeat MRI with gad on [**2143-9-10**]
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. EEG showed interval resolution of seizure activity.
   - Continue dilantin 100 TID aiming for a corrected dilantin of 15-20 or
   an uncorrected dilantin of [**10-14**]
   - Continue to follow neurology recs
   .
   ## S/P extubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  Patient with extubation yesterday, maintaining
   saturations in 93% range on 4L NC overnight.
   -continue to monitor respiratory status
   -up to chair today
   .
   ##Anemia:  HCT low but stable, will continue to follow closely.
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Pt has required dilt drip in the past but
   remains in NSR.
   - cont IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   .
   ## HTN: BP well controlled at this time. Cont BB. No need for addtl
   agents at this time.
   ##FEN:  goal to keep even.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now.  Will start TPN; awaiting nutrition recs and

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She has a collection of fluid (smaller) near splenic hilum that is not
   amenable to percutaneous drainage. She needs optimization of her
   nutritional status and consideration of a J tube if TPN is not a viable
   option for the next few weeks to allow wound healing around the recent
   surgical site. Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] will advise regarding these issues. She wil
   leave the ICU today as she has been seizure free on current levels of
   dilantin. Her breathing is back to baseline and her RUE weakness has
   also shown signs of improving.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is ill but improving

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   -dilantin should be corrected for albumin c equation of (phenytoin
   level/(0.2xalbumin+0.1). THus yesterday's am dilantin would correct to
   26, so we held pm dilantin and checked again at 9p (which gave level
   corrected to 19). Final decision was to restart 100 TID aiming for a
   corrected dilantin of 15-20 or an uncorrected dilantin of [**10-14**].

   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Per IR there is most likely a leak
   at her gastric jejunostomy.  CT shows some resolution. Currently on
   cipro/Flagyl.
   - not possible to percutaneously drain. Will likely need open surgery.
   Will need to decided if collection can just be clinically followed w/
   antibiotics since it seems to be decreasing in size on CT
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID recs; need to know how
   long of a course should be expected.
   -surgery also recommends GI consult for further visualization of the
   leak; will discuss if they still want consult
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evaculation of subdural abscess and
   drainage of parietal abscess overnight, cultures positive for Strep.
   Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.  Recent negative
   TEE. Other possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI
   tract. Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen
   seen on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain.  MRI
   shows chronic sinusitis as a possible source.  Lungs seem unlikely
   given no infiltrates on CXR
   - continue PCN s/p desentization, on penicillin G
   - follow up final abscess cxs & sensitivies
   - needs repeat MRI with gad on [**2143-9-10**]
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. EEG showed interval resolution of seizure activity.
   - Continue dilantin 100 TID aiming for a corrected dilantin of 15-20 or
   an uncorrected dilantin of [**10-14**]
   - Continue to follow neurology recs
   .
   ## S/P extubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  Patient with extubation yesterday, maintaining
   saturations in 93% range on 4L NC overnight.
   -continue to monitor respiratory status
   -up to chair today
   .
   ##Anemia:  HCT low but stable, will continue to follow closely.
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Pt has required dilt drip in the past but
   remains in NSR.
   - cont IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   .
   ## HTN: BP well controlled at this time. Cont BB. No need for addtl
   agents at this time.
   ##FEN:  goal to keep even.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She has a collection of fluid (smaller) near splenic hilum that is not
   amenable to percutaneous drainage. She needs optimization of her
   nutritional status and consideration of a J tube if TPN is not a viable
   option for the next few weeks to allow wound healing around the recent
   surgical site. Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] will advise regarding these issues. She wil
   leave the ICU today as she has been seizure free on current levels of
   dilantin. Her breathing is back to baseline and her RUE weakness has
   also shown signs of improving.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is ill but improving

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), bovine Aortic Valve Replacement (AVR), and atrial fibrillation (afib) who presented with right-sided weakness and progressing aphasia. She was found to have a left-sided parietal abscess which was drained, and cultures were positive for Strep.

Current issues:

1. Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: A CT scan shows a small air-fluid collection at the splenic hilum, which has decreased in size since the previous study. The collection is not amenable to percutaneous drainage and may require open surgery.
2. Brain Abscess: The patient had a brain abscess which was evacuated and drained, and cultures were positive for Strep. The abscess is suspected to be related to the paranasal sinuses, lungs, or GI tract.
3. Seizures: The patient has been experiencing focal motor seizures involving the right arm, which have been treated with dilantin and keppra.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low but stable.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation has been treated with cardioversion and is currently in sinus rhythm.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled.
7. Fever: The patient has a fever, which is not of unknown origin.

Potential medical complications:

1. Infection: The patient's abscesses and fluid collection at the splenic hilum may be a source of ongoing infection.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and abscesses may lead to sepsis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's lung infiltrates and atelectasis may lead to respiratory failure.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypertension may lead to cardiovascular complications.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's seizures and brain abscess may lead to neurological complications.
6. GI complications: The patient's GI tract may be a source of ongoing infection and inflammation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for the abscesses and fluid collection at the splenic hilum.
2. Monitor the patient's temperature and adjust antibiotics as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider intubation if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust anticonvulsant medications as necessary.
5. Consider placement of a J-tube for nutritional support.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusions as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and adjust medications as necessary.
8. Consider placement of a PICC line for central venous access.
9. Monitor the patient's hypertension and adjust medications as necessary.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's fever and adjust antibiotics as necessary."

 .H/O [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   This is a 53 yo female with history of NHL, bovine AVR, afib s/p
   cardioversion who presented with right sided weakness and progressing
   aphasia and found to have L sided parietal abscess which has been
   drained course c/b seizures.
   .
   ## Brain Abscess: Pt is s/p evaculation of subdural abscess and
   drainage of parietal abscess overnight, cultures positive for Strep.
   Wound cxs from brain abscess confirmed streptococcus.  Recent negative
   TEE. Other possible sources include paranasal sinuses, lungs or GI
   tract. Suspicious of GI tract given fluid collection at hilum of spleen
   seen on CT. Also notable, that patient's chief complaint abd pain.  MRI
   shows chronic sinusitis as a possible source.  Lungs seem unlikely
   given no infiltrates on CXR
   - continue PCN s/p desentization, on nafcillin
   - follow up final abscess cxs & sensitivies
   - needs repeat MRI with gad on [**2143-9-10**]
   ## Seizures: Noted to have focal motor seizures involving right arm
   beginning [**8-31**] recorded on EEG. At that time loaded with dilantin and
   keppra. Despite adding midazolam continous sz activity persisted
   through [**9-2**]. EEG showed interval resolution of seizure activity.
   - Phenytoin 17, will adjust per neuro recs, goal level is 20.
   - Continue to follow neurology recs
   .
   ## Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: Per IR there is most likely a leak
   at her gastric jejunostomy.
   - fup final read of study
   -needs CT with IV and PO contrast for further eval for percutaneous
   drainage by IR. Has NGT to suction and taking PO contrast through that
   - cont flagyl and cipro for now; appreciate ID recs
   -surgery also recommends GI consult- will need to affirm what the
   overall plan is for drainage
   -f/u surgery recs
   .
   ## S/P extubation: Patient intubated prior to going to OR for drainage
   of brain abscess.  Patient with extubation yesterday, maintaining
   saturations in 93% range on 4L NC overnight.
   -continue to monitor respiratory status
   -up to chair today
   -f/u cxr
   .
   ##Anemia:  HCT low but stable, will continue to follow closely.
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation: Pt is s/p cardioversion in [**2141**]. ECGs while in
   house are sinus rhythm. Pt has required dilt drip in the past but
   remains in NSR.
   - cont IV metop for now
   - monitor on tele
   - pt no longer on warfarin given h/o UGIB
   .
   ## HTN: BP well controlled at this time. Cont BB. No need for addtl

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), bovine aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and has undergone cardioversion. She presented with right-sided weakness and progressing aphasia, and was found to have a left-sided parietal abscess, which was drained.

Current medical issues:

1. Brain Abscess: The patient has a history of brain abscess, which has been drained, and cultures have confirmed Streptococcus. The source of the abscess is still unclear, but possibilities include paranasal sinuses, lungs, or gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
2. Seizures: The patient has experienced focal motor seizures involving the right arm, which have been treated with phenytoin and keppra. Despite treatment, seizure activity persisted, and EEG showed interval resolution of seizure activity.
3. Splenic Hilum Fluid Collection: The patient has a fluid collection at the splenic hilum, which is likely due to a leak at her gastric jejunostomy.
4. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, but it is stable.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of AFib, which has been cardioverted. She is currently in sinus rhythm and is being treated with IV metoprolol.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled.
7. Fluid Collection: The patient has a fluid collection at the splenic hilum, which may require further evaluation and drainage.

Potential medical complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of brain abscess and is at risk for further infection.
2. Seizure activity: The patient's seizure activity may persist, and further treatment may be necessary.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's fluid collection at the splenic hilum may lead to further gastrointestinal complications, such as perforation or bleeding.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and respiratory failure may increase her risk of respiratory complications.
5. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's history of bleeding and anemia may increase her risk of hemorrhagic complications.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's brain abscess and seizure activity.
2. Evaluate the patient's splenic hilum fluid collection and consider further drainage or surgical intervention.
3. Continue to treat the patient's atrial fibrillation with IV metoprolol.
4. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusions if necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider further treatment if necessary.
6. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's fluid collection at the splenic hilum."
