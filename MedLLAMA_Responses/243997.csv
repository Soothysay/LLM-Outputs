   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 58 year-old female with a history of metastatic
   breast CA and hypertension who presents with confusion and generalized
   weakness and is found to be in severe acute renal failure. Now HD#2.
   Plan:
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has developed significant renal failure over
   a ten day period with anion gap of 26 and lactate of 4.6. Most likely
   pre-renal, with contribution of NSAID use. Appears intravascularly
   depleted on exam. Fe Urea is 20.8% and FeNa is 0.5% with urine Na of
   14, consistent with pre-renal. No hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound.
   Appreciate renal recs.
   - 2 amps bicarb now
   - replete calcium
   - phos binder
   - will bolus aggressively with fluid overnight, received 1L NS on
   arrival, will now use D5 with sodium bicarb
   - encourage PO fluid intake
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose all medications
   - cont to monitor renal function and if does not improve with IVF
   overnight will continue to work-up for other etiologies
   - cont to trend lactate
   # Weakness/Confusion: Resolving. Most likely secondary to acute renal
   failure. Only localizing component is RLE weakness. Bowel and bladder
   incontinence are concerning for cord lesion though could also be [**1-22**]
   globally depressed mental status. No acute cause identified on head CT.
   Could be delirium secondary to an underlying infectious process (see
   below for infectious work-up).
   - continue serial neuro exams
   - checking calcium
   - will obtain MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] to rule out cord compression
   -  when renal function improves, will check MR brain with contrast to
   look for evidence of new mets (as was planned by pt's oncologist)
   # Leukocytosis: WBC increased after receiving decadron with the taxol
   and is likely steroid induced. Now trending down. In the setting of new
   acute renal failure and lactic acidosis, cannot rule out infection,
   however there is currently no localizing signs or symptoms. She is
   afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Does have a productive cough, but
   this is a very chronic issue for her with no new change on CXR. Growing
   GPCs in blood from [**12-3**]. [**Month (only) 51**] be contaminant, but some concern for
   sepsis given confuion an renal failure.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer and hypertension who presents with confusion, generalized weakness, and severe acute renal failure. She has been started on vancomycin and is receiving aggressive IV fluid resuscitation with sodium bicarbonate. Her lab results show an anion gap of 26 and lactate of 4.6, suggesting pre-renal acute renal failure. She also has leukocytosis, which may be steroid-induced, and is being monitored for signs of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is severe, and if not managed properly, it may lead to further deterioration of her kidney function, potentially requiring dialysis.
2. Sepsis: The patient's growing GPCs in blood and productive cough, along with her acute renal failure and lactic acidosis, raise concerns for sepsis. If not treated promptly, sepsis can lead to organ failure and death.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's mild R basilar rales and decreased breath sounds at the L base may indicate early signs of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of her respiratory status is essential to prevent respiratory complications.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's serum calcium and phosphorus levels are abnormal, which can lead to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and other complications if not corrected.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and growing GPCs in blood suggest the possibility of an underlying infection. Failure to identify and treat the infection promptly may lead to sepsis and organ failure.
6. Metastatic Breast Cancer Progression: The patient's metastatic breast cancer is likely to progress if not managed properly. Delayed treatment may lead to further spread of the disease, reducing her chances of survival.
7. Delirium: The patient's confusion and disorientation may be secondary to her acute renal failure or underlying infection. Failure to manage her delirium may lead to prolonged hospitalization and increased risk of complications.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypertension and acute renal failure may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest. Close monitoring of her cardiovascular status is essential to prevent these complications.

In conclusion, the patient requires close monitoring and aggressive management of her acute renal failure, sepsis, electrolyte imbalance, and other potential complications. Prompt identification and treatment of any underlying infections, as well as management of her metastatic breast cancer, are crucial to improve her chances of survival."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 58 year-old female with a history of metastatic
   breast CA and hypertension who presents with confusion and generalized
   weakness and is found to be in severe acute renal failure. Now HD#2.
   Plan:
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has developed significant renal failure over
   a ten day period with anion gap of 26 and lactate of 4.6.  Taxol and
   Xeloda unlikely to cause renal failure. Most likely pre-renal, with
   contribution of NSAID use. Appears intravascularly depleted on exam. Fe
   Urea is 20.8% and FeNa is 0.5% with urine Na of 14, consistent with
   pre-renal. No hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound. Urine eos negative
   making AID unlikely, but still a possibility given lack of sensitivity
   of the test. Received 1.5 L NS in the ED, and 3L subsequently on the
   floor.
   - Appreciate renal recs.
   - replete calcium
   - phos binder
   - alternate boluses between 1 L NS and 1 L D5W with bicarbonate
   - encourage PO fluid intake
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose all medications
   - cont to monitor renal function and if does not improve with IVF
   overnight will continue to work-up for other etiologies
   - recheck abg, lactate and use bicarb appropriately
   # Leukocytosis/bacteremia: . Growing GPCs in blood from [**12-3**]. [**Month (only) 51**] be
   contaminant, but some concern for sepsis given confusion and renal
   failure.  Does not quite meet sepsis criteria as leukocytosis
   resolving, and only has bacteremia which may be contaminant. WBC
   increased after receiving decadron with the taxol and is likely steroid
   induced. Now trending down. In the setting of new acute renal failure
   and lactic acidosis, cannot rule out infection, however there is
   currently no localizing signs or symptoms. She is afebrile and
   hemodynamically stable. Does have a productive cough, but this is a
   very chronic issue for her with no new change on CXR- resend blood cx.
   Patient may have been bacteremic after port was accessed on 1 d PTA,
   and could have showered bacteria into the blood stream.
   - vancomycin 1 g I v x1 to cover for possible line infection
   - f/u blood and urine cultures; ? coag neg. staph as contaminnat
   - repeat cxs from line now
   - daily surveillance cxs
   - cont to monitor WBC
   - consider port removal if bacteremia documented from port site
   # Weakness/Confusion: Resolving. Most likely secondary to acute renal
   failure. Only localizing component is RLE weakness, which is less
   unilateral on exam today. Bowel and bladder incontinence are concerning
   for cord lesion though could also be [**1-22**] globally depressed mental
   status. No acute cause identified on head CT. Could be delirium
   secondary to an underlying infectious process (see below for infectious
   work-up).
   - continue serial neuro exams
   - checking calcium
   - MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] to rule out cord compression
   -  when renal function improves, will check MR brain with contrast to
   look for evidence of new mets (as was planned by pt's oncologist)
   # Metastatic breast CA: She has just started a new regimen of Taxol 3
   days ago.
   - will touch base with oncology in the AM regarding treatment plan,
   however will likely defer further treatment pending resolution of ARF
   - cont tussionex for cough
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive.
   - Continue metoprolol and holding other outpatient antihypertensives at
   this time for concern of impending septic physiology
   # FEN: aggressive IVF as above, replete lytes prn, regular diet as
   tolerated
   # Access: R port-a-cath
   # PPx: heparin SQ, outpatient H2 blocker
   # Code: full code, confirmed with patient and HCP
   # Dispo: ICU for now
   # Comm: with patient and family

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer and hypertension who presents with dizziness and acute renal failure. She has been diagnosed with severe acute renal failure, anion gap of 26, and lactate of 4.6. The patient is intravascularly depleted, and her urine analysis suggests pre-renal failure. She has also developed leukocytosis and bacteremia, with growing GPCs in her blood. The patient's weakness and confusion are likely secondary to acute renal failure, and she has a productive cough, but no localizing signs or symptoms. She is afebrile and hemodynamically stable.

Potential medical complications:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) with worsening renal function, potentially leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
2. Infection, including sepsis, bacteremia, and line-related infections, which could lead to septic shock and multi-organ failure.
3. Metastatic disease progression, potentially leading to further complications and poor outcomes.
4. Hypocalcemia and electrolyte imbalances, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
5. Respiratory failure, potentially due to pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
6. Neurological complications, including seizures, coma, or death, potentially due to uremic encephalopathy or sepsis.
7. Cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest, potentially due to electrolyte imbalances, sepsis, or other factors.
8. Gastrointestinal complications, including bowel obstruction, perforation, or bleeding, potentially due to tumor progression or sepsis.
9. Skin and soft tissue infections, potentially leading to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
10. Poor wound healing and increased risk of surgical complications due to malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and underlying medical conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 58 year-old female with a history of metastatic
   breast CA and hypertension who presents with confusion and generalized
   weakness and is found to be in severe acute renal failure. Now HD#2.
   Plan:
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has developed significant renal failure over
   a ten day period with anion gap of 26 and lactate of 4.6.  Taxol and
   Xeloda unlikely to cause renal failure. Most likely pre-renal, with
   contribution of NSAID use. Appears intravascularly depleted on exam. Fe
   Urea is 20.8% and FeNa is 0.5% with urine Na of 14, consistent with
   pre-renal. No hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound. Urine eos negative
   making AID unlikely, but still a possibility given lack of sensitivity
   of the test. Received 1.5 L NS in the ED, and 3L subsequently on the
   floor.
   - Appreciate renal recs.
   - replete calcium
   - phos binder
   - alternate boluses between 1 L NS and 1 L D5W with bicarbonate
   - encourage PO fluid intake
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose all medications
   - cont to monitor renal function and if does not improve with IVF
   overnight will continue to work-up for other etiologies
   - recheck abg, lactate and use bicarb appropriately
   # Leukocytosis/bacteremia: . Growing GPCs in blood from [**12-3**]. [**Month (only) 51**] be
   contaminant, but some concern for sepsis given confusion and renal
   failure.  Does not quite meet sepsis criteria as leukocytosis
   resolving, and only has bacteremia which may be contaminant. WBC
   increased after receiving decadron with the taxol and is likely steroid
   induced. Now trending down. In the setting of new acute renal failure
   and lactic acidosis, cannot rule out infection, however there is
   currently no localizing signs or symptoms. She is afebrile and
   hemodynamically stable. Does have a productive cough, but this is a
   very chronic issue for her with no new change on CXR- resend blood cx.
   Patient may have been bacteremic after port was accessed on 1 d PTA,
   and could have showered bacteria into the blood stream.
   - vancomycin 1 g I v x1 to cover for possible line infection
   - f/u blood and urine cultures; ? coag neg. staph as contaminnat
   - repeat cxs from line now
   - daily surveillance cxs
   - cont to monitor WBC
   - consider port removal if bacteremia documented from port site
   # Weakness/Confusion: Resolving. Most likely secondary to acute renal
   failure. Only localizing component is RLE weakness, which is less
   unilateral on exam today. Bowel and bladder incontinence are concerning
   for cord lesion though could also be [**1-22**] globally depressed mental
   status. No acute cause identified on head CT. Could be delirium
   secondary to an underlying infectious process (see below for infectious
   work-up).
   - continue serial neuro exams
   - checking calcium
   - MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] to rule out cord compression
   -  when renal function improves, will check MR brain with contrast to
   look for evidence of new mets (as was planned by pt's oncologist)
   # Metastatic breast CA: She has just started a new regimen of Taxol 3
   days ago.
   - will touch base with oncology in the AM regarding treatment plan,
   however will likely defer further treatment pending resolution of ARF
   - cont tussionex for cough
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive.
   - Continue metoprolol and holding other outpatient antihypertensives at
   this time for concern of impending septic physiology
   # FEN: aggressive IVF as above, replete lytes prn, regular diet as
   tolerated
   # Access: R port-a-cath
   # PPx: heparin SQ, outpatient H2 blocker
   # Code: full code, confirmed with patient and HCP
   # Dispo: ICU for now

   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided. I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4058**]
s note above and
   agree with the findings and plan of care.  We have also discussed the
   patient
s case in depth with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1936**], renal attending.
   The clinical picture may have initially had a component of pre renal
   azotemia, but her BUN and Creat  were too high for that alone and with
   her having had rather mild volume contraction initially and with
   oliguria now persisting after 5+liters of fluid, we think she more
   likely has ATN, perhaps from NSAIDs or per chance even hepatorenal
   syndrome from her liver mets.  In favor of the latter is low urine
   sodium and her ascites and coagulopathy.  She is intravascularly fully
   repleted and we
ll turn down her IV
s and work up portal vein
   thrombosis, hoping for a turnaround in renal function.  Her lactic
   acidosis is of additional concern, raising possibility of systemic
   infection.  Her GPC on bld culture could implicate her portacath.
   Additional bld cultures via line and peripherally will be done as well
   as Vancomycin being continued.  For now she is hemodynamically stable
   with relatively comfortable respiratory status.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has developed significant renal failure over a 10-day period, with an anion gap of 26 and lactate of 4.6. The cause of ARF is likely pre-renal, with a contribution from NSAID use and intravascular depletion.
2. Bacteremia/Leukocytosis: The patient has growing GPCs in her blood, which may be a contaminant or a sign of sepsis. Although the patient does not meet sepsis criteria, the growing GPCs and lactate levels raise concern for infection.
3. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's lactic acid level is 5.8 mmol/L, which is elevated. This may be related to the patient's underlying metabolic state or an underlying infectious process.
4. Confusion/Weakness: The patient's confusion and weakness may be secondary to acute renal failure, but could also be related to an underlying infectious process or cord compression.
5. Metastatic Breast Cancer: The patient has a history of metastatic breast cancer, which may be contributing to her underlying medical condition.
6. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which may be contributing to her underlying medical condition.
7. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has received significant amounts of IV fluids, but still has a fluid imbalance, which may be contributing to her underlying medical condition.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Aggressive IV fluid replacement
2. Repletion of electrolytes as needed
3. Monitoring of renal function and lactate levels
4. Antibiotic therapy for possible bacteremia
5. Further work-up for underlying infectious process
6. Consideration of port removal if bacteremia is documented from the port site
7. Monitoring of the patient's neurological status
8. Consideration of MR brain with contrast to rule out cord compression
9. Deferral of further treatment for metastatic breast cancer pending resolution of ARF
10. Continued monitoring of the patient's overall condition and adjustment of treatment plan as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's 24-hour progress note, the patient's chief complaint is dizziness and acute renal failure. The patient has been started on vancomycin and has received fluid resuscitation with 1 L of normal saline and 1 L of D5W with sodium bicarbonate.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98°F, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 139/67 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

The patient's lab results show acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 6.4 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 28.3 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.8 mEq/L, sodium level of 142 mg/dL, and chloride level of 102 mEq/L.

The patient's complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 9.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 247 K/uL.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) show elevated levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), indicating liver dysfunction. The patient's lactate level is elevated at 5.8 mmol/L, indicating metabolic acidosis.

The patient's acid-base status is abnormal, with a pH of 7.27, bicarbonate level of 14 mEq/L, and base excess of -16 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) progressing to chronic kidney disease (CKD)
2. Metabolic acidosis leading to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness
3. Electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia, hypernatremia, and hypochloremia
4. Liver dysfunction leading to coagulopathy and bleeding
5. Sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)
6. Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation
7. Cardiovascular instability and cardiac arrest

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and clinical status to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 58 year-old female with a history of metastatic
   breast CA and hypertension who presents with confusion and generalized
   weakness and is found to be in severe acute renal failure.
   Plan:
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has developed significant renal failure over
   a ten day period with anion gap of 26 and lactate of 4.6. Most likely
   pre-renal, with contribution of NSAID use. Appears intravascularly
   depleted on exam. Fe Urea is 20.8% and FeNa is 0.5% with urine Na of
   14, consistent with pre-renal. No hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound.
   Appreciate renal recs.
   - 2 amps bicarb now
   - replete calcium
   - phos binder
   - will bolus aggressively with fluid overnight, received 1L NS on
   arrival, will now use D5 with sodium bicarb
   - encourage PO fluid intake
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose all medications
   - cont to monitor renal function and if does not improve with IVF
   overnight will continue to work-up for other etiologies
   - cont to trend lactate
   # Weakness/Confusion: Resolving. Most likely secondary to acute renal
   failure. Only localizing component is RLE weakness. Bowel and bladder
   incontinence are concerning for cord lesion though could also be [**1-22**]
   globally depressed mental status. No acute cause identified on head CT.
   Could be delirium secondary to an underlying infectious process (see
   below for infectious work-up).
   - continue serial neuro exams
   - checking calcium
   - will obtain MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] to rule out cord compression
   -  when renal function improves, will check MR brain with contrast to
   look for evidence of new mets (as was planned by pt's oncologist)
   # Leukocytosis: WBC increased after receiving decadron with the taxol
   and is likely steroid induced. Now trending down. In the setting of new
   acute renal failure and lactic acidosis, cannot rule out infection,
   however there is currently no localizing signs or symptoms. She is
   afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Does have a productive cough, but
   this is a very chronic issue for her with no new change on CXR. Growing
   GPCs in blood from [**12-3**]. [**Month (only) 51**] be contaminant, but some concern for
   sepsis given confuion an renal failure.
   - resend blood cx
   - vancomycin 1 g I v x1
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - cont to monitor WBC
   # Metastatic breast CA: She has just started a new regimen of Taxol 2
   days ago.
   - will touch base with oncology in the AM regarding treatment plan,
   however will likely defer further treatment pending resolution of ARF
   - cont tussionex for cough
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive.
   - will hold anti-hypertensives overnight
   # FEN: aggressive IVF as above, replete lytes prn, regular diet as
   tolerated
   # Access: R port-a-cath
   # PPx: heparin SQ, outpatient H2 blocker
   # Code: full code, confirmed with patient and HCP
   # Dispo: ICU for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer and hypertension who presents with confusion, generalized weakness, and severe acute renal failure. She has been treated with Vancomycin and has a growing GPC in her blood. Her laboratory results show anion gap of 26, lactate of 4.6, and urine Na of 14, consistent with pre-renal acute renal failure. She is also experiencing leukocytosis, likely steroid-induced, and has a productive cough.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Progressive Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is severe, and if not managed promptly, it can lead to further decline in renal function, electrolyte imbalance, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and growing GPC in her blood raise concerns about infection, particularly sepsis. It is essential to monitor her closely for signs of infection and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
3. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's lactate level is elevated, which can be a sign of metabolic acidosis. This condition can worsen if not managed promptly, leading to further complications.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium, sodium, and calcium, are abnormal. It is crucial to monitor and manage these levels closely to prevent further complications.
5. Delirium: The patient's confusion and disorientation may be secondary to her acute renal failure, electrolyte imbalance, or underlying infection. It is essential to monitor her mental status closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
6. Cord Compression: The patient's RLE weakness and bowel and bladder incontinence raise concerns about cord compression. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is recommended to rule out this possibility.
7. Nephrotoxicity: The patient is receiving Vancomycin, which can cause nephrotoxicity. It is essential to monitor her renal function closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
8. Respiratory Complications: The patient's chronic cough and respiratory symptoms may worsen if not managed promptly, leading to respiratory complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure."

   failure. Only localizing component is RLE weakness. Bowel and bladder
   incontinence are concerning for cord lesion though could also be [**1-22**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer and hypertension, admitted to the ICU with confusion and generalized weakness. She has developed severe acute renal failure (ARF) over the past 10 days, with anion gap of 26 and lactate of 4.6. The patient has also been diagnosed with leukocytosis, likely secondary to steroid use. She has a productive cough, but there is no new change on CXR.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is already severely impaired, and further deterioration could lead to chronic kidney disease, electrolyte imbalances, and cardiovascular complications.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and lactic acidosis may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen her condition and lead to sepsis, organ failure, and mortality.
3. Delirium: The patient's confusion and weakness could be caused by delirium, which could be secondary to an underlying infectious process, electrolyte imbalances, or metabolic derangements.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's hypertension and acute renal failure increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and heart failure.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's chronic cough and productive sputum could indicate respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, which could worsen her condition and lead to respiratory failure.
6. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition and decreased appetite could lead to protein-energy malnutrition, which could exacerbate her underlying medical conditions.
7. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's immobility and decreased sensation could increase her risk of developing pressure ulcers, which could lead to infection, sepsis, and mortality.
8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and decreased mobility could increase her risk of developing DVT, which could lead to pulmonary embolism, stroke, and mortality.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   This is a 58 year-old female with a history of metastatic breast CA and
   hypertension who presents with confusion and generalized weakness and
   is found to be in severe acute renal failure.
   Plan:
   # Weakness/Confusion: ? Most likely secondary to acute renal failure.
   However am anisocoria this AM not previously noted; increased
   confusion, vomiting and +babinski on left.  Unlcear if these are acute
   changes.  Acute renal failure as well as hepatic encephalopathy could
   be causes of acute changes.  [**Month (only) 51**] also be steroid related?  (long half
   life).  No acute cause identified on head CT.  Possible Previously
   scheduled for Head MR today as outpatient; with acute renal changes,
   would be reluctant to give contrast.
   - discuss with radiology  MRI this AM
   - continue serial neuro exams

   # Acute renal failure: Presumed to be pre-renal with Fe Urea is 20.8%
   and FeNa is 0.5% on admission; possible ATN from Nsaids. No
   hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound. Renal following; appreciate recs;
   recommend continuing to replete calcium as well as changing diet to
   renal, checking vanc level, cystatin C.  ? If
   - continue phos binder

   # Leukocytosis: stable (WBC 9 this AM) Has + blood culture on
   admission, remainders negative.  Abdominal distention/acites may also
   be possible source.  She is afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Does
   have a productive cough, but this is a very chronic issue for her with

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer and hypertension, admitted to the ICU with complaints of weakness and confusion. She has severe acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 6.8 mg/dL. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, and hyperkalemia. She has a positive blood culture for gram-positive cocci and is receiving vancomycin. Her physical examination reveals anisocoria, mild slurring of speech, and 2+ leg edema. She is currently receiving treatment for acute renal failure, leukocytosis, and metastatic breast cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level of 6.8 mg/dL indicates severe acute renal failure, which can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and increased risk of infection.
2. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood culture and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction, hypotension, and even death.
3. Metastatic Breast Cancer: The patient's history of metastatic breast cancer increases her risk of developing further complications such as liver metastasis, bone metastasis, and respiratory distress.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's hyperkalemia and anemia may lead to electrolyte imbalances, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
5. Infection: The patient's positive blood culture and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of infection, which can lead to further complications such as sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's anisocoria, mild slurring of speech, and 2+ leg edema may indicate neurological complications such as stroke, seizure, or peripheral neuropathy.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's abdominal distention and anemia may indicate gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding, obstruction, or perforation.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypertension and hyperkalemia may increase her risk of developing cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke.

Based on these findings, it is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent further complications."

   This is a 58 year-old female with a history of metastatic breast CA and
   hypertension who presents with confusion and generalized weakness and
   is found to be in severe acute renal failure.
   Plan:
   # Weakness/Confusion: Resolving. Most likely secondary to acute renal
   failure. Only localizing component is RLE weakness. Bowel and bladder
   incontinence are concerning for cord lesion though could also be [**1-22**]
   globally depressed mental status. No acute cause identified on head CT.
   Could be delirium secondary to an underlying infectious process (see
   below for infectious work-up).
   - continue serial neuro exams
   - checking calcium
   - will obtain MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] to rule out cord compression
   -  when renal function improves, will check MR brain with contrast to
   look for evidence of new mets (as was planned by pt's oncologist
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt has developed significant renal failure over
   a ten day period with anion gap of 26 and lactate of 4.6. Most likely
   pre-renal, with contribution of NSAID use. Appears intravascularly
   depleted on exam. Fe Urea is 20.8% and FeNa is 0.5% with urine Na of
   14, consistent with pre-renal. No hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound.
   Appreciate renal recs.
   - 2 amps bicarb now
   - replete calcium
   - phos binder
   - will bolus aggressively with fluid overnight, received 1L NS on
   arrival, will now use D5 with sodium bicarb
   - encourage PO fluid intake
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose all medications
   - cont to monitor renal function and if does not improve with IVF
   overnight will continue to work-up for other etiologies
   .
   # Leukocytosis: WBC increased after receiving decadron with the taxol
   and is likely steroid induced. Now trending down. In the setting of new
   acute renal failure and lactic acidosis, cannot rule out infection,
   however there is currently no localizing signs or symptoms. She is
   afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Does have a productive cough, but
   this is a very chronic issue for her with no new change on CXR.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - cont to monitor WBC
   - monitor fever curve and culture if spikes
   .
   # Metastatic breast CA: She has just started a new regimen of Taxol 2
   days ago.
   - will touch base with oncology in the AM regarding treatment plan,
   however will likely defer further treatment pending resolution of ARF
   - cont tussionex for cough
   .
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive.
   - will hold anti-hypertensives overnight

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer and hypertension who presents with confusion and generalized weakness. She has developed severe acute renal failure, anion gap of 26, and lactate of 4.6. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, and elevated liver enzymes. She has a port-a-cath and is receiving Vancomycin for gram-positive cocci in her blood culture. Her physical examination reveals anisocoria, cachexia, and 2+ LE edema.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely pre-renal in origin, with a possible contribution from NSAID use. She requires aggressive fluid repletion and calcium repletion to prevent further deterioration.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and lactic acidosis may be indicative of an underlying infection. She requires continued monitoring of her WBC and fever curve, and follow-up blood and urine cultures.
3. Delirium: The patient's confusion and disorientation may be secondary to her acute renal failure or an underlying infectious process. She requires serial neuro exams and consideration of a cord lesion or delirium.
4. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are low, which may exacerbate her renal failure. She requires continued monitoring and repletion of calcium as needed.
5. Metastatic Breast Cancer: The patient's cancer is likely to progress, and she requires ongoing treatment and monitoring. Her current regimen of Taxol may need to be adjusted or deferred pending resolution of her acute renal failure.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is currently well-controlled, but she requires ongoing monitoring and treatment to prevent further complications.
7. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's fluid and electrolyte imbalance requires ongoing monitoring and repletion to prevent further complications.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's chronic hypertension and acute renal failure may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or congestive heart failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue aggressive fluid repletion and calcium repletion to prevent further deterioration of the patient's renal function.
2. Monitor the patient's WBC and fever curve closely, and consider follow-up blood and urine cultures if her symptoms worsen.
3. Continue serial neuro exams to monitor the patient's mental status and potential cord lesion or delirium.
4. Replete lytes prn to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.
5. Monitor the patient's calcium levels closely and replete as needed to prevent further hypocalcemia.
6. Touch base with the patient's oncologist to discuss her treatment plan and potential adjustments or deferrals pending resolution of her acute renal failure.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely for signs of cardiac arrhythmias or congestive heart failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer and hypertension, admitted to the ICU with confusion and generalized weakness. She has developed severe acute renal failure, with anion gap of 26 and lactate of 4.6. The patient's blood culture results showed gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 9.9, and lactic acid levels of 4.4 mmol/L. The patient's physical examination reveals anisocoria, distended abdomen, and 2+ LE edema. The patient's medical history includes cancer, hypertension, and acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and there is a risk of further decline if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and lactic acid levels suggest the possibility of infection, which could be a bacterial or fungal infection, considering the patient's immunocompromised state.
3. Delirium: The patient's confusion and disorientation could be secondary to an underlying infectious process, metabolic disturbance, or other medical condition.
4. Cord Compression: The patient's bowel and bladder incontinence could be indicative of cord compression, which needs to be ruled out with further imaging studies.
5. Metabolic Disturbances: The patient's acidosis and electrolyte imbalances need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications.
6. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are within normal limits, but there is a risk of hemodynamic instability if the patient's renal function continues to deteriorate.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory support is currently normal, but there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's underlying medical condition worsens.
8. Skin Breakdown: The patient's distended abdomen and edema could increase the risk of skin breakdown and pressure ulcers.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust fluid management accordingly.
2. Perform serial neuro exams to rule out cord compression and delirium.
3. Obtain further imaging studies, such as an MRI brain with contrast, to rule out cord compression and evaluate for new metastases.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and acid-base status, and adjust management accordingly.
5. Monitor the patient's temperature and culture if it spikes to rule out infection.
6. Consider antibiotic therapy if infection is suspected.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust support as needed.
8. Monitor the patient's skin for signs of breakdown and pressure ulcers."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of acute renal failure, breast cancer, altered mental status, and acidosis. They have undergone various diagnostic tests, including renal ultrasound, head CT, and MRI of the lumbar spine, which have revealed no significant changes. The patient's mental status has deteriorated over the past 24 hours, and their blood cultures have shown gram-positive cocci. They have been treated with vancomycin and are awaiting identification of the bacteria. The patient's electrolyte levels are within acceptable ranges, but they have an anion gap acidosis, which is likely due to renal failure. They have also been experiencing oliguria, and their blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is over 160, suggesting uremic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Uremic encephalopathy: The patient's BUN level is over 160, and their mental status has deteriorated over the past 24 hours. This suggests that they may be experiencing uremic encephalopathy, which is a complication of acute renal failure.
2. Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures have shown gram-positive cocci, which suggests that they may have bacteremia. This could lead to sepsis and organ failure if left untreated.
3. Line infection: The patient has an indwelling port and has been treated with vancomycin. However, there is a concern about the possibility of a line infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
4. Anion gap acidosis: The patient has an anion gap acidosis, which is likely due to renal failure. This could lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and coma if left untreated.
5. Oliguria: The patient's urine output remains minimal, which suggests that they may be experiencing oliguria. This could lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and organ failure if left untreated.
6. Cancer progression: The patient has breast cancer, and their condition may be worsening. This could lead to complications such as metastasis, organ failure, and death.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's lactate level is elevated, which suggests that they may be experiencing metabolic acidosis. This could lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and coma if left untreated.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's lung volumes are lower, which suggests that they may be experiencing respiratory failure. This could lead to complications such as respiratory arrest and death if left untreated."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer and hypertension who presents with confusion, generalized weakness, and severe acute renal failure. The patient's mental status has deteriorated to one-word answers, and she has anisocoria, a glossy visage, and a mildly decreased HCT.

The patient underwent MRI, which showed diffuse metastatic disease, and line placement and HD for acute renal failure. The blood culture from the portocath was positive for Beta Streptococcus Group B, which is pan-sensitive.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 36.3°C, Tcurrent of 36.3°C, HR of 69 bpm, BP of 141/72 mmHg, RR of 16 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 97%. The patient's neurological examination reveals slow speech, mild slurring, and left toe upgoing, with no clonus or strength deficits.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a WBC count of 9.9 K/μL, and acute renal failure, with a BUN of 102 mg/dL and a creatinine of 6.9 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with an ALT of 33 IU/L and an AST of 112 IU/L.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Leukocytosis: improved with Vancomycin, with a plan to continue serial neuro exams and monitor WBC count.
* Renal failure: presumed to be pre-renal, with a plan to continue dialysis, monitor WBC count, and adjust diet as tolerated.
* Metastatic breast cancer: new Taxol regimen initiated last month, with a plan to follow up with oncology.
* Hypertension: currently normotensive, with a plan to hold anti-hypertensives.
* Acidity: metabolic acidosis, with a plan to initiate lactulose for possible hepatic contribution.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pneumonia
* Cardiac arrest due to hypotension or arrhythmias
* Sepsis or septic shock due to blood culture-positive infection
* Hepatic encephalopathy due to liver failure
* Increased intracranial pressure due to cerebral edema or mass effect
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to coagulopathy or gastritis
* Electrolyte imbalance due to dialysis or medication side effects
* Infection due to catheter-related complications or secondary infections.

The patient's treatment plan should focus on addressing these potential complications and managing her underlying conditions, including metastatic breast cancer, acute renal failure, and metabolic acidosis."

 .H/O ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC
   This is a 58 year-old female with a history of metastatic breast CA and
   hypertension who presents with confusion and generalized weakness and
   is found to be in severe acute renal failure.
   Plan:
   # Weakness/Confusion: ? Most likely secondary to acute renal failure.
   However am anisocoria this AM not previously noted; increased
   confusion, vomiting and +babinski on left.  Unlcear if these are acute
   changes.  Acute renal failure as well as hepatic encephalopathy could
   be causes of acute changes.  [**Month (only) 51**] also be steroid related?  (long half
   life).  No acute cause identified on head CT.  Possible Previously
   scheduled for Head MR today as outpatient; with acute renal changes,
   would be reluctant to give contrast.
   - discuss with radiology  MRI this AM
   - continue serial neuro exams
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Presumed to be pre-renal with Fe Urea is 20.8%
   and FeNa is 0.5% on admission; possible ATN from Nsaids. No
   hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound. Renal following; appreciate recs;
   recommend continuing to replete calcium as well as changing diet to
   renal, checking vanc level, cystatin C.  ? If
   - continue phos binder
   - bicarb as needed
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose all medications
   .
   # Leukocytosis: stable (WBC 9 this AM) Has + blood culture on
   admission, remainders negative.  Abdominal distention/acites may also
   be possible source.  She is afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Does
   have a productive cough, but this is a very chronic issue for her with
   no new change on CXR.
   - received ceftriaxone/vanc.- will check vanc level this AM and redose
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - cont to monitor WBC
   - monitor fever curve and culture if spikes
   # Metastatic breast CA: She has just started a new regimen of Taxol 2
   days ago.
   -          f/u with oncology
   .
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive.
   -          will hold anti-hypertensives
   .
   # FEN: Low Ca this AM, replete lytes prn, adjust diet to renal

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   This is a 58 year-old female with a history of metastatic breast CA and
   hypertension who presents with confusion and generalized weakness and
   is found to be in severe acute renal failure.
   Plan:
   # Weakness/Confusion: ? Most likely secondary to acute renal failure.
   However am anisocoria this AM not previously noted; increased
   confusion, vomiting and +babinski on left.  Unlcear if these are acute
   changes.  Acute renal failure as well as hepatic encephalopathy could
   be causes of acute changes.  [**Month (only) 51**] also be steroid related?  (long half
   life).  No acute cause identified on head CT.  Possible Previously
   scheduled for Head MR today as outpatient; with acute renal changes,
   would be reluctant to give contrast.
   - discuss with radiology  MRI this AM
   - continue serial neuro exams
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Presumed to be pre-renal with Fe Urea is 20.8%
   and FeNa is 0.5% on admission; possible ATN from Nsaids. No
   hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound. Renal following; appreciate recs;
   recommend continuing to replete calcium as well as changing diet to
   renal, checking vanc level, cystatin C.  ? If
   - continue phos binder
   - bicarb as needed
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose all medications
   .
   # Leukocytosis: stable (WBC 9 this AM) Has + blood culture on
   admission, remainders negative.  Abdominal distention/acites may also
   be possible source.  She is afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Does
   have a productive cough, but this is a very chronic issue for her with
   no new change on CXR.
   - received ceftriaxone/vanc.- will check vanc level this AM and redose
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - cont to monitor WBC
   - monitor fever curve and culture if spikes
   # Metastatic breast CA: She has just started a new regimen of Taxol 2
   days ago.
   -          f/u with oncology
   .
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive.
   -          will hold anti-hypertensives
   .
   # FEN: Low Ca this AM, replete lytes prn, adjust diet to renal

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer, hypertension, and recent start of Taxol treatment. The patient is currently in the ICU due to severe acute renal failure, which is presumed to be pre-renal in origin. The patient's condition has deteriorated over the past 24 hours, with increased confusion, vomiting, and anisocoria noted for the first time.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 7.0 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 20.8%. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are also abnormal, with elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST).

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 97% and no oxygen therapy required. However, the patient's neurologic status has deteriorated, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12 and a positive Babinski reflex on the left side.

The patient's medical history is significant for metastatic breast cancer, hypertension, and chronic acidosis. The patient's current medications include Taxol, which was started 2 days ago, and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is 7.0 mg/dL, which is indicative of severe acute kidney injury. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased risk of infection.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's LFTs are abnormal, which may indicate liver dysfunction. This can lead to altered mental status, seizures, and increased risk of bleeding.
3. Metastatic breast cancer: The patient's cancer has spread to other parts of the body, which can lead to a variety of symptoms and complications, including pain, fatigue, and weight loss.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently controlled, but the patient's history of hypertension may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.
5. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate infection. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the patient is at risk for developing sepsis.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications. The patient requires close monitoring and management of their acute kidney injury, hepatic encephalopathy, and metastatic breast cancer. The patient's potential medical complications include acute kidney injury, hepatic encephalopathy, metastatic breast cancer, hypertension, and infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, currently in the ICU for acute renal failure, acidosis, and sepsis. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure of 141/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's mental status has deteriorated, with one-word answers on examination and anisocoria noted for the first time. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and metabolic acidosis. The patient's blood culture grew beta streptococcus group B, and she was given vancomycin for GBS. The patient's lactate levels are trending down but still elevated. 

The patient has a dialysis catheter inserted and is receiving hemodialysis. She is also receiving other ICU medications, including ranitidine, pantoprazole, and heparin. 

The patient's physical examination is limited due to altered mental status and anisocoria. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ failure, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and hepatic failure.
2. Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to sepsis and acidosis.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest due to electrolyte imbalances and sepsis.
5. Increased risk of nosocomial infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs).
6. Further deterioration of mental status and potential development of septic encephalopathy.
7. Development of secondary complications, such as rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, and acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   This is a 58 year-old female with a history of metastatic breast CA and
   hypertension who presents with confusion and generalized weakness and
   is found to be in severe acute renal failure.
   Plan:
   # Weakness/Confusion: Improving.  Likely multifactorial given MRI
   findings and Acute renal failure.   EEG ordered yesterday for concern
   for seizure; planned for this AM.  Also concerned for liver
   involvement, but pt improved without getting lactulose.
   - EEG today
   - continue serial neuro exams
   - continue dialysis for uremia.
   - continue steroids; Tx2 of radiation today.
   .
    # Leukocytosis: WBC down to 0.9 this am; pt is d+6 from taxol and this
   is likely a result of treatment. Currently on Vanco for +blood cultures
   (x1); all other blood cultures are negative.
   - continue Vanco dosed by level for now.  Likely 4 week treatment
   needed.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - cont to monitor WBC, watch for neutropenia, follow Onc results re
   Neupogen?
   - monitor fever curve and culture if spikes
   # Acute renal failure: Presumed to be pre-renal.  UPO improving. Renal
   following;
   - f/u  vanc level for GBS,
   - continue phos binder
   - bicarb as needed
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose all medications
   # Metastatic breast CA: New Taxol regimen initiated last month
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive.
   -          will hold anti-hypertensives
   .
   # FEN: gently replete lytes prn,

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer and hypertension, who presents with altered mental status, generalized weakness, and severe acute renal failure. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated bilirubin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient is receiving treatment for cancer, including taxol and radiation therapy, and is being managed for acute renal failure with dialysis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Seizure: The patient's altered mental status and EEG ordered for concern of seizure.
2. Liver failure: The patient's elevated bilirubin levels and abnormal liver function tests suggest potential liver failure.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's severe acute renal failure may lead to acute kidney injury.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated bilirubin levels may indicate infection, which could worsen the patient's condition.
5. Metastatic disease progression: The patient's cancer may be progressing, which could lead to further complications.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium and magnesium, may be imbalanced, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
7. Hemolytic anemia: The patient's elevated bilirubin levels may indicate hemolytic anemia, which could worsen the patient's condition.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's abnormal liver function tests and elevated bilirubin levels may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's condition is complex and multifactorial. The patient is being managed with dialysis for acute renal failure, antibiotics for infection, and steroids for cancer treatment. The patient's laboratory results and vital signs will be closely monitored to assess for any changes in their condition. The patient's electrolyte levels will be closely monitored to prevent electrolyte imbalance. The patient's liver function tests will be repeated to assess for any changes in liver function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-inch tall individual with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with renal failure and is receiving hemodialysis. The patient's MRI head scan revealed limited study due to lack of intravenous contrast, but it did show multiple cerebral and cerebellar masses highly suspicious for worsening metastatic disease.

The patient has received 12-30 cycles of radiation therapy (XRT) and has been treated with vancomycin, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's insulin requirements are 2 units, and their total bilirubin level is greater than 2.1.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure of 138/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's blood work reveals a white blood cell count of 7.6, hemoglobin level of 8.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 192.

The patient's differential diagnosis includes leukocytosis, renal failure, cancer (malignant neoplasm), and acidosis. The patient's plan includes continued treatment with vancomycin, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium, as well as ongoing hemodialysis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Worsening of metastatic disease: The patient's multiple cerebral and cerebellar masses are highly suspicious for worsening metastatic disease, which can lead to further neurological decline and potential seizures or brain edema.
2. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can lead to further electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and potential cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and immunosuppressed state make them susceptible to infection, which can be life-threatening.
4. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction can increase the risk of bleeding, which can be severe and potentially life-threatening.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's insulin requirements are 2 units, which may not be adequate to control their blood glucose levels, potentially leading to hyperglycemia and its associated complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their conditions to prevent potential complications and optimize their outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
 LEUKOCYTOSIS
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), BREAST
 .H/O ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC
   This is a 58 year-old female with a history of metastatic breast CA and
   hypertension who presents with confusion and generalized weakness and
   is found to be in severe acute renal failure.
   Plan:
   # Weakness/Confusion: Improving.  Likely multifactorial given MRI
   findings and Acute renal failure.   EEG ordered yesterday for concern
   for seizure; planned for this AM.  Also concerned for liver
   involvement, but pt improved without getting lactulose.
   - EEG today
   - continue serial neuro exams
   - continue dialysis for uremia.
   - continue steroids; Tx2 of radiation today.
   .
    # Leukocytosis: WBC down to 0.9 this am; pt is d+6 from taxol and this
   is likely a result of treatment. Currently on Vanco for +blood cultures
   (x1); all other blood cultures are negative.
   - continue Vanco dosed by level for now.  Likely 4 week treatment
   needed.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - cont to monitor WBC, watch for neutropenia, follow Onc results re
   Neupogen?
   - monitor fever curve and culture if spikes
   # Acute renal failure: Presumed to be pre-renal.  UPO improving. Renal
   following;
   - f/u  vanc level for GBS,
   - continue phos binder
   - bicarb as needed
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose all medications
   # Metastatic breast CA: New Taxol regimen initiated last month
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive.
   -          will hold anti-hypertensives
   .
   # FEN: gently replete lytes prn,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   This is a 58 year-old female with a history of metastatic breast CA and
   hypertension who presents with confusion and generalized weakness and
   is found to be in severe acute renal failure.
   Plan:
   # Weakness/Confusion: Improving.  Likely multifactorial given MRI
   findings and Acute renal failure.   EEG ordered yesterday for concern
   for seizure; planned for this AM.  Also concerned for liver
   involvement, but pt improved without getting lactulose.
   - EEG today
   - continue serial neuro exams
   - continue dialysis for uremia.
   - continue steroids; Tx2 of radiation today.
   .
    # Leukocytosis: WBC down to 0.9 this am; pt is d+6 from taxol and this
   is likely a result of treatment. Currently on Vanco for +blood cultures
   (x1); all other blood cultures are negative.
   - continue Vanco dosed by level for now.  Likely 4 week treatment
   needed.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - cont to monitor WBC, watch for neutropenia, follow Onc results re
   Neupogen?
   - monitor fever curve and culture if spikes
   # Acute renal failure: Presumed to be pre-renal.  UPO improving. Renal
   following;
   - f/u  vanc level for GBS,
   - continue phos binder
   - bicarb as needed
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose all medications
   # Metastatic breast CA: New Taxol regimen initiated last month
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer and hypertension who presents with confusion and generalized weakness. She is in severe acute renal failure and has multiple cerebral and cerebellar masses highly suspicious for worsening metastatic disease.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Tmax: 37.2°C (99°F)
* Tcurrent: 36.3°C (97.3°F)
* HR: 65 (65-85) bpm
* BP: 138/58 mmHg
* RR: 13 (13-22) inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 97%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Cachectic and jaundiced appearance
* Anisocoria with right pupil 4mm and left pupil 2mm, both sluggishly reactive
* Scleral icterus present
* MM dry, OP clear, EOM intact
* No JVD or cervical lymphadenopathy
* Right portocath in place
* CTA bilaterally
* Distended abdomen with +BS, moderately firm, nontender, palpable liver edge 4cm below RCM
* Dullness at the flanks, no fluid wave
* 2+ LE edema to thighs bilaterally, left > right
* Right fem HD line in place
* Alert, x3, with slow, non-slurred speech, increased complexity of speech
* No clonus, equivocal Babinski, 4/4 strength throughout upper and lower extremities
* No cyanosis, or gross dermatitis, or ecchymoses

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 7.6, 9.2, 4.9, 0.9
* Hct: 28.3, 28.1, 27.7, 24.6, 24.3
* Plt: 192, 172, 102
* Cr: 6.4, 6.8, 6.7, 7.0, 7.0, 5.5, 4.4, 4.9
* TCO2: 8
* Glucose: 177, 128, 137, 129, 187, 133, 139, 149
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 17.5/31.7/1.6, ALT/AST: 31/96, Alk Phos/T Bili: 331/3.0, Lactic Acid: 4.4 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.5 g/dL, LDH: 688 IU/L

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Leukocytosis: WBC down to 0.9 this am, likely due to treatment; continue Vanco dosed by level, f/u blood and urine cultures, monitor WBC, watch for neutropenia, and follow Onc results re Neupogen.
* Acute renal failure: Presumed to be pre-renal, continue phos binder, bicarb as needed, and avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose all medications.
* Metastatic breast CA: New Taxol regimen initiated last month.
* Hypertension: Currently normotensive, will hold anti-hypertensives.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Worsening of metastatic disease with cerebral and cerebellar masses
* Acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease due to pre-renal failure
* Infections, such as sepsis, due to leukocytosis and neutropenia
* Metabolic acidosis due to acute renal failure
* Hypocalcemia due to renal failure
* Hyperkalemia due to renal failure
* Anemia due to chronic disease and renal failure
* Thrombocytopenia due to chronic disease and renal failure
* Hyperglycemia due to diabetes or stress response
* Hypotension due to acute renal failure or sepsis
* Respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pneumonia
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure due to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition is as follows:

The patient has been admitted to the ICU with an altered mental status. The MRI head scan showed limited study due to lack of intravenous contrast, but it did reveal multiple cerebral and cerebellar masses highly suspicious for worsening metastatic disease. The patient has received 12-30 cycles of XRT today and has been treated with vancomycin, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, and blood pressure of 138/58 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 97%. The patient's respiratory support includes a flow rate of 13 inspirations per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.6-9.2 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.0-8.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 192-172 K/uL
* Creatinine: 6.4-7.0 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 149-140 mg/dL
* Total bilirubin: 1.9-2.1 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 4.4 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.5 g/dL
* LDH: 688 IU/L
* Calcium: 6.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 7.3 mg/dL

The patient's diagnosis includes leukocytosis, acute renal failure, cancer (breast), and acidosis. The patient is at risk for further complications, including:

* Worsening of metastatic disease
* Increased risk of bleeding due to platelet count
* Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression
* Increased risk of electrolyte imbalance due to acidosis
* Increased risk of respiratory failure due to lung metastases
* Increased risk of cardiac arrest due to hypotension and electrolyte imbalance

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuous monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results
* Administration of antibiotics and antifungals as necessary
* Management of acidosis and electrolyte imbalance
* Monitoring of respiratory function and oxygen therapy
* Consideration of further diagnostic studies, such as a lumbar puncture or biopsy, to determine the extent of the patient's disease
* Consideration of palliative care and hospice services as necessary."

   Bilirubin rising; other LFT's up but stable.
   Metabolic acidosis with anion gap persists, likely related to renal

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 LEUKOCYTOSIS
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), BREAST
 .H/O ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC
   PANCYTOPENIA
   Mental status improved. Oriented and conversant although lethargic. XRT
   and dialysis will continue. Less likely that hepatic encehalopathy is
   playing a role.
   Pancytopenia likely due to recent chemo. Not yet at threshold for
   transfusion.
   Bilirubin rising; other LFT's up but stable.
   Metabolic acidosis with anion gap persists, likely related to renal
   failure. Urine output beginning to improve.

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Well-nourished, no acute distress
* Eyes: PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), no conjunctival pallor or scleral edema
* Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: Normocephalic, no poor dentition, no endotracheal tube, no NG tube, no OG tube
* Cardiovascular: Normal PMI, no hyperdynamic, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no rub, no murmur
* Peripheral Vascular: Right radial pulse not assessed, left radial pulse not assessed, right DP pulse not assessed, left DP pulse not assessed
* Respiratory: Symmetric expansion, resonant percussion, clear breath sounds, no wheezes or rhonchi
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present, no distension or tenderness
* Extremities: Right 1+ edema, left 1+, no cyanosis or clubbing
* Skin: Warm, no rash or jaundice
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person, place, and time, purposeful movement, no sedation or paralysis

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Leukocytosis
* Renal failure, acute
* Cancer (malignant neoplasm), breast
* H/O acidosis, metabolic
* Pancytopenia
* Mental status improved, oriented and conversant although lethargic
* XRT and dialysis will continue
* Less likely that hepatic encephalopathy is playing a role
* Pancytopenia likely due to recent chemo
* Not yet at threshold for transfusion
* Bilirubin rising, other LFT's up but stable
* Metabolic acidosis with anion gap persists, likely related to renal failure
* Urine output beginning to improve

The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and communication. The patient's disposition is planned for transfer to the floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Worsening of renal failure and acidosis
* Development of sepsis or septic shock
* Increased risk of bleeding due to pancytopenia
* Progression of cancer
* Complications related to brain radiation
* Development of electrolyte imbalances
* Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression
* Development of respiratory failure
* Development of cardiac complications
* Development of gastrointestinal complications"
