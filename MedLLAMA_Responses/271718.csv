   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O ALCOHOL ABUSE
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
 TRAUMA, S/P
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 46 year old male with a history of
   alcohol abuse and end stage liver disease who was admitted to the
   trauma serivce on [**2156-10-23**] after falling down the stairs in his home
   and suffering multiple fractures now transferred to the MICU service
   for management of end stage liver disease and altered mental status.
   Altered Mental Status:  Differential diagnosis includes primary
   neurologic processes related to his intracranial hemorrhage versus
   hepatitic encephalopathy in the setting of trauma.  Other potential
   etiologies to worsen known encephalopathy include infection and GI
   bleeding. Blood and urine cultures are pending.  No stool cultures
   sent.  No ascites on abdominal CT for paracentesis.
   - NGT in place for Lactulose currently getting, titrate to [**2-11**] stools
   per day per liver recs
   - Keep NPO and use NGT for all meds
   - Have started Rifaximin
   - Will get RUQ u/s this am but per OSH notes, has had persistent
   biliary tree duct dilatation, intra and extra hepatic
   - Will obtain MRCP once able to lay still
   - blood and urine cultures pending
   - stool Cdiff pending
   - per neuro surgery will attempt to maintain SBP < 160, INR < 1.5, Plts
   > 80 in the setting of intracranial hemorrhage
   - appreciate neurosurgical consult
   End stage liver disease: Details unclear.  Secondary to alcohol abuse.
   Still drinking.  Unclear baseline hepatic function. Known history of
   ascites and encephalopathy.  Hepatology is following.
   - IV PPI
   - RUQ ultrasound today
   - holding diuretics
   - aggressive lactulose/rifaximin
   - aggressive control of coagulopathy given intraparenchymal hemorrhage
   Concern for GI Bleed: Was guaic positive and Hct trending down.  Recent
   stools are not bright red nor melenic. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage
   appears stable on repeat CT's.
   - Has 18g and 20g x2
   - Keep active T&S --> send new one today
   - Hct's [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse for active bleeding or Hct <21
   - Try to maintain INR <1.5 and Plts >80 although will be difficult in
   liver pt
   Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia:  Patient intubated for airway
   protection.  Now breathing well on nasal cannula with evidence of new
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - wean oxygen as tolerated
   - ceftriaxone/azithromycin for pneumonia, day [**1-17**]
   - consider broadening coverage if pt spikes fevers
   Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage: Now stable on two subsequent CT scans.
   Neurosurgery is following.
   - continue dilantin for seizure prophylaxis
   - dilantin level in the AM
   - Q4H neurochecks
   - repeat head CT in AM
   - will target INR < 1.5, platelets > 80, SBP < 160
   Anemia/? DIC:  Patient with low haptoglobin, small schistocytes,
   elevated d-dimer, concerning for DIC although this is difficult to
   assess in patient's with liver disease. Patient also with grossly
   guaiac positive stools with negative NG lavage.
   - Send for manual smear
   - Q8H hematocrits, platelets, coags
   - will treat with platelets, FFP, PRBCs as necessary, as above
   - goals hct > 21, platelets > 80, INR < 1.5
    Transverse Process Fractures: Per surgery are non-operative.  Does not
   need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - no further management needed
   Shallow Toe Ulcer: No signs of current infection.
   - local wound care
    Peripheral Arterial Disease: Dopplerable pulses.  Healing ulcer on
   right great toe which does not appear infected.
   - local wound care
   - consider vascular consult

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and end-stage liver disease, admitted to the trauma service after falling down the stairs and suffering multiple fractures. He was transferred to the MICU service for management of end-stage liver disease and altered mental status. The patient has been intubated for airway protection and is currently receiving aggressive lactulose and rifaximin therapy for encephalopathy.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which is not ARDS, and is being managed with nasal cannula oxygen and mechanical ventilation.
2. End-Stage Liver Disease: The patient has cirrhosis and portal hypertension, with evidence of intra- and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.
3. Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage: The patient has an intraparenchymal hemorrhage, which is stable on repeat CT scans.
4. Anemia/DIC: The patient has low haptoglobin, small schistocytes, and elevated d-dimer, which may indicate DIC.
5. GI Bleed: The patient has guaiac-positive stools, which may indicate GI bleeding.
6. Pneumonia: The patient has a new infiltrate on CXR, which may indicate pneumonia.
7. Shallow Toe Ulcer: The patient has a shallow toe ulcer, which is not currently infected.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his underlying liver disease and potential GI bleeding.
2. GI Bleed: The patient is at risk for further GI bleeding, which could worsen his encephalopathy and liver function.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory failure, which could worsen his overall condition.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly pneumonia, due to his underlying liver disease and potential GI bleeding.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient is at risk for coagulopathy due to his underlying liver disease, which could worsen his intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

Treatment Plan:

1. Continue aggressive lactulose and rifaximin therapy for encephalopathy.
2. Maintain INR < 1.5 and platelets > 80.
3. Wean oxygen as tolerated.
4. Continue ceftriaxone and azithromycin for pneumonia.
5. Consider broadening coverage if the patient spikes fevers.
6. Continue dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
7. Repeat head CT in the morning.
8. Continue to monitor for signs of sepsis, GI bleed, and respiratory failure.
9. Consider vascular consult for the patient's peripheral arterial disease.
10. Continue to manage the patient's shallow toe ulcer with local wound care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and end-stage liver disease who was admitted to the trauma service after falling down the stairs and suffering multiple fractures. He was transferred to the MICU service for management of end-stage liver disease and altered mental status.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is suspected, but not confirmed.
* He has cirrhosis of the liver, which is causing portal hypertension and biliary tree duct dilatation.
* He has a history of trauma, including multiple fractures and an intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
* He has altered mental status, which is likely due to primary neurologic processes related to his intracranial hemorrhage or hepatitic encephalopathy.
* He has a positive guaiac test and is guaiac positive, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding.

 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
 TRAUMA, S/P
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 46 year old male with a history of
   alcohol abuse and end stage liver disease who was admitted to the
   trauma serivce on [**2156-10-23**] after falling down the stairs in his home
   and suffering multiple fractures now transferred to the MICU service
   for management of end stage liver disease and altered mental status.
   Altered Mental Status: DDx: primary neurologic processes related to his
   intracranial hemorrhage versus hepatitic encephalopathy due to trauma,
   infection, or GI bleed. Blood and urine cultures are pending.  No stool
   cultures sent.  No ascites on abdominal CT for paracentesis.
   - NGT in place for Lactulose currently getting, titrate to [**2-11**] stools
   per day per liver recs
   - Keep NPO and use NGT for all meds
   - Have started Rifaximin
   - Will get RUQ u/s this am but per OSH notes, has had persistent
   biliary tree duct dilatation, intra and extra hepatic
   - Will obtain MRCP once able to lay still
   - blood and urine cultures pending
   - stool Cdiff pending
   - per neuro surgery will attempt to maintain SBP < 160, INR < 1.5, Plts
   > 80 in the setting of intracranial hemorrhage
   - appreciate neurosurgical consult
   End stage liver disease: Outside records without evidence of HepB or C
   infection, some autoimmune serologies negative as well. Thought now to
   be secondary to alcohol abuse.  Still drinking.  Unclear baseline
   hepatic function.
   - F/u with hepatology today
   - IV PPI
   - RUQ ultrasound today
   - holding diuretics
   - aggressive lactulose/rifaximin
   - aggressive control of coagulopathy given intraparenchymal hemorrhage
   Concern for GI Bleed: Was guaic positive and Hct trending down.  Recent
   stools are not bright red nor melenic. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage
   appears stable on repeat CT's.
   - Has 18g and 20g x2
   - Keep active T&S --> send new one today
   - Hct's [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse for active bleeding or Hct <21
   - Try to maintain INR <1.5 and Plts >80 although will be difficult in
   liver pt
   Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia:  Patient intubated for airway
   protection.  Now breathing well on nasal cannula with evidence of new
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - wean oxygen as tolerated
   - ceftriaxone/azithromycin for pneumonia, day [**1-17**]
   - consider broadening coverage if pt spikes fevers
   Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage: Now stable on two subsequent CT scans.
   Neurosurgery is following.
   - continue dilantin for seizure prophylaxis
   - dilantin level in the AM
 needs to be followed up
   - Q4H neurochecks
   - repeat head CT in AM
   - will target INR < 1.5, platelets > 80, SBP < 160
   Anemia/? DIC:  Patient with low haptoglobin, small schistocytes,
   elevated d-dimer, concerning for DIC although this is difficult to
   assess in patient's with liver disease. Patient also with grossly
   guaiac positive stools with negative NG lavage.
   - Send for manual smear
   - Q8H hematocrits, platelets, coags
   - will treat with platelets, FFP, PRBCs as necessary, as above
   - goals hct > 21, platelets > 80, INR < 1.5
    Transverse Process Fractures: Per surgery are non-operative.  Does not
   need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - no further management needed
   Shallow Toe Ulcer: No signs of current infection.
   - local wound care
    Peripheral Arterial Disease: Dopplerable pulses.  Healing ulcer on
   right great toe which does not appear infected.
   - local wound care
   - consider vascular consult

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who was admitted to the trauma service after falling down the stairs and suffering multiple fractures. He is currently in the MICU service for management of ESLD and altered mental status.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection, breathing well on nasal cannula with evidence of new infiltrate on CXR
* Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: stable on two subsequent CT scans, neurosurgery is following
* Altered mental status: DDx: primary neurologic processes related to intracranial hemorrhage versus hepatitic encephalopathy due to trauma, infection, or GI bleed
* End-stage liver disease: outside records without evidence of HepB or C infection, some autoimmune serologies negative as well, thought to be secondary to alcohol abuse
* GI bleed: guaiac positive and Hct trending down, recent stools not bright red nor melenic, intraparenchymal hemorrhage appears stable on repeat CT's
* Anemia/? DIC: patient with low haptoglobin, small schistocytes, elevated d-dimer, concerning for DIC although this is difficult to assess in patient's with liver disease
* Transverse process fractures: per surgery are non-operative, does not need cervical collar or log roll precautions
* Shallow toe ulcer: no signs of current infection, local wound care
* Peripheral arterial disease: Dopplerable pulses, healing ulcer on right great toe which does not appear infected, local wound care
* DM2: on SSI
* FEN: no IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
* Prophylaxis: subcutaneous heparin
* Access: 3 peripherals, arterial line

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: continued respiratory support may be necessary to manage the patient's respiratory failure.
2. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: ongoing monitoring and management of the patient's intraparenchymal hemorrhage is necessary to prevent further bleeding.
3. Altered mental status: the patient's altered mental status may be related to primary neurologic processes or hepatitic encephalopathy, and ongoing monitoring and management is necessary to determine the underlying cause.
4. GI bleed: the patient's GI bleed may be related to ESLD, and ongoing monitoring and management is necessary to prevent further bleeding.
5. Anemia/? DIC: the patient's anemia and low platelet count may be related to ESLD, and ongoing monitoring and management is necessary to prevent further bleeding.
6. Transverse process fractures: the patient's non-operative fractures may require ongoing monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
7. Shallow toe ulcer: the patient's shallow toe ulcer may require ongoing local wound care and monitoring to prevent infection.
8. Peripheral arterial disease: the patient's peripheral arterial disease may require ongoing monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
9. DM2: the patient's DM2 may require ongoing management and monitoring to prevent further complications.
10. FEN: the patient's FEN may require ongoing management and monitoring to prevent further complications.

The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - will target INR < 1.5, platelets > 80, SBP < 160
   Anemia/? DIC:  Patient with low haptoglobin, small schistocytes,
   elevated d-dimer, concerning for DIC although this is difficult to
   assess in patient's with liver disease. Patient also with grossly
   guaiac positive stools with negative NG lavage.
   - Heme consult
   - Look through OSH records and establish baseline Hct
   - Send for manual smear
   - Q8H hematocrits, platelets, coags
   - will treat with platelets, FFP, PRBCs as necessary, as above
   - goals hct > 21, platelets > 80, INR < 1.5
    Transverse Process Fractures: Per surgery are non-operative.  Does not
   need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - no further management needed
   Shallow Toe Ulcer: No signs of current infection.
   - local wound care
    Peripheral Arterial Disease: Dopplerable pulses.  Healing ulcer on
   right great toe which does not appear infected.
   - local wound care
   - consider vascular consult
   DM2: On SSI
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   Prophylaxis: Not on subQ heparin given above issues
   Access: 2 peripherals, arterial line

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and end-stage liver disease who was admitted to the trauma service after falling down the stairs and suffering multiple fractures. He is currently in the MICU service for management of end-stage liver disease and altered mental status.

The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple potential complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection and is receiving mechanical ventilation. He has evidence of new infiltrate on CXR, which may indicate pneumonia.
2. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: The patient has a stable intraparenchymal hemorrhage, but the neurosurgery team is following him closely.
3. End-stage liver disease: The patient has cirrhosis and portal hypertension, and is at risk for further liver damage and failure.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a low platelet count and an elevated international normalized ratio (INR), which may indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
5. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, which may be due to chronic blood loss or bone marrow failure.
6. GI bleed: The patient has guaiac-positive stools, which may indicate a GI bleed.
7. Pneumonia: The patient has a new infiltrate on CXR, which may indicate pneumonia.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including lactulose, rifaximin, and antibiotics, and is being closely monitored for signs of further deterioration. The patient's family has been notified of his condition and has been instructed to contact the hospital if they have any concerns.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Further liver damage and failure
2. Increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy
3. Development of DIC
4. Worsening of respiratory failure
5. Progression of pneumonia
6. GI bleed or perforation
7. Development of sepsis

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan as necessary to prevent these potential complications and improve his outcomes."
