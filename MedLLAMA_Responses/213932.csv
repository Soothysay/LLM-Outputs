 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old lady with hypotension and radiographic evidence of
   pneumonia now two days out from rehab after a CABG. She is comfortable
   at this time.
   1. Hypotension: Has not required pressors.  Etiology is likely
   hypovolemia vs sepsis from pneumonia.  Hypovolemia seems most likely at
   this time.  I am reassured that she does not have a PE based on
   indeterminate V/Q scan, negative echo and negative LENI
s, so we can
   stop the heparin.  While ideally we would to a CTA chest, her impaired
   renal function makes that risky.  She appears euvolemic now and
   presumably remains below her baseline blood pressure (on metoprolol and
   lisinopril at home), which may still be due to infection.  However her
   urine output and creatinine have improved, which is reassuring.  We
   will monitor closely through the day.
   - stop heprin
   - continue antibiotics for pneumonia as below
   - Try to correlate non-invasive BPs with arterial line.  If she can be
   monitored with cuff she can have the a-line out and go to the floor.
   - Hold metoprolol and lisinopril.
   2. (HC vs. Hospital Acquired) Pneumonia: The patient has radiographic
   evidence of a RLL PNA, HAP versus HCAP given history with associated
   left sided pleuritic pain.  She denies cough or fever.  We can treat
   with a seven-day course of antibiotics.  We will try to an induced
   sputum to obtain cultures to narrow coverage.
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for 7 day course.  Hopefully we can narrow based
   on sputum culture.  She has been MRSA positive in the past, so she will
   likely need vanco for all 7 days unless we can grow an organism.
   3. Delirium with tremulousness: The patient has developed waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status in the past 24 hours per family report.  She has
   also developed new tremor at this time.  Toxicology attending agrees
   that picture could be due to neurontin toxicity, and her improved exam
   today would support that.
   - Talk to family today about whether she is approaching her baseline.
   - PT consult to assess risk for falls
   - Hold compazine and neurontin
   4. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Creatinine improved this morning to
   1.7 from 2.8 on admission.  FENa calculated at 0.2%, supporting simple
   prerenal etiology and not ATN.  We will continue to trend towards
   baseline, with further work-up held unless she does not improve.
   - Euvolemic now, should be able to self-regulate with PO intake.
   - Trend Cr
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Hold Lisinopril and Lasix.  [**Month (only) 51**] require reduced lasix dose on
   discharge.
   5. Anemia: Patient is stably anemic with fluid resuscitation, making
   hemoconcentration unlikely. Guaiac negative, no signs of bleeding or
   hemolysis given normal LFTs. Retic count is depressed.  B12 and folate
   normal.  Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.  No further
   work-up at this time.
   - daily Hct while in hospital with transfusion for Hct<21.
   6. s/p CABG: Complicated by postop atrial fibrillation, currently in
   Sinus. QTc 438.  Elevated Troponin difficult to interpret given renal
   failure; CK elevated from hemolysis
   - Repeat Troponin
   - Hold Amiodarone given hypotension
   - Appreciate CSurg wound care recs
   - Continue ASA, Statin
   8. Arthritis: Patient with chronic pain
   - Tylenol PRN add Tramadol PRN if pain not well controlled
   9. GERD: Continue Omeprazole
   10. Glaucoma: Continue Latanoprost
   FEN: No further IVF, replete lytes PRN, regular diet
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin
   Access: peripherals and a-line.  A-line can be pulled if cuff pressures
   correlate.
   Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   Communication: Patient & Daughter [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1936**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 11582**])
   Disposition: To floor today early if cuff pressures correlate, later in
   day if pressures are stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of mental status changes, tremor, and renal failure. She has a history of CABG and has been in rehab for two days prior to admission. Her current condition is complicated by acute pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, and acute renal failure. She is hypotensive and has been treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. Her mental status has improved slightly, but she still has a tremor. Her laboratory results show acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL and a urine output of 210 mL over the past 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is not fully treated, and she may develop respiratory failure or sepsis.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's pulmonary embolism may worsen, causing respiratory failure or death.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen, causing organ dysfunction or failure.
5. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen, causing agitation, aggression, or even death.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, causing fatigue, shortness of breath, or decreased cognitive function.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac condition may worsen, causing heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
8. Infection: The patient may develop a secondary infection, such as sepsis or urinary tract infection, which could worsen her condition.
9. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient may develop gastrointestinal bleeding, obstruction, or perforation due to her chronic conditions or medications.
10. Neurological Complications: The patient may develop neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or encephalopathy, due to her underlying conditions or medications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for pneumonia and monitor for signs of improvement or worsening.
2. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider dialysis if necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's pulmonary embolism closely and consider anticoagulation therapy if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's hypotension closely and consider vasopressor therapy if necessary.

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old lady with hypotension and radiographic evidence of
   pneumonia now two days out from rehab after a CABG. She is comfortable
   at this time.
   1. Hypotension: Has not required pressors.  Most likely source seems to
   be hypovolemia.
   - stop heprin
   - continue antibiotics
   Possible etiologies of hypotension include poor PO intake and
   hypovolemia (as supported by history) or sepsis from a Pneumonia as
   supported by elevated WBC and radiographic findings.  Levaquin already
   administed in ED and she is on her 3rd Liter of NS at the time of this
   note.  Non-invasive blood pressures difficult to obtain due to
   tremulousness. She is making ~ 20mL urine per hour.  Other
   possibilities include recent MI or possible PE or obstructing renal
   stone causing pyelonephritis.
   - Broaden antibiotic coverage to Vanc/Cefepime now, renally dosed.
   Cipro to start in 48 hours
   - Rule out Flu with DFA; precautions
   - Sputum cultures
   - Continue NS to urine output and goal SBP >100; MAP>65
   - Monitor BPs this AM, place arterial line (technically challenging
   given tremor) if monitoring becomes difficult or BPs remain low
   - Regular heart healthy diet
   - Hold metoprolol, Lisinopril and Lasix & amiodarone
   - Start heparin gtt, LENIs, VQ Scan
   - Echo
   - Renal U/S
   2. (HC vs. Hospital Acquired) Pneumonia: The patient has radiographic
   evidence of a RLL PNA, HAP versus HCAP given history with associated
   left sided pleuritic pain.  She denies cough or fever.
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro as above
   - ABG to monitor respiratory status although she is satting well and
   not dyspneic
   3. Delirium with tremulousness: The patient has developed waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status in the past 24 hours per family report.  She has
   also developed new tremor at this time.  Her tremulousness can be due
   to new medications (Compazine) or neurontin overdose in the setting
   over worsening renal failure.  A possible neurontin overdose could also
   explain her worsening nausea.
   - Treat underlying infection as above
   - Hold compazine and neurontin
   4. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: The patient's Cr is elevated to 2.8
   with a baseline of 1.1-1.2, still elevated based on her size, weight
   and age.  Likely causes include pre-renal from poor PO intake or ATN
   from hypotension.  Worsening renal failure and subsequent neurontin
   overdose could also synergistically cause her renal failure.
   - Fluid rescussitation, PO Intake
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolyte monitoring
   - Repeat U/A with electrolytes and Urea
   - Renally dose meds
   - Hold Lisinopril and Lasix
   5. Anemia: A pre-operative baseline, but worriesome for
   hemoconcentration. Guaiac negative, no signs of bleeding or hemolysis
   given normal LFTs, but thrombocytosis concerning. Normal B12 in
   [**Month (only) 539**]
   - Repeat Hct today
   - Smear, Retic count, iron studies, b12 and folate
   - Type and screen; blood consent
   6. Thrombocytosis: The patient's thrombocytosis could be reactive from
   bleeding/anemia as above; essential or hemoconcentrational.
   - Repeat platelet count
   - Investigate anemia as above, monitor for bleeding
   7. s/p CABG: Complicated by postop atrial fibrillation, currently in
   Sinus. QTc 438.  Elevated Troponin difficult to interpret given renal
   failure; CK elevated from hemolysis
   - Repeat Troponin
   - Hold Amiodarone given hypotension
   - Appreciate CSurg wound care recs
   - Continue ASA, Statin
   8. Arthritis: Patient with chronic pain
   - Tylenol PRN add Tramadol PRN if pain not well controlled
   9. GERD: Continue Omeprazole
   10. Glaucoma: Continue Latanoprost

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Altered mental status (not delirium)
* Anemia
* Thrombocytosis

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Broadening antibiotic coverage to Vanc/Cefepime
* Ruling out influenza with DFA; taking precautions
* Sputum cultures
* Continuing normal saline (NS) to urine output and goal systolic blood pressure (SBP) >100 mmHg
* Monitoring blood pressures and placing an arterial line if monitoring becomes difficult or blood pressures remain low
* Holding metoprolol, Lisinopril, and Lasix
* Starting heparin gtt, LENIs, and VQ scan
* Echo and renal U/S

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis from pneumonia
* Worsening renal failure
* Bleeding complications from thrombocytosis
* Cardiac complications from hypotension and elevated troponin-T
* Respiratory complications from pneumonia
* Delirium and tremulousness from medications or worsening renal failure

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent potential complications and improve her clinical outcome."

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old lady with hypotension and radiographic evidence of
   pneumonia now two days out from rehab after a CABG. She is comfortable
   at this time.
   1. Hypotension: Possible etiologies of hypotension include poor PO
   intake and hypovolemia (as supported by history) or sepsis from a
   Pneumonia as supported by elevated WBC and radiographic findings.
   Levaquin already administed in ED and she is on her 3rd Liter of NS at
   the time of this note.  Non-invasive blood pressures difficult to
   obtain due to tremulousness. She is making ~ 20mL urine per hour.
   Other possibilities include recent MI or possible PE or obstructing
   renal stone causing pyelonephritis.
   - Broaden antibiotic coverage to Vanc/Cefepime now, renally dosed.
   Cipro to start in 48 hours
   - Rule out Flu with DFA; precautions
   - Sputum cultures
   - Continue NS to urine output and goal SBP >100; MAP>65
   - Monitor BPs this AM, place arterial line (technically challenging
   given tremor) if monitoring becomes difficult or BPs remain low
   - Regular heart healthy diet
   - Hold metoprolol, Lisinopril and Lasix & amiodarone
   - Start heparin gtt, LENIs, VQ Scan
   - Echo
   - Renal U/S
   2. (HC vs. Hospital Acquired) Pneumonia: The patient has radiographic
   evidence of a RLL PNA, HAP versus HCAP given history with associated
   left sided pleuritic pain.  She denies cough or fever.
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro as above
   - ABG to monitor respiratory status although she is satting well and
   not dyspneic
   3. Delirium with tremulousness: The patient has developed waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status in the past 24 hours per family report.  She has
   also developed new tremor at this time.  Her tremulousness can be due
   to new medications (Compazine) or neurontin overdose in the setting
   over worsening renal failure.  A possible neurontin overdose could also
   explain her worsening nausea.
   - Treat underlying infection as above
   - Hold compazine and neurontin
   4. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: The patient's Cr is elevated to 2.8
   with a baseline of 1.1-1.2, still elevated based on her size, weight
   and age.  Likely causes include pre-renal from poor PO intake or ATN
   from hypotension.  Worsening renal failure and subsequent neurontin
   overdose could also synergistically cause her renal failure.
   - Fluid rescussitation, PO Intake
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolyte monitoring
   - Repeat U/A with electrolytes and Urea
   - Renally dose meds
   - Hold Lisinopril and Lasix
   5. Anemia: A pre-operative baseline, but worriesome for
   hemoconcentration. Guaiac negative, no signs of bleeding or hemolysis
   given normal LFTs, but thrombocytosis concerning. Normal B12 in
   [**Month (only) 539**]
   - Repeat Hct today
   - Smear, Retic count, iron studies, b12 and folate
   - Type and screen; blood consent
   6. Thrombocytosis: The patient's thrombocytosis could be reactive from
   bleeding/anemia as above; essential or hemoconcentrational.
   - Repeat platelet count
   - Investigate anemia as above, monitor for bleeding
   7. s/p CABG: Complicated by postop atrial fibrillation, currently in
   Sinus. QTc 438.  Elevated Troponin difficult to interpret given renal
   failure; CK elevated from hemolysis
   - Repeat Troponin
   - Hold Amiodarone given hypotension
   - Appreciate CSurg wound care recs
   - Continue ASA, Statin
   8. Arthritis: Patient with chronic pain
   - Tylenol PRN add Tramadol PRN if pain not well controlled
   9. GERD: Continue Omeprazole
   10. Glaucoma: Continue Latanoprost

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old lady with hypotension and radiographic evidence of
   pneumonia now two days out from rehab after a CABG. She is comfortable
   at this time.
   1. Hypotension: Has not required pressors.  Etiology is likely
   hypovolemia vs sepsis from pneumonia.  Hypovolemia seems most likely at
   this time.  I am reassured that she does not have a PE based on
   indeterminate V/Q scan, negative echo and negative LENI
s, so we can
   stop the heparin.  While ideally we would to a CTA chest, her impaired
   renal function makes that risky.  She appears euvolemic now and
   presumably remains below her baseline blood pressure (on metoprolol and
   lisinopril at home), which may still be due to infection.  However her
   urine output and creatinine have improved, which is reassuring.  We
   will monitor closely through the day.
   - stop heprin
   - continue antibiotics for pneumonia as below
   - Try to correlate non-invasive BPs with arterial line.  If she can be
   monitored with cuff she can have the a-line out and go to the floor.
   - Hold metoprolol and lisinopril.
   2. (HC vs. Hospital Acquired) Pneumonia: The patient has radiographic
   evidence of a RLL PNA, HAP versus HCAP given history with associated
   left sided pleuritic pain.  She denies cough or fever.  We can treat
   with a seven-day course of antibiotics.  We will try to an induced
   sputum to obtain cultures to narrow coverage.
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for 7 day course.  Hopefully we can narrow based
   on sputum culture.  She has been MRSA positive in the past, so she will
   likely need vanco for all 7 days unless we can grow an organism.
   3. Delirium with tremulousness: The patient has developed waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status in the past 24 hours per family report.  She has
   also developed new tremor at this time.  Toxicology attending agrees
   that picture could be due to neurontin toxicity, and her improved exam
   today would support that.
   - Talk to family today about whether she is approaching her baseline.
   - PT consult to assess risk for falls
   - Hold compazine and neurontin
   4. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Creatinine improved this morning to
   1.7 from 2.8 on admission.  FENa calculated at 0.2%, supporting simple
   prerenal etiology and not ATN.  We will continue to trend towards
   baseline, with further work-up held unless she does not improve.
   - Euvolemic now, should be able to self-regulate with PO intake.
   - Trend Cr
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Hold Lisinopril and Lasix.  [**Month (only) 51**] require reduced lasix dose on
   discharge.
   5. Anemia: Patient is stably anemic with fluid resuscitation, making
   hemoconcentration unlikely. Guaiac negative, no signs of bleeding or
   hemolysis given normal LFTs. Retic count is depressed.  B12 and folate
   normal.  Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.  No further
   work-up at this time.
   - daily Hct while in hospital with transfusion for Hct<21.
   6. s/p CABG: Complicated by postop atrial fibrillation, currently in
   Sinus. QTc 438.  Elevated Troponin difficult to interpret given renal
   failure; CK elevated from hemolysis
   - Repeat Troponin
   - Hold Amiodarone given hypotension
   - Appreciate CSurg wound care recs
   - Continue ASA, Statin
   8. Arthritis: Patient with chronic pain
   - Tylenol PRN add Tramadol PRN if pain not well controlled
   9. GERD: Continue Omeprazole
   10. Glaucoma: Continue Latanoprost
   FEN: No further IVF, replete lytes PRN, regular diet
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin
   Access: peripherals and a-line.  A-line can be pulled if cuff pressures
   correlate.
   Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   Communication: Patient & Daughter [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1936**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 11582**])
   Disposition: To floor today early if cuff pressures correlate, later in
   day if pressures are stable.

Based on the provided progress note, I will summarize the patient's health progress and identify potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

The patient is an 84-year-old lady who was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), acute renal failure, and altered mental status. She has undergone a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and has a history of chronic pain, arthritis, and glaucoma. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 154/65 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 97% on nasal cannula.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Pneumonia:** The patient's pneumonia is being treated with a seven-day course of antibiotics, but there is a risk of antibiotic resistance and prolonged hospitalization.
2. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE):** Although the patient's V/Q scan was indeterminate, and she has not required pressors, there is still a risk of PE progression and potential complications such as respiratory failure.
3. **Acute Renal Failure (ARF):** The patient's creatinine has improved, but there is still a risk of ARF progression, electrolyte imbalance, and potential complications such as cardiac arrhythmias.
4. **Altered Mental Status:** The patient's mental status has improved, but there is still a risk of delirium, agitation, and potential complications such as falls and respiratory failure.
5. **Hypotension:** The patient's blood pressure is stable, but there is still a risk of hypotension, especially with the discontinuation of heparin and potential worsening of her underlying medical conditions.
6. **CABG Complications:** The patient has a history of postoperative atrial fibrillation, and there is still a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and potential complications such as stroke.
7. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient has a history of chronic pain, arthritis, and glaucoma, which may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as constipation, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.
8. **Infection Control:** The patient is at risk of developing hospital-acquired infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI).
9. **Medication Complications:** The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antihypertensives, and anticoagulants, which may interact with each other and lead to potential complications such as bleeding, hypotension, or cardiac arrhythmias.

Overall, the patient is at risk of developing various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or minimize these complications."

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old lady with hypotension and radiographic evidence of
   pneumonia now two days out from rehab after a CABG. She is comfortable
   at this time but is staying in the ICU as there are no hospital beds
   available.
   1. Health-care associated Pneumonia: The patient has radiographic
   evidence of a RLL PNA, HAP versus HCAP given history with associated
   right sided pleuritic pain.  She denies cough or fever.  She will
   require a seven-day course of antibiotics including vancomycin, so she
   will require IV access.
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for 7 day course.  We will increase dosing today
   based on improved renal function and check a vancomycin trough in the
   morning.
   - We will have her assessed for PICC placement so she can possibly go
   to rehab.
   2. Hypotension: Her blood pressures have improved, either because of
   treatment of her pneumonia, clearance of gabapentin or fluid
   resuscitation.  She appears to have difficulty drinking water because
   of her arthritis, but we will encourage PO intake as she has been
   negative for two days and was dehydrated on admission.  She is
   beginning to become hypertensive, but we will hold her home
   antihypertensives until we can be sure she is stable.
   - Continue to hold metoprolol and lisinopril.  Restart short-acting
   metoprolol if she is hypertensive.
   3. Delirium with tremulousness: She continues to improve.  Her symptoms
   were presumably due to acute infection and gabapentin overload.
   - PT consult to assess risk for falls and evaluate whether she should
   go home or to rehab.
   - Hold compazine and neurontin and talk to PCP about these medication
   changes.
   4. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Creatinine improved this morning to
   1.1 from 2.8 on admission.  Appears to have been pre-renal.  No further
   work-up for now.
   - Encourage PO intake.
   - Take-out foley catheter.
   - Hold Lisinopril and Lasix.  [**Month (only) 51**] require reduced lasix dose on
   discharge.
   5. Anemia: Patient is stably anemic with fluid resuscitation, making
   hemoconcentration unlikely. Guaiac negative, no signs of bleeding or
   hemolysis given normal LFTs. Retic count is depressed.  B12 and folate
   normal.  Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.  No further
   work-up at this time.
   - daily Hct while in hospital with transfusion for Hct<21.
   6. s/p CABG: Complicated by postop atrial fibrillation, currently in
   Sinus. QTc 438.  Elevated Troponin difficult to interpret given renal
   failure.  Had been on amiodarone for peri-operative A-fib.  We will
   restart amiodarone and defer to her out-patient cardiologist to decide
   the course.
   - Restart amiodarone
   - Appreciate CSurg wound care recs
   - Continue ASA, Statin
   8. Arthritis: Patient with chronic pain
   - Tylenol PRN add Tramadol PRN if pain not well controlled
   9. GERD: Continue Omeprazole
   10. Glaucoma: Continue Latanoprost
   FEN: No further IVF, replete lytes PRN, regular diet
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin now that IV heparin stopped.
   Access: PIVs.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, acute renal failure, and hypotension. She has a history of CABG and is currently taking antibiotics for her pneumonia. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 154/65 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a nasogastric tube in place. Her laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL, and acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may progress, leading to respiratory failure or sepsis.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, requiring dialysis or leading to electrolyte imbalances.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen, leading to shock or organ failure.
4. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen, leading to increased agitation, confusion, and risk of falls.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CABG and atrial fibrillation may lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
7. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and recent surgery may lead to infection, such as wound infection or urinary tract infection.
8. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid imbalance may worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances, dehydration, or edema.
9. Medication Interactions: The patient's multiple medications may interact, leading to adverse effects or decreased efficacy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for pneumonia and monitor for signs of improvement or worsening.
2. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust fluid management accordingly.
3. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust antihypertensive medications as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's mental status and adjust sedation medications as needed.
5. Continue to encourage oral intake and monitor the patient's fluid balance.
6. Monitor the patient's anemia and adjust transfusion therapy as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust medications as needed.
8. Monitor the patient's wound and adjust wound care as needed.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust medications as needed."
