   52 y/o F with HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia admitted with altered
   mental status.
   # Altered mental status: patient unresponsive to voice with roving eye
   movements.  Upon transfer to the MICU had twitching movements of the
   legs combined with rigidity of legs>arms; somewhat improved this
   morning.  Preliminarily, neurology consult feels that clinical picture
   likely represents toxic-metabolic insult (i.e. hepatic encephalopathy).
   Will continue workup for underyling infectious etiology, including ? of
   meningitis, though does not appear that patient has been febrile at OSH
   or here at [**Hospital1 5**]. Serum and urine tox screens negative on arrival to
   [**Hospital1 5**].

   lactulose/rifaximin via NG tube
   - Repeating urinalysis/culture (UA negative at OSH), blood cultures for
   infectious process
   - evaluate abdomen for ascites and consider diagnostic paracentesis
   today if appears safe to tap ascites
   - complete abdominal ultrasound today  to evaluate liver parenchyma,
   ascites, and portal vein patency
   - avoid benzodiazepines unless necessary for sedation while intubated,
   currently using propofol
   - hold SSRi and seroquel given possibility of NMS/serotonin syndrome
   - Add thiamine, folate, B12 for possible EtOH history
   - Obtain TFTs and RPR to rule out thyroid disorders or syphilis as
   causes of AMS
   # Tachycardia: Patient tachycardic to 120-130s on arrival to ICU.
   Differential includes hypovolemia (versus infectious (though afebrile
   currently). Pt is s/p 2L bolus of NS with no resolution of
   tachycardia.  FeUREA suggest pre-renal even though she did not respond
   to boluses.  ? role of primary neurologic component though neurology
   believes NMS/serotonin syndrome unlikely. Other considerations include
   pulmonary embolism though maintaining good O2 sats (though hypoxia not
   always present in PE); pericardial effusion, though no pulsus on A
   line.  Checked ECG that showed tachycardia but was otherwise similar to
   prior studies
   - Try another 1L bolus of NS
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - consider echocardiogram today or tomorrow if symptoms persist
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.8 per prior labs in
   OMR. Likely related to hypovolemia in setting of insensible losses and
   acute illness, especially since FeUREA showed a pre-renal picture
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - monitor urine output closely
   - While ultrasounding abd, can scan kidneys/ureters/bladder
   - Follow CK in case of NMS
   # HCV cirrhosis: Continue lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic
   encephalopathy. Platelets low but at recent baseline and INR up to 1.7
   which is also at recent baseline. LFTS otherwise appear to be at
   baseline with poor albumin (2.1 at OSH).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, and DM2. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, which is suspected to be caused by toxic-metabolic insult, possibly related to hepatic encephalopathy. She is intubated for airway protection and is receiving empiric antibiotics for meningitis, SBP, and UTI. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure of 150/83 mmHg, and SpO2 of 99%. Her laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and low albumin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and elevated ammonia levels suggest a possible severe case of hepatic encephalopathy. Aggressive treatment with lactulose and rifaximin is ongoing.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her immunocompromised state and the presence of an indwelling urinary catheter. Further workup is needed to rule out underlying infectious etiologies.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and low urine output suggest acute renal failure, likely related to hypovolemia and insensible losses.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be due to hypovolemia, infection, or primary neurologic component. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
5. Skin Lesions: The patient's skin lesions may be related to hypersensitivity reaction or chronic condition. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and management plan.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count is a concern, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and management plan.
7. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's history of DM2 and poor glycemic control suggests a high risk of nutritional deficiencies. Close monitoring of blood sugars and nutritional intake is necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Continue aggressive treatment for hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and rifaximin.
2. Perform a thorough workup to rule out underlying infectious etiologies, including meningitis, SBP, and UTI.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider further evaluation for acute renal failure.
4. Evaluate the patient's skin lesions further to determine the cause and management plan.
5. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider further evaluation for thrombocytopenia.
6. Implement a plan to manage the patient's glycemic control and nutritional intake.
7. Consider further evaluation for potential causes of tachycardia, including hypovolemia, infection, and primary neurologic component."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y/o F with HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia admitted with altered
   mental status.
   # Altered mental status: patient unresponsive to voice, with roving eye
   movements & twitching movements of the legs combined with rigidity of
   legs>arms. Neurology consult underway during transfer to the MICU and
   feel that clinical picture likely represents toxic-metabolic insult.
   Will continue workup for underyling infectious etiology, including ? of
   meningitis, though does not appear that patient has been febrile at OSH
   or here at [**Hospital1 5**]. Serum and urine tox screens negative on arrival to
   [**Hospital1 5**].
   - intubated for airway protection on arrival to the MICU
   - Prophylactically treating infection (meningitis, SBP, UTI) with vanc,
   ceftraixone
   - Will LP today to r/o meningitis --> will need FFP prior to LP due to
   INR 1.7.  Ordered 2 un FFP
   - Neurology consulted: feel most likely to be toxic metabolic, less
   likely meningitis or NMS/Serotonin syndrome
   - Noncontrast head CT showed no acute intracranial process; follow up
   final read
   - eeg in the AM
   - treat for hepatic encephalopathy aggressively with
   lactulose/rifaximin via NG tube
   - send repeat urinalysis/culture (UA negative at OSH), blood cultures
   for infectious process
   - evaluate abdomen for ascites and consider diagnostic paracentesis
   tonight if appears safe to tap ascites
   - complete abdominal ultrasound in the AM to evaluate liver parenchyma,
   ascites, and portal vein patency

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y/o F with HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia admitted with altered
   mental status.
   # Altered mental status: patient unresponsive to voice, with roving eye
   movements & twitching movements of the legs combined with rigidity of
   legs>arms. Neurology consult underway during transfer to the MICU and
   feel that clinical picture likely represents toxic-metabolic insult.
   Will continue workup for underyling infectious etiology, including ? of
   meningitis, though does not appear that patient has been febrile at OSH
   or here at [**Hospital1 5**]. Serum and urine tox screens negative on arrival to
   [**Hospital1 5**].
   - intubated for airway protection on arrival to the MICU
   - Prophylactically treating infection (meningitis, SBP, UTI) with vanc,
   ceftraixone
   - Will LP today to r/o meningitis --> will need FFP prior to LP due to
   INR 1.7.  Ordered 2 un FFP
   - Neurology consulted: feel most likely to be toxic metabolic, less
   likely meningitis or NMS/Serotonin syndrome
   - Noncontrast head CT showed no acute intracranial process; follow up
   final read
   - eeg in the AM
   - treat for hepatic encephalopathy aggressively with
   lactulose/rifaximin via NG tube

   for infectious process
   - evaluate abdomen for ascites and consider diagnostic paracentesis
   tonight if appears safe to tap ascites
   - complete abdominal ultrasound in the AM to evaluate liver parenchyma,
   ascites, and portal vein patency
   - repeat CXR in AM given concern for aspiration while patient was
   somnolent

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, and diabetes mellitus type 2, admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. The patient is intubated and receiving empiric antibiotics for meningitis, urinary tract infection, and sepsis. The patient has a number of potential medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Toxic-metabolic insult: The patient's altered mental status, twitching movements, and rigidity of the legs and arms suggest a toxic-metabolic insult, which may be related to the patient's underlying liver disease.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her underlying liver disease and immunosuppression. The patient's empiric antibiotics may not be adequate, and further workup is needed to identify the underlying cause of her infection.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and rigidity of the legs and arms may be related to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a common complication of liver disease.
4. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine is elevated, and she is at risk for acute renal failure due to her underlying liver disease and potential sepsis.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and elevated INR put her at risk for bleeding complications, particularly if she undergoes procedures such as a lumbar puncture.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation may not be adequate to manage her respiratory failure, particularly if she develops further respiratory complications.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and potential hypovolemia put her at risk for cardiovascular instability, particularly if she develops further cardiac complications.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of difficult-to-control blood sugars and her current liver disease put her at risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as ascites and bleeding.
9. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and potential toxic-metabolic insult put her at risk for further neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.

In summary, the patient is at risk for a number of potential medical complications, including toxic-metabolic insult, infection, hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, bleeding complications, respiratory failure, cardiovascular instability, gastrointestinal complications, and neurological complications."

* Eyes and conjunctiva: roving eye movements
* Cardiovascular: normal S1 and S2 heart sounds
* Peripheral vascular: normal radial and digital pulses
* Musculoskeletal: stiff and rigid
* Skin: not assessed
* Neurologic: responds to painful stimuli, roving eye movements, and upgoing Babinski reflex

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's compromised immune system and the presence of an arterial line and central venous catheter
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's respiratory acidosis and the need for mechanical ventilation
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to the patient's sinus tachycardia and the presence of multiple medications
* Neurological deterioration due to the patient's altered mental status and the presence of a head injury
* Infection or bleeding complications due to the patient's cirrhosis and the presence of an arterial line and central venous catheter
* Metabolic complications due to the patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 and the need for insulin therapy
* DVT or PE due to the patient's immobility and the presence of an arterial line and central venous catheter"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, remote IVDU, DM2, and recent hospitalization for acute mental status changes (AMS). She was transferred to the ICU due to her deteriorating condition.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* She is intubated and mechanically ventilated due to acute respiratory failure secondary to neuro dysfunction.
* She has a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 130 bpm and blood pressure of 142/76 mmHg.
* She has a temperature of 37.3°C and a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute.
* She has a SpO2 of 98% and a platelet count of 90 K/uL.
* Her laboratory results show an elevated lactate level of 2.7 mmol/L, which may indicate liver failure or sepsis.
* She has a serum creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, which may indicate acute kidney injury (AKI).
* Her serum albumin level is 2.8 g/dL, which may indicate malnutrition or liver disease.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Acute mental status changes, which may be secondary to severe hepatic encephalopathy, seizure, meningitis/infection, or other toxic metabolic insults.
* Acute respiratory failure, which may be secondary to neuro dysfunction or pneumonia.
* Sinus tachycardia, which may be secondary to sepsis, liver failure, or other underlying conditions.
* Acute kidney injury, which may be secondary to sepsis, liver failure, or other underlying conditions.
* Possible infection, which is pending with blood and urine cultures.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Empiric antibiotic coverage for meningitis, including ceftriaxone and vancomycin.
* Administration of lactulose to treat hepatic encephalopathy.
* Monitoring of urine output and fluid balance.
* Consideration of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) or other interventions to manage portal hypertension.
* Close monitoring of the patient's neurological status and consideration of EEG and lumbar puncture (LP) if indicated.

In summary, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications, including acute mental status changes, acute respiratory failure, sinus tachycardia, and acute kidney injury. She requires close monitoring and management of her condition to prevent further complications and improve her outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, remote intravenous drug use, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She was recently discharged from a nursing home and was found by her family to be more lethargic, leading to her transfer to the hospital. The patient is currently intubated and in the ICU due to worsening lethargy and unresponsiveness.

The patient's condition is complicated by the following:

1. Acute Mental Status Change (AMS): The patient's mental status has deteriorated, and she is unresponsive to stimuli. The differential diagnosis includes severe hepatic encephalopathy, seizure, meningitis/infection, or other toxic metabolic insults.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and her respiratory status is critical.
3. Sinus Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may be related to her underlying condition or a response to stress.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's urine output is minimal, and her renal function is compromised.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections, particularly pneumonia, given her compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization.
2. Sepsis: The patient's ARF and altered mental status make her susceptible to sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's underlying liver disease may continue to deteriorate, leading to further mental status changes and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's ARF and prolonged ventilation may lead to pulmonary complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or acute lung injury.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's sinus tachycardia and potential cardiac disease make her at risk for developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Empiric antibiotics for possible meningitis/infection
2. Lactulose to manage hepatic encephalopathy
3. Propofol for sedation
4. Mechanical ventilation for respiratory support
5. Fluid management to address ARF
6. Nutritional support via total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
7. Glycemic control with insulin sliding scale
8. Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

The patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent complications and improve her chances of recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   We had planned for bedside LP.  Pt has incision on LS spine and upon
   review of prior imaging of spine pt had fusion of L4-S1 with hardware
   in place.  Feel bedside procedure would not be optimal.  Will discuss
   with IR regarding fluoro guided procedure and talk with neuro regarding
   empiric CNS coverage as we added acyclovir to vanco/ctx, though pt ahs
   been AF, nl WBC, and we have low clinical suspicion for CNS infection.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, remote IVDU, and DM2, who was recently discharged from a nursing home to home and was found to be more lethargic by her family. She was brought to the emergency department and transferred to the ICU for worsening lethargy and unresponsiveness. The patient is intubated and has a head CT scan that was negative for bleeding. She has rigidity, roving eye movements, and possible seizure-like activity, and is only responsive to painful stimuli.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure of 142/76 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 98% and she is on a ventilator with a mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. Her laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 10.8 K/uL, platelet count of 90 K/uL, and creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include acute mental status change, acute respiratory failure, sinus tachycardia, and acute renal failure. The differential diagnosis for the mental status change includes severe hepatic encephalopathy, seizure, meningitis/infection, or other toxic metabolic insult. The patient is being treated with lactulose, ativan, and haldol, and is receiving empiric coverage for meningitis with ceftriaxone and vancomycin.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's infection workup is pending, and she is at risk for developing sepsis due to her immunocompromised state.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver function is compromised, and she may continue to experience worsening mental status changes due to hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure, and may require continued mechanical ventilation to support her respiratory function.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she may require dialysis to manage her acute renal failure.
5. Seizures: The patient's EEG is pending, and she may be at risk for developing seizures due to her possible seizure-like activity.
6. Infection: The patient's infection workup is pending, and she may develop an infection despite empiric coverage.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's liver function is compromised, and she may be at risk for developing gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Cardiac complications: The patient's sinus tachycardia may be a sign of cardiac complications, and she may require further cardiac evaluation.

It is essential to continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to identify any potential complications and provide appropriate treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y/o F with HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia admitted with altered
   mental status.
   # Altered mental status: patient unresponsive to voice with roving eye
   movements and alternating twitching and rigidity on admission.  Likely
   [**3-19**] hepatic encephalopathy as NH3 very elevated.  Head CT shows no
   acute process.  TSH c/w SICU thyroid
   - treating for hepatic encephalopathy aggressively with
   lactulose/rifaximin via NG tube
   - IR guided LP to r/o CSF infection, will give FFP and platelets prior
   to LP
   - Follow EEG read
   - Meningitis prophylactic treatment with Vanc/Cef/Acyclovir
   - Droplet precautions
   - Appreciate Neuro input
   - hold SSRi and seroquel given possibility of NMS/serotonin syndrome
   - Add thiamine, folate, B12 for possible EtOH history
   - intubated for airway protection on arrival to the MICU
   # Other infection
 Febrile overnight.  GPC in pairs and chains on
   blood culture.  Sources include ascites, endocarditis, CSF, or PNA.
   Current coverage is sufficient for most GPC with exception of VRE.
   This may also be a contaminant.
   - complete abdominal ultrasound today  to evaluate liver parenchyma,
   ascites, and portal vein patency
   - Follow culture and sensitivity; would add dapto if cultures show
   Enterococcus.
   - Will do abdominal tap this afternoon to r/o SBP
   # Tachycardia: Patient tachycardic to 120-130s on arrival to ICU.
   Previous records show HRs consistently under 100.  Has come down
   slightly with aggressive IVF, but now 6L up.  FeUREA suggested
   pre-renal even though she did not respond to boluses.  Vigileo SVV is
   ~7, suggesting fluid replete.  Current tachycardia may be related to
   anxiety and fever.  Also ? role of primary neurologic component though
   neurology believes NMS/serotonin syndrome unlikely. Other
   considerations include pulmonary embolism though maintaining good O2
   sats (though hypoxia not always present in PE); pericardial effusion,
   though no pulsus on A line.  ECG showed sinus tachycardia without
   non-rate related changes.
   - echocardiogram to r/o strain, endocarditis
   - continue to treat fever and anxiety
   # CBC:  All lines down in the setting of significant volume repletion.
   Vital signs not consistent with massive hemorrhage
   - Guiac stools
   - Recheck in PM to assess for stability
   - If continues to drop, would transfuse, r/o interabdominal/thigh
   bleeding with CT
   # Intubated: Goal to extubate once done with procedures for altered
   mental status w/o.  Favorable RSBI
   - Place NG tube for goal of d/c of OG tube
   # Acute renal failure:  Improving. Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.8 per
   prior labs in OMR. Likely related to hypovolemia in setting of
   insensible losses and acute illness, especially since FeUREA showed a
   pre-renal picture
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - monitor urine output closely
   - While ultrasounding abd, can scan kidneys/ureters/bladder
   - Follow CK in case of NMS
   # HCV cirrhosis: Continue lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic
   encephalopathy. Platelets low but at recent baseline and INR up to 1.7
   which is also at recent baseline. LFTS otherwise appear to be at
   baseline with poor albumin (2.1 at OSH).
   - Follow up liver recs
   # DM2: Patient with history of very difficult to control blood sugars
   on prior admission and high insulin dose requirements.
   - fingersticks q6h
   - sliding scale insulin with 1/2 dose lantus for now
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets < 100,000 which is baseline for her.
   - avoid heparin products
   - continue to trend
   - Use pneumoboots for DVT prophy
   # Skin: Diffuse pinpoint, erythematous, raised lesions that have the
   texture of sand paper.  Appears to be chronic, prior work ups suggested
   hypersensitivity reaction.
   # FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes prn, consider tube feeds this
   morning, IV fluid boluses for volume
   - Needs NG tube
   # Access: PIV X 3, 20 g x 2, 18 g x 1, consider CVL if necessary
   # Ppx: PPI per home regimen, pneumoboots, lactulose for BMs
   # CODE: Full.
   # Contact: Brother, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].
   # Dispo: ICU care for now (pt still intubated and on vent)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y/o F with HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia admitted with altered
   mental status.
   # Altered mental status: patient unresponsive to voice with roving eye
   movements and alternating twitching and rigidity on admission.  Likely
   [**3-19**] hepatic encephalopathy as NH3 very elevated.  Head CT shows no
   acute process.  TSH c/w SICU thyroid
   - treating for hepatic encephalopathy aggressively with
   lactulose/rifaximin via NG tube
   - IR guided LP to r/o CSF infection, will give FFP and platelets prior
   to LP
   - Follow EEG read
   - Meningitis prophylactic treatment with Vanc/Cef/Acyclovir
   - Droplet precautions
   - Appreciate Neuro input
   - hold SSRi and seroquel given possibility of NMS/serotonin syndrome
   - Add thiamine, folate, B12 for possible EtOH history
   - intubated for airway protection on arrival to the MICU
   # Other infection
 Febrile overnight.  GPC in pairs and chains on
   blood culture.  Sources include ascites, endocarditis, CSF, or PNA.
   Current coverage is sufficient for most GPC with exception of VRE.
   This may also be a contaminant.
   - complete abdominal ultrasound today  to evaluate liver parenchyma,
   ascites, and portal vein patency
   - Follow culture and sensitivity; would add dapto if cultures show
   Enterococcus.
   - Will do abdominal tap this afternoon to r/o SBP
   # Tachycardia: Patient tachycardic to 120-130s on arrival to ICU.
   Previous records show HRs consistently under 100.  Has come down
   slightly with aggressive IVF, but now 6L up.  FeUREA suggested
   pre-renal even though she did not respond to boluses.  Vigileo SVV is
   ~7, suggesting fluid replete.  Current tachycardia may be related to
   anxiety and fever.  Also ? role of primary neurologic component though
   neurology believes NMS/serotonin syndrome unlikely. Other
   considerations include pulmonary embolism though maintaining good O2
   sats (though hypoxia not always present in PE); pericardial effusion,
   though no pulsus on A line.  ECG showed sinus tachycardia without
   non-rate related changes.
   - echocardiogram to r/o strain, endocarditis
   - continue to treat fever and anxiety
   # CBC:  All lines down in the setting of significant volume repletion.
   Vital signs not consistent with massive hemorrhage
   - Guiac stools
   - Recheck in PM to assess for stability
   - If continues to drop, would transfuse, r/o interabdominal/thigh
   bleeding with CT
   # Intubated: Goal to extubate once done with procedures for altered
   mental status w/o.  Favorable RSBI
   - Place NG tube for goal of d/c of OG tube
   # Acute renal failure:  Improving. Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.8 per
   prior labs in OMR. Likely related to hypovolemia in setting of
   insensible losses and acute illness, especially since FeUREA showed a
   pre-renal picture
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - monitor urine output closely
   - While ultrasounding abd, can scan kidneys/ureters/bladder
   - Follow CK in case of NMS
   # HCV cirrhosis: Continue lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic
   encephalopathy. Platelets low but at recent baseline and INR up to 1.7
   which is also at recent baseline. LFTS otherwise appear to be at
   baseline with poor albumin (2.1 at OSH).
   - Follow up liver recs
   # DM2: Patient with history of very difficult to control blood sugars
   on prior admission and high insulin dose requirements.
   - fingersticks q6h
   - sliding scale insulin with 1/2 dose lantus for now
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets < 100,000 which is baseline for her.
   - avoid heparin products
   - continue to trend
   - Use pneumoboots for DVT prophy
   # Skin: Diffuse pinpoint, erythematous, raised lesions that have the
   texture of sand paper.  Appears to be chronic, prior work ups suggested
   hypersensitivity reaction.
   # FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes prn, consider tube feeds this
   morning, IV fluid boluses for volume
   - Needs NG tube
   # Access: PIV X 3, 20 g x 2, 18 g x 1, consider CVL if necessary
   # Ppx: PPI per home regimen, pneumoboots, lactulose for BMs

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, and altered mental status. She is currently intubated and on ventilatory support in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 100.8°C (38.2°F)
* Heart rate: 115-130 bpm
* Blood pressure: 114/51 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20-27 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.8 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count: 90 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
* Albumin: 2.8 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.9 mmol/L
* Troponin-T: 0.02 ng/mL
* TSH: 8.4 mU/L
* FT4: 1.1 ng/dL

The patient has been diagnosed with altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, and is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin via nasogastric tube. She also has a fever, tachycardia, and is being treated with antibiotics for a possible infection.

The patient's medical history includes HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, and a history of difficult-to-control blood sugars. She is also at risk for acute renal failure and has a history of hypersensitivity reactions.

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Unresponsive to voice
* Roaming eye movements
* Sclerae anicteric
* Mildly dry mucous membranes
* Nasogastric tube in place, foaming slightly at the mouth
* Coarse breath sounds bilaterally from the upper airway
* Tachycardic but regular
* No appreciable murmur
* Distended abdomen with normoactive bowel sounds
* Fluid wave present, no grimace to palpation
* Trace peripheral edema
* Dull pulses bilaterally
* Pinpoint, erythematous, raised lesions on the skin

The patient's laboratory results also show evidence of liver dysfunction, including elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that could arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and laboratory results suggest that she may be experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, which could worsen if not treated aggressively.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and laboratory results suggest that she may have an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure if not treated promptly.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's laboratory results show evidence of acute renal failure, which could worsen if not treated with aggressive fluid management and renal replacement therapy.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which could increase the risk of bleeding if not managed aggressively.
5. Hypersensitivity reactions: The patient's history of hypersensitivity reactions suggests that she may be at risk for future reactions, which could be severe if not managed promptly.
6. Liver failure: The patient's liver dysfunction could worsen if not managed aggressively, leading to liver failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is tenuous, and she may be at risk for respiratory failure if not managed aggressively.

Based on the information provided, the patient requires close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y/o F with HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia admitted with altered
   mental status.
   # Altered mental status: patient unresponsive to voice with roving eye
   movements and alternating twitching and rigidity on admission.  Likely
   [**3-19**] hepatic encephalopathy as NH3 very elevated.  Head CT shows no
   acute process.  TSH c/w SICU thyroid
   - treating for hepatic encephalopathy aggressively with
   lactulose/rifaximin via NG tube
   - IR guided LP to r/o CSF infection
   - Follow EEG read
   - Meningitis prophylactic treatment with Vanc/Cef/Acyclovir
   - Droplet precautions
   - Appreciate Neuro input
   - hold SSRi and seroquel given possibility of NMS/serotonin syndrome
   - Add thiamine, folate, B12 for possible EtOH history
   - intubated for airway protection on arrival to the MICU
   # Other infection
 Febrile overnight.  GPC in pairs and chains on
   blood culture.  Current coverage is sufficient.  This may also be a
   contaminant.
   - complete abdominal ultrasound today  to evaluate liver parenchyma,
   ascites, and portal vein patency
   - Follow culture and sensitivity
   - SBP is possible but holding off on tap of abdomen given
   thrombocytopenia.  Will do abd u/s
   # Tachycardia: Patient tachycardic to 120-130s on arrival to ICU.
   Differential includes hypovolemia (versus infectious (though afebrile
   currently). Pt is s/p 2L bolus of NS with no resolution of
   tachycardia.  FeUREA suggest pre-renal even though she did not respond
   to boluses.  ? role of primary neurologic component though neurology
   believes NMS/serotonin syndrome unlikely. Other considerations include
   pulmonary embolism though maintaining good O2 sats (though hypoxia not
   always present in PE); pericardial effusion, though no pulsus on A
   line.  Checked ECG that showed tachycardia but was otherwise similar to
   prior studies
   - Try another 1L bolus of NS
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - consider echocardiogram today or tomorrow if symptoms persist
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.8 per prior labs in
   OMR. Likely related to hypovolemia in setting of insensible losses and
   acute illness, especially since FeUREA showed a pre-renal picture
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - monitor urine output closely
   - While ultrasounding abd, can scan kidneys/ureters/bladder
   - Follow CK in case of NMS
   # HCV cirrhosis: Continue lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic
   encephalopathy. Platelets low but at recent baseline and INR up to 1.7
   which is also at recent baseline. LFTS otherwise appear to be at
   baseline with poor albumin (2.1 at OSH).
   - Follow up liver recs
   # DM2: Patient with history of very difficult to control blood sugars
   on prior admission and high insulin dose requirements.
   - fingersticks q6h
   - sliding scale insulin with 1/2 dose lantus for now
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets < 100,000 which is baseline for her.
   - avoid heparin products
   - continue to trend
   - Use pneumoboots for DVT prophy
   # Skin: Diffuse pinpoint, erythematous, raised lesions that have the
   texture of sand paper.  Appears to be chronic, prior work ups suggested
   hypersensitivity reaction.
   # FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes prn, consider tube feeds this
   morning, IV fluid boluses for volume
   # Access: PIV X 3, 20 g x 2, 18 g x 1, consider CVL if necessary
   # Ppx: PPI per home regimen, pneumoboots, lactulose for BMs
   # CODE: Full.
   # Contact: Brother, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].
   # Dispo: ICU care for now (pt still intubated and on vent)

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, and altered mental status. The patient was admitted with altered mental status, likely related to hepatic encephalopathy, and is currently intubated for airway protection.

The patient has been treated for hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and rifaximin via NG tube, and an IR-guided LP has been ordered to rule out CSF infection. The patient is also being treated empirically for meningitis with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated NH3 levels, suggesting hepatic encephalopathy
* Thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 38 K/uL
* Elevated liver enzymes, including ALT and AST
* Elevated bilirubin levels
* Hypoalbuminemia
* Elevated lactate levels

The patient's vital signs are:

* T 100.8°C
* HR 115 bpm
* BP 114/51 mmHg
* RR 20 breaths/min
* SpO2 98%

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Unresponsive to voice with roving eye movements
* Coarse breath sounds bilaterally from upper airway
* Tachycardic but regular, no appreciable murmur
* Distended abdomen with normoactive bowel sounds, + fluid wave, no grimace to palpation
* Trace peripheral edema, dp pulses 2+ bilaterally
* Pinpoint papular eruption covering lower extremities > upper extremities with excoriations, no interdigital tracking
* Unresponsive to voice with roving lateral eye movements, pupils sluggishly reactive bilaterally, no blink to threat, limbs less rigid than previously, less extensor posturing

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's fever and elevated inflammatory markers
* Acute kidney injury or acute renal failure due to hypovolemia and pre-renal azotemia
* Hepatic failure or worsening hepatic encephalopathy due to the patient's underlying liver disease and elevated liver enzymes
* Thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, due to the patient's thrombocytopenia and elevated D-dimer levels
* Skin breakdown or pressure ulcers due to the patient's immobility and poor nutrition
* Respiratory failure or worsening respiratory distress due to the patient's underlying lung disease and increased oxygen requirements
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock, due to the patient's tachycardia and elevated troponin levels."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, and altered mental status. She was admitted with symptoms of altered mental status, including roving eye movements, sclerae anicteric, and MM slightly dry. The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* T: 100.8°C (38.2°F)
* HR: 115 bpm (tachycardic)
* BP: 114/51 mmHg
* RR: 20 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 98%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 10.8 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 35.2%
* Plt: 90 x 10^9/L (thrombocytopenia)
* Cr: 1.2 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.02 ng/mL
* TCO2: 22 mmol/L
* Glucose: 7.45 mmol/L
* Amylase: 34 IU/L
* Lipase: 27 IU/L
* Lactic Acid: 1.9 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.8 g/dL
* LDH: 469 IU/L
* Ca++: 8.0 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.6 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.2 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Altered mental status: likely related to hepatic encephalopathy
* Thrombocytopenia: baseline for her
* Acute renal failure: improving, likely related to hypovolemia
* HCV cirrhosis: continuing lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
* DM2: history of difficult-to-control blood sugars
* Skin: diffuse pinpoint, erythematous, raised lesions (chronic, likely hypersensitivity reaction)

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Meningitis: IR-guided LP ordered to rule out CSF infection
* Sepsis: patient febrile overnight, with GPC in pairs and chains on blood culture
* Tachycardia: likely related to hypovolemia, infectious, or primary neurologic component
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): patient intubated for airway protection
* Pneumonia: patient on respiratory precautions
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): prophylaxis with pneumoboots
* Pulmonary embolism (PE): considered in differential diagnosis
* Pericardial effusion: considered in differential diagnosis
* Nausea and vomiting: patient receiving IV fluids and medications
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: patient receiving lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
* Hepatic encephalopathy: patient receiving lactulose/rifaximin and rifaximin via NG tube
* Renal failure: patient's creatinine is improving, but still requires close monitoring
* Infection: patient's WBC count is elevated, and cultures are pending

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
* IR-guided LP to rule out CSF infection
* Follow-up EEG read
* Meningitis prophylactic treatment with Vanc/Cef/Acyclovir
* Droplet precautions
* Appreciate Neuro input
* Hold SSRi and seroquel due to possibility of NMS/serotonin syndrome
* Add thiamine, folate, B12 for possible EtOH history
* Intubated for airway protection
* Continue to trend creatinine
* Monitor urine output closely
* Follow-up liver recs
* Continue to trend platelets
* Use pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis
* Consider tube feeds this morning
* IV fluid boluses for volume
* Consider CVL if necessary

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU care for now."

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y/o F with HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia admitted with altered
   mental status.
   # Altered mental status: patient unresponsive to voice with roving eye
   movements.  Upon transfer to the MICU had twitching movements of the
   legs combined with rigidity of legs>arms; somewhat improved this
   morning.  Preliminarily, neurology consult feels that clinical picture
   likely represents toxic-metabolic insult (i.e. hepatic encephalopathy).
   Will continue workup for underyling infectious etiology, including ? of
   meningitis, though does not appear that patient has been febrile at OSH
   or here at [**Hospital1 5**]. Serum and urine tox screens negative on arrival to
   [**Hospital1 5**].
   - intubated for airway protection on arrival to the MICU
   - Prophylactically treating infection (meningitis, SBP, UTI) with vanc,
   ceftraixone.  Will add acyclovir for HSV prophy
   - Will LP today to r/o meningitis --> will need FFP prior to LP due to
   INR 1.7.  Ordered 2 un FFP; repeat INR prior to LP
   - Neurology consulted: feel most likely to be toxic metabolic, less
   likely meningitis or NMS/Serotonin syndrome
   - Possibly very severe hepatic encephalopathy; very elevated ammonia at
   OSH
   - Noncontrast head CT showed no acute intracranial process; follow up
   final read
   - Plan for EEG today
   - treating for hepatic encephalopathy aggressively with
   lactulose/rifaximin via NG tube
   - Repeating urinalysis/culture (UA negative at OSH), blood cultures for
   infectious process
   - evaluate abdomen for ascites and consider diagnostic paracentesis
   today if appears safe to tap ascites
   - complete abdominal ultrasound today  to evaluate liver parenchyma,
   ascites, and portal vein patency
   - avoid benzodiazepines unless necessary for sedation while intubated,
   currently using propofol
   - hold SSRi and seroquel given possibility of NMS/serotonin syndrome
   - Add thiamine, folate, B12 for possible EtOH history
   - Obtain TFTs and RPR to rule out thyroid disorders or syphilis as
   causes of AMS
   # Tachycardia: Patient tachycardic to 120-130s on arrival to ICU.
   Differential includes hypovolemia (versus infectious (though afebrile
   currently). Pt is s/p 2L bolus of NS with no resolution of
   tachycardia.  FeUREA suggest pre-renal even though she did not respond
   to boluses.  ? role of primary neurologic component though neurology
   believes NMS/serotonin syndrome unlikely. Other considerations include
   pulmonary embolism though maintaining good O2 sats (though hypoxia not
   always present in PE); pericardial effusion, though no pulsus on A
   line.  Checked ECG that showed tachycardia but was otherwise similar to
   prior studies
   - Try another 1L bolus of NS
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - consider echocardiogram today or tomorrow if symptoms persist
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.8 per prior labs in
   OMR. Likely related to hypovolemia in setting of insensible losses and
   acute illness, especially since FeUREA showed a pre-renal picture
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - monitor urine output closely
   - While ultrasounding abd, can scan kidneys/ureters/bladder
   - Follow CK in case of NMS
   # HCV cirrhosis: Continue lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic
   encephalopathy. Platelets low but at recent baseline and INR up to 1.7
   which is also at recent baseline. LFTS otherwise appear to be at
   baseline with poor albumin (2.1 at OSH).
   - Follow up liver recs
   # DM2: Patient with history of very difficult to control blood sugars
   on prior admission and high insulin dose requirements.
   - fingersticks q6h
   - sliding scale insulin with 1/2 dose lantus for now
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets < 100,000 which is baseline for her.
   - avoid heparin products
   - continue to trend
   - Use pneumoboots for DVT prophy
   # Skin: Diffuse pinpoint, erythematous, raised lesions that have the
   texture of sand paper.  Appears to be chronic, prior work ups suggested
   hypersensitivity reaction.
   # FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes prn, consider tube feeds this
   morning, IV fluid boluses for volume
   # Access: PIV X 3, 20 g x 2, 18 g x 1, consider CVL if necessary

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, and a history of difficult-to-control blood sugars. She was admitted with altered mental status, which is likely due to toxic-metabolic insult (hepatic encephalopathy). She is intubated for airway protection and is being treated for potential infections, including meningitis, SBP, and UTI. The patient has a history of chronic skin lesions, which may be related to hypersensitivity reactions.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 100.8°F, heart rate of 115 bpm, and blood pressure of 114/51 mmHg. She has coarse breath sounds bilaterally, tachycardia, and a normal oxygen saturation. Her neurologic examination reveals roving eye movements, sluggish pupillary reaction, and decreased motor response.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.8 K/μL
* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 90 K/μL
* Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 22 mg/dL
* Alanine aminotransferase: 79 IU/L
* Aspartate aminotransferase: 87 IU/L
* Alkaline phosphatase: 105 IU/L
* Total bilirubin: 2.1 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.9 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.8 g/dL
* LDH: 469 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.6 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.2 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and elevated ammonia levels suggest the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy, which can be life-threatening if not treated aggressively.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her immunocompromised state, and the presence of meningitis, SBP, and UTI must be ruled out.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and her urine output is decreased, suggesting the possibility of acute renal failure.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may be due to hypovolemia, infection, or primary neurologic component.
5. Skin lesions: The patient's skin lesions may be related to hypersensitivity reactions or other underlying conditions, and further evaluation is necessary to determine their cause and management.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be due to her underlying liver disease or other underlying conditions, and further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause and management.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and she may require aggressive nutritional support to prevent further complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and liver function tests to assess the progression of hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Administer lactulose and rifaximin to treat hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Perform a lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis and other infectious processes.
4. Continue to treat the patient's potential infections, including meningitis, SBP, and UTI.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust fluid management accordingly.
6. Consider echocardiogram to rule out cardiac complications.
7. Monitor the patient's skin lesions and consider further evaluation to determine their cause and management.
8. Consider tube feeds and IV fluid boluses to support the patient's nutritional needs.
9. Monitor the patient's thrombocytopenia and consider further evaluation to determine the cause and management.
10. Consider adding thiamine, folate, and B12 to the patient's regimen to support her nutritional needs."

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y/o F with HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia admitted with altered
   mental status.
   # Altered mental status: toxic metabolic and UTI.  CSF and imaging
   negative.
   - treating for hepatic encephalopathy aggressively with
   lactulose/rifaximin via NG tube
   - Follow EEG read
   - Appreciate Neuro input
   - will treat UTI, cont lactilose/rifamixin
   - hold SSRi and seroquel given possibility of NMS/serotonin syndrome
   - Add thiamine, folate, B12 for possible EtOH history
   - intubated for airway protection on arrival to the MICU
   # Other infection
 Febrile overnight.  GPC in pairs and chains on
   blood culture.  Sources include ascites, endocarditis, CSF, or PNA.
   Current coverage is sufficient for most GPC with exception of VRE.
   This may also be a contaminant.  Insufficient ascietes to tap.
   - complete abdominal ultrasound today  to evaluate liver parenchyma,
   ascites, and portal vein patency
   - Follow culture and sensitivity; would add dapto if decompensating and
   cultures show Enterococcus.
   - Vanc/Ceftri
   - 10 day course for complicated UTI to [**11-9**]
   # Tachycardia: Has trended down over the past 24 hours, now under
   100.   Likely related to fever, anxiety.  Patient tachycardic to
   120-130s on arrival to ICU.  Previous records show HRs consistently
   under 100.  Has come down slightly with aggressive IVF, but now 6L up.
    FeUREA suggested pre-renal even though she did not respond to
   boluses.  Vigileo SVV is ~7, suggesting fluid replete.  Echocardiogram
   normal.
   - continue to treat fever and anxiety
   # CBC:  All lines down in the setting of significant volume repletion.
   Vital signs not consistent with massive hemorrhage.  Could also be a
   marrow suppressive effect of Ceftriaxone
   - Consider quinolone once speciated.
   - Guiac stools
   - Recheck in PM to assess for stability
   - If continues to drop, would transfuse, r/o interabdominal/thigh
   bleeding with CT
   # Extubated: ABG stable and good airway protection.  No need for
   reintubation
   # Acute renal failure:  At baseline today. Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.8
   per prior labs in OMR. Likely related to hypovolemia in setting of
   insensible losses and acute illness, especially since FeUREA showed a
   pre-renal picture
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - monitor urine output closely
   - While ultrasounding abd, can scan kidneys/ureters/bladder
   # HCV cirrhosis: Continue lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic
   encephalopathy. LFTs, INR, platelets at baseline
   - Follow up liver
   recs
   # DM2: Patient with history of very difficult to control blood sugars
   on prior admission and high insulin dose requirements.
   - fingersticks q6h
   - sliding scale insulin with 1/2 dose lantus for now, will increase to
   full dose once tolerateing Pos
   - consider [**Hospital1 772**] consult if difficult to control.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets < 100,000 which is baseline for her.
   - avoid heparin products
   - continue to trend
   - Use pneumoboots for DVT prophy
   # Skin: Improving Diffuse pinpoint, erythematous, raised lesions that
   have the texture of sand paper.  Appears to be chronic, prior work ups
   suggested hypersensitivity reaction.
   # FEN: Advance to full, diabetic diet, replete lytes prn
   # Access: PIV X 3, 20 g x 2, 18 g x 1
   # Ppx: PPI per home regimen, pneumoboots, lactulose for BMs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, and a history of altered mental status, who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of altered mental status, suspected UTI, and possible hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including:

1. Lumbar puncture under fluoroscopy, which revealed clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) without any signs of infection.
2. Treatment for UTI with ceftriaxone, which was switched to vancomycin due to the patient's history of allergy to ceftriaxone.
3. Extubation, which was performed due to the patient's improved respiratory status and good airway protection.
4. Placement of a nasogastric (NG) tube, which was removed and replaced due to patient-initiated removal.
5. Administration of lactulose and rifaximin for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy.
6. Treatment of fever with antibiotics and antifungals.
7. Administration of thiamine, folate, and B12 for possible EtOH history.
8. Monitoring of vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.
9. Performance of various laboratory tests, including complete blood count (CBC), blood cultures, and liver function tests (LFTs).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is on room air with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient's heart rate is 92 beats per minute, and her blood pressure is 126/66 mmHg.
* Neurological status: The patient is arousable, oriented to self, and denies pain.
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has a nasogastric tube in place, and her stool output is copious.
* Hematological status: The patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 42,000 per microliter.
* Renal status: The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever may indicate the presence of an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of HCV cirrhosis and altered mental status may increase her risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy, which could worsen her neurological status.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase her risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of invasive procedures or trauma.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen her overall condition and increase her risk of complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
5. Infection: The patient's history of UTI and possible ascites may increase her risk of developing a secondary infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's copious stool output and history of bleeding may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in the setting of invasive procedures or trauma.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of diabetes and treatment with insulin may increase her risk of hypoglycemia, particularly if her insulin dose is not adjusted properly.
8. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's acute renal failure and treatment with diuretics may increase her risk of electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia.

In summary, the patient is a 52-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, and a history of altered mental status, who is currently being treated for UTI, hepatic encephalopathy, and possible ascites. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including her history of diabetes, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. Potential medical complications that may arise include sepsis, hepatic encephalopathy, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypoglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances."

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y/o F with HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia admitted with altered
   mental status.
   # Altered mental status: patient unresponsive to voice with roving eye
   movements and alternating twitching and rigidity on admission.  Likely
   [**3-19**] hepatic encephalopathy as NH3 very elevated.  Head CT shows no
   acute process.  TSH c/w SICU thyroid
   - treating for hepatic encephalopathy aggressively with
   lactulose/rifaximin via NG tube
   - IR guided LP to r/o CSF infection, will give FFP and platelets prior
   to LP
   - Follow EEG read
   - Meningitis prophylactic treatment with Vanc/Cef/Acyclovir
   - Droplet precautions
   - Appreciate Neuro input
   - hold SSRi and seroquel given possibility of NMS/serotonin syndrome
   - Add thiamine, folate, B12 for possible EtOH history
   - intubated for airway protection on arrival to the MICU
   # Other infection
 Febrile overnight.  GPC in pairs and chains on
   blood culture.  Sources include ascites, endocarditis, CSF, or PNA.
   Current coverage is sufficient for most GPC with exception of VRE.
   This may also be a contaminant.
   - complete abdominal ultrasound today  to evaluate liver parenchyma,
   ascites, and portal vein patency
   - Follow culture and sensitivity; would add dapto if cultures show
   Enterococcus.
   - Will do abdominal tap this afternoon to r/o SBP
   # Tachycardia: Patient tachycardic to 120-130s on arrival to ICU.
   Previous records show HRs consistently under 100.  Has come down
   slightly with aggressive IVF, but now 6L up.  FeUREA suggested
   pre-renal even though she did not respond to boluses.  Vigileo SVV is
   ~7, suggesting fluid replete.  Current tachycardia may be related to
   anxiety and fever.  Also ? role of primary neurologic component though
   neurology believes NMS/serotonin syndrome unlikely. Other
   considerations include pulmonary embolism though maintaining good O2
   sats (though hypoxia not always present in PE); pericardial effusion,
   though no pulsus on A line.  ECG showed sinus tachycardia without
   non-rate related changes.
   - echocardiogram to r/o strain, endocarditis
   - continue to treat fever and anxiety
   # CBC:  All lines down in the setting of significant volume repletion.
   Vital signs not consistent with massive hemorrhage
   - Guiac stools
   - Recheck in PM to assess for stability
   - If continues to drop, would transfuse, r/o interabdominal/thigh
   bleeding with CT
   # Intubated: Goal to extubate once done with procedures for altered
   mental status w/o.  Favorable RSBI
   - Place NG tube for goal of d/c of OG tube
   # Acute renal failure:  Improving. Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.8 per
   prior labs in OMR. Likely related to hypovolemia in setting of
   insensible losses and acute illness, especially since FeUREA showed a
   pre-renal picture
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - monitor urine output closely
   - While ultrasounding abd, can scan kidneys/ureters/bladder
   - Follow CK in case of NMS
   # HCV cirrhosis: Continue lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic
   encephalopathy. Platelets low but at recent baseline and INR up to 1.7
   which is also at recent baseline. LFTS otherwise appear to be at
   baseline with poor albumin (2.1 at OSH).
   - Follow up liver recs
   # DM2: Patient with history of very difficult to control blood sugars
   on prior admission and high insulin dose requirements.
   - fingersticks q6h
   - sliding scale insulin with 1/2 dose lantus for now
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets < 100,000 which is baseline for her.
   - avoid heparin products
   - continue to trend
   - Use pneumoboots for DVT prophy
   # Skin: Diffuse pinpoint, erythematous, raised lesions that have the
   texture of sand paper.  Appears to be chronic, prior work ups suggested
   hypersensitivity reaction.
   # FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes prn, consider tube feeds this
   morning, IV fluid boluses for volume
   - Needs NG tube
   # Access: PIV X 3, 20 g x 2, 18 g x 1, consider CVL if necessary

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y/o F with HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia admitted with altered
   mental status.
   # Altered mental status: patient unresponsive to voice with roving eye
   movements and alternating twitching and rigidity on admission.  Likely
   [**3-19**] hepatic encephalopathy as NH3 very elevated.  Head CT shows no
   acute process.  TSH c/w SICU thyroid
   - treating for hepatic encephalopathy aggressively with
   lactulose/rifaximin via NG tube
   - IR guided LP to r/o CSF infection, will give FFP and platelets prior
   to LP
   - Follow EEG read
   - Meningitis prophylactic treatment with Vanc/Cef/Acyclovir
   - Droplet precautions
   - Appreciate Neuro input
   - hold SSRi and seroquel given possibility of NMS/serotonin syndrome
   - Add thiamine, folate, B12 for possible EtOH history
   - intubated for airway protection on arrival to the MICU
   # Other infection
 Febrile overnight.  GPC in pairs and chains on
   blood culture.  Sources include ascites, endocarditis, CSF, or PNA.
   Current coverage is sufficient for most GPC with exception of VRE.
   This may also be a contaminant.
   - complete abdominal ultrasound today  to evaluate liver parenchyma,
   ascites, and portal vein patency
   - Follow culture and sensitivity; would add dapto if cultures show
   Enterococcus.
   - Will do abdominal tap this afternoon to r/o SBP
   # Tachycardia: Patient tachycardic to 120-130s on arrival to ICU.
   Previous records show HRs consistently under 100.  Has come down
   slightly with aggressive IVF, but now 6L up.  FeUREA suggested
   pre-renal even though she did not respond to boluses.  Vigileo SVV is
   ~7, suggesting fluid replete.  Current tachycardia may be related to
   anxiety and fever.  Also ? role of primary neurologic component though
   neurology believes NMS/serotonin syndrome unlikely. Other
   considerations include pulmonary embolism though maintaining good O2
   sats (though hypoxia not always present in PE); pericardial effusion,
   though no pulsus on A line.  ECG showed sinus tachycardia without
   non-rate related changes.
   - echocardiogram to r/o strain, endocarditis
   - continue to treat fever and anxiety
   # CBC:  All lines down in the setting of significant volume repletion.
   Vital signs not consistent with massive hemorrhage
   - Guiac stools
   - Recheck in PM to assess for stability
   - If continues to drop, would transfuse, r/o interabdominal/thigh
   bleeding with CT
   # Intubated: Goal to extubate once done with procedures for altered
   mental status w/o.  Favorable RSBI
   - Place NG tube for goal of d/c of OG tube
   # Acute renal failure:  Improving. Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.8 per
   prior labs in OMR. Likely related to hypovolemia in setting of
   insensible losses and acute illness, especially since FeUREA showed a
   pre-renal picture
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - monitor urine output closely
   - While ultrasounding abd, can scan kidneys/ureters/bladder
   - Follow CK in case of NMS
   # HCV cirrhosis: Continue lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic
   encephalopathy. Platelets low but at recent baseline and INR up to 1.7
   which is also at recent baseline. LFTS otherwise appear to be at
   baseline with poor albumin (2.1 at OSH).
   - Follow up liver recs
   # DM2: Patient with history of very difficult to control blood sugars
   on prior admission and high insulin dose requirements.
   - fingersticks q6h
   - sliding scale insulin with 1/2 dose lantus for now
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets < 100,000 which is baseline for her.
   - avoid heparin products
   - continue to trend
   - Use pneumoboots for DVT prophy
   # Skin: Diffuse pinpoint, erythematous, raised lesions that have the
   texture of sand paper.  Appears to be chronic, prior work ups suggested
   hypersensitivity reaction.
   # FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes prn, consider tube feeds this
   morning, IV fluid boluses for volume
   - Needs NG tube
   # Access: PIV X 3, 20 g x 2, 18 g x 1, consider CVL if necessary
   # Ppx: PPI per home regimen, pneumoboots, lactulose for BMs
   # CODE: Full.
   # Contact: Brother, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].
   # Dispo: ICU care for now (pt still intubated and on vent)

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, and a history of altered mental status. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's condition has been unstable, with multiple episodes of fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status. She has undergone several procedures, including lumbar puncture, removal of an endotracheal tube, and removal of a central venous catheter. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's condition is likely to worsen if not treated aggressively with lactulose and rifaximin.
2. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing infection due to her immunocompromised state and the presence of multiple lines and tubes.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may require prolonged mechanical ventilation.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and the presence of ascites may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
7. Sepsis: The patient's fever and altered mental status may indicate the presence of sepsis.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and seizure activity may indicate the presence of neurological complications, such as hepatic encephalopathy or sepsis-related encephalopathy.
9. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's tachycardia and fever may indicate the presence of a pulmonary embolism.
10. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate the presence of cardiac complications, such as cardiomyopathy or arrhythmias.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to treat the patient's hepatic encephalopathy aggressively with lactulose and rifaximin.
2. Monitor the patient's laboratory results closely for signs of infection, including white blood cell count, blood cultures, and liver function tests.
3. Manage the patient's respiratory status with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust her fluid management accordingly.
5. Avoid heparin products due to the patient's thrombocytopenia.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely for signs of bleeding or infection.
7. Consider consulting a neurologist to evaluate the patient's altered mental status and seizure activity.
8. Consider consulting a cardiologist to evaluate the patient's tachycardia and hypertension.
9. Monitor the patient's platelet count closely and transfuse as necessary.
10. Consider performing an echocardiogram to evaluate the patient's cardiac function."
