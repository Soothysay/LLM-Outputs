   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname 3255**] is a 71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD,
   admitted with b/l PE in setting of  having bowel resection and vaginal
   hysterectomy one month ago.
   1.       PE.  Patient has large bilateral central PEs.  Currently has
   weaned down from 6LNC to 2L NC and satting well.  She is persistently
   hypotensive requiring 0.15 levophed to maintain her pressure and BPs
   improved this am.  Evidence of RV strain on EKG with elevated BNP,
   troponins, and noted to have dilated RV on CTA of the chest with RV to
   LVrationm approximately 2.  Given recent surgery and age, femoral line,
   and high risk  of bleeding, will defer thrombolytics for now since
   pressor and O2 requirements improved this am. If unstable, pressor
   requirement increased or hypoxia worsens will readdress need for
   thrombolytics but would like to avoid if possible. Gyn and [**Doctor First Name 91**] okay
   with lytics if necessary.  LENIs negative for DVT.  Per patient, up to
   date on colonoscopy and mammogram and there is no personal or family
   history of malignancy. PE most likely secondary to post-op setting and
   decreased ambulation, immobility. Elevated Lfts troponin, BNP
   concerning.
   -          Heparin drip with goal of 60-90
   -          Tylenol for chest pain
   -          wean O2 if able
   -          continue to trend cardiac enzymes
   -          close monitoring with consideration of thrombolytics if
   decompensates
   -          No filter since no LE DVT seen
   -          Echo to eval for RV thrombus since would be indicator for
   thrombolytics
   -
   2.       Hypotension.  Patient on numerous antihypertensive at home,
   but hypotensive here and requiring levophed.  Hypotension likely
   secondary to large PE, Rv strain. Also appears dry on exam, c/o thirst.
   Need to be careful with fluids to not overload RV but does need preload
   as well. Hypotension improved this am, so will attempt to wean
   pressors, give fluids.
   - NS bolus 1L
   -          levophed to maintain MAPs>60
   -          monitor BP
   -          hold antihypertensives
   -          consider thrombolysis if unstable, increased pressor
   requirement
          3 .   Elevated LFTs: Transaminitis likely secondary to shock
   liver from hypotension and pressor requirement. Unclear if hypotensive
   prior to arrival as well since had chest pain overnight prior to
   admission and presentation.
                - Follow. Maintain perfusion pressure
   4.       DM.  On metformin at home.
   -          ISS
   -          Follow fingersticks
   5.       GERD.
   -          IV PPI
   6.       CRI.  Likely secondary to longstanding hypertension requiring
   5 home antihypertensives.  Cr at baseline.
   -          renally dose all meds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female admitted with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) following a recent bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. She is currently on levophed to maintain her blood pressure, which improved this morning. She has evidence of right ventricular (RV) strain on EKG, elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and troponins. Her RV is dilated on computed tomography angiography (CTA) with RV-to-left ventricular ratio approximately 2. She is at high risk of bleeding, and thrombolytics are being deferred for now.

The patient has hypotension, likely secondary to large PE and RV strain, and is dry on examination with complaints of thirst. She has elevated liver function tests (LFTs) likely due to shock liver from hypotension and pressor requirement. She has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Thrombosis: The patient is at risk of developing further thrombosis due to her history of PE and RV strain.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen, leading to decreased perfusion and organ dysfunction.
3. Shock: The patient's elevated LFTs suggest shock liver, which may progress to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and increased work of breathing may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's RV strain and elevated BNP and troponins suggest cardiac compromise, which may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or cardiac failure.
6. Bleeding: The patient's high risk of bleeding may lead to life-threatening hemorrhage.
7. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and prolonged hospitalization increase her risk of developing nosocomial infections.
8. Metabolic complications: The patient's DM2 and hypotension may lead to metabolic complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue monitoring the patient's blood pressure, cardiac enzymes, and RV function.
2. Wean levophed and O2 if possible.
3. Consider thrombolytics if the patient's condition deteriorates.
4. Maintain perfusion pressure and fluid balance to prevent shock and organ dysfunction.
5. Monitor the patient's LFTs and consider liver support therapy if necessary.
6. Consider antibiotics if the patient develops signs of infection.
7. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy as necessary.
8. Consider cardiology consultation to optimize cardiac care."

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname 3255**] is a 71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD,
   admitted with b/l PE in setting of  having bowel resection and vaginal
   hysterectomy one month ago.
   1.       PE.  Patient has large bilateral central PEs.  Currently on
   6LNC and satting well.  She is hypotensive requiring levophed to
   maintain her pressure.  Evidence of RV strain on EKG with elevated BNP,
   troponins, and noted to have dilated RV on CTA of the chest.  Given
   recent surgery and age, will avoid lysis at this time, but would
   consider if she fails to improved with current management.  Gyn and
   [**Doctor First Name 91**] okay with lytics if necessary.  LENIs negative for DVT.  Per
   patient, up to date on colonoscopy and mammogram and there is no
   personal or family history of malignancy.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female admitted with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) in the setting of recent bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. She is currently on Levophed to maintain her blood pressure, which is hypotensive, and is also receiving Heparin sodium and Norepinephrine infusions. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.5°F)
* Heart rate: 108 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 80/55 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 29 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Blood glucose: 152 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is notable for tachycardia, increased work of breathing, and hypotension. She has a large bilateral central PE on imaging studies, with evidence of right ventricular (RV) strain on electrocardiogram (EKG) and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponins.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 13.8 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 257 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.42 ng/mL
* Total CO2: 19 mmHg
* Glucose: 152 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan are as follows:

1. PE: The patient has large bilateral central PEs, and is currently on 6 liters of nasal cannula oxygen and is saturating well. She is hypotensive requiring Levophed to maintain her blood pressure. Evidence of RV strain on EKG with elevated BNP, troponins, and noted to have dilated RV on chest computed tomography (CT) scan. Given recent surgery and age, will avoid lysis at this time, but would consider if she fails to improve with current management.
2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive requiring Levophed to maintain her blood pressure. Hypotension is likely secondary to large PE.
3. DM: The patient is on metformin at home and is being monitored for glycemic control.
4. GERD: The patient is receiving IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for gastroesophageal reflux disease.
5. CRI: The patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) likely secondary to longstanding hypertension requiring five home antihypertensives. Creatinine is at baseline.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypotension and tachypnea may lead to respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by her underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other respiratory conditions.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
* Sepsis: The patient's underlying chronic conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, may increase her risk of developing sepsis, which could be exacerbated by her current respiratory and cardiovascular instability.
* Renal failure: The patient's underlying CKD and hypotension may lead to acute kidney injury or worsening of her chronic kidney disease.
* Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy with heparin sodium may increase her risk of bleeding complications, such as hematomas or bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract.

In summary, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of bilateral pulmonary embolism, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and acute chest pain. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including Levophed, Heparin, and Norepinephrine, to manage their hemodynamic instability. They are also receiving Pantoprazole to prevent stress ulceration. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, and blood pressure of 80/55 mmHg. Their oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via nasal cannula, and their ABG results show a pH of 7.34, PCO2 of 33 mmHg, and PO2 of 320 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate, and liver enzymes. Their coagulation profile is abnormal, with a prolonged PT and PTT. Their troponin-T level is elevated, indicating myocardial injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's elevated lactate level and abnormal coagulation profile suggest the possibility of septic shock, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute PE and chest pain may lead to respiratory failure, increasing the risk of developing ARDS.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's elevated troponin-T level and abnormal electrocardiogram (EKG) results suggest the possibility of cardiac arrhythmias, which could lead to cardiac arrest.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant medications and their elevated liver enzymes may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient's abnormal coagulation profile and elevated liver enzymes may indicate the presence of an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory support closely.
2. Adjust the patient's medications, including anticoagulant and vasopressor therapy, as needed to manage their hemodynamic instability.
3. Consider the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis and gastrointestinal bleeding precautions.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and consider the use of anti-arrhythmic medications as needed.
5. Consider the use of antibiotics and antifungals to prevent and treat potential infections.
6. Consult with a pulmonologist and cardiologist to optimize the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a complex medical history. The patient's condition has deteriorated rapidly, with a code blue called due to cardiac arrest. The patient was intubated for airway protection and received TPA for pulmonary embolism. The patient's acid-base status is severely abnormal, with a pH of 6.9. The patient is on multiple pressor agents and has hyperglycemia. The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, with a respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 340.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued acidosis: The patient's pH remains severely abnormal, which can lead to further organ dysfunction and mortality.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is high, and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio is concerning. This can lead to further respiratory distress and failure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and the need for TPA for pulmonary embolism suggest a high risk of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia can lead to further complications, including dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of infections.
5. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's pulmonary embolism is a significant concern, and further complications, including pulmonary infarction and respiratory failure, are possible.
6. DVT: The patient's DVT prophylaxis is in place, but the patient's condition is high-risk for DVT formation.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's ICU stay and use of pressor agents increase the risk of stress ulcer formation, which can lead to bleeding and further complications.

Based on this information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust therapy accordingly. The patient's acid-base status should be closely monitored, and further interventions should be considered to address the patient's respiratory and cardiac status. The patient's hyperglycemia should be closely monitored, and insulin therapy should be adjusted as necessary. The patient's pulmonary embolism and DVT prophylaxis should be closely monitored, and further interventions should be considered to address these concerns."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple comorbidities and complications. The patient's condition has deteriorated significantly over the past 24 hours, with the development of acute respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism, and metabolic acidosis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (98.9°F)
* Heart rate: 105 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 148/89 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 32 inspirations per minute (ipm)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient is receiving invasive ventilation, with a tidal volume of 450 mL and a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute. The patient is also receiving pressor support with phenylephrine and has been initiated on a D10 drip for hyperglycemia.

The patient's laboratory results indicate the following:

* White blood cell count: 9.2-11.8 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 22.6-24.2%
* Platelet count: 166-153 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.6-2.1 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.44-0.81 ng/mL
* TCO2: 7-17 mmol/L
* Glucose: 147-381 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results indicate elevated levels of lactate, ALT, AST, and LDH.

The patient's medical history is significant for pulmonary embolism, which was diagnosed based on a trans-thoracic echo and confirmed by a CT scan. The patient has also developed acute respiratory failure, which is being managed with invasive ventilation. The patient's cardiac status is tenuous, with a history of cardiac arrest and ongoing pressor support.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is tenuous, and further deterioration could lead to respiratory failure.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and ongoing pressor support, which increases the risk of further cardiac events.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, which increases the risk of further complications, including respiratory failure and cardiac arrest.
* Metabolic acidosis: The patient's laboratory results indicate metabolic acidosis, which can further compromise cardiac function and increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are elevated, which can further complicate the patient's condition and increase the risk of complications.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and response to therapy."

 CHEST PAIN
   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now s/p 1 day s/p PEA arrest.
   # Hemodyanamics 1 Day s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely
   secondary to PE, however was also in the setting of worsening gap
   metabolic acidosis likely secondary to both lactic acidosis, less
   likely ketoacidosis (although BG in 300
s) and/or uremia (given pt
   essentially had GFR of 0 given no UOP). Following thrombolysis, pt able
   to be weaned from 3 pressors down to Neo.
   -          Cont to wean pressors as BP tolearated with goal SBP
   90-150s.
   -          Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, UOP as means to assess
   end-organ perfusion. Lactate is decreasing.
   -          Formal TTE today to assess RV function. Also in setting of
   troponin bump will assess LVEF
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis. Pt
s PTT remains > 60.
   -          Will restart Heparin gtt once PTT < 60
   -          TTE today to assess RV
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Was secondary to increased work of
   breathing in setting of gap metabolic acidosis and pt unable to
   compensate (pt
s HCO3  was down to 7).  Acid-Base Status now much
   improved following presumed lysis of clot and decrease in dead-space
   (given pt
s sudden pH normalization).
   -          Transition from AC to PS this AM as tolerated and re-assess
   this PM
   # ARF: Likely ATN secondary to hypoperfusion. GFR essentially zero
   given increase in Cr over past day and now no urine output. Pt now up
   13L since admission.
   -          No current indications for dialsysi given Acid-Base Status
   has corrected, K normal, Not yet fluid overloaded, No signs of uremia
   -          Will consider renal consult later today if pts BP still
   requiring pressers, and pt not urinating, for potential CVVH
   # Shock Liver: Likely secondary to hypoperfusion.
   -          No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   # Coagulopathy: INR continues to rise. Likely [**3-6**] to shock liver. No
   current indications for Vitamin K.
   -          Continue to trend
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in settting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so
   will likely remain elevated.
   -          No current interventions needed
   -          TTE Today
   -          Pt
s PTT remains >60
   # Hyperglycemia: FS 300-400
s overnight. Now on D10 drip at 50.
   -          Will decrease both dose and rate for better FS control.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female who was admitted with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) in the setting of having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. She developed cardiopulmonary arrest and was intubated. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including:

1. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's pH level was 7.16, and she had a high anion gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to lactic acidosis and/or uremia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient developed acute respiratory failure, which was secondary to increased work of breathing in the setting of metabolic acidosis.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced cardiac arrest, which was likely secondary to PE, and was treated with thrombolysis.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient had saddle pulmonary emboli, which were treated with thrombolysis.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient developed AKI, which was likely secondary to hypoperfusion.
6. Shock liver: The patient likely had shock liver, which was secondary to hypoperfusion.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient had a prolonged INR, which was likely secondary to shock liver.
8. Troponin bump: The patient had a troponin bump, which was likely secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension and increased RV strain.
9. Hyperglycemia: The patient had hyperglycemia, which was treated with an insulin drip.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Further deterioration of respiratory function: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she does not improve with treatment.
2. Worsening of AKI: The patient's AKI may progress if she does not receive adequate treatment.
3. Development of sepsis: The patient's compromised immune system may make her more susceptible to developing sepsis.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and troponin bump may increase her risk of developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy may increase her risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's compromised circulation may increase her risk of developing neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to continue to monitor her closely and adjust her treatment plan as needed to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple comorbidities and ongoing medical conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 105 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 148/89 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism, and respiratory failure. The patient's laboratory results indicate metabolic acidosis, with an elevated lactate level of 7.7 mmol/L. The patient's kidney function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL. The patient's liver function is also impaired, with elevated levels of ALT and AST.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and vasopressors. The patient has a central line, arterial line, and multiple peripheral IV lines. The patient is at risk for complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, and stress ulcer bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Worsening of respiratory failure, leading to further hypoxia and hypercapnia.
2. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest, due to the patient's pre-existing cardiac conditions.
3. Sepsis or septic shock, given the patient's history of cardiac arrest and pulmonary embolism.
4. Renal failure, given the patient's elevated creatinine level and impaired kidney function.
5. Hepatic failure, given the patient's elevated liver enzymes and impaired liver function.
6. Pulmonary embolism recurrence or progression, given the patient's history of acute pulmonary embolism.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia, given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and risk factors for infection.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their multiple medical conditions to prevent complications and optimize their clinical outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's 24-hour events, the following key points are noted:

1. The patient's condition deteriorated rapidly, with increased tachypnea, fatigue, and acidosis (pH 6.9). This led to intubation for increased work-of-breathing and subsequent cardiac arrest (PEA).
2. The patient was treated with bicarbonate, chest compressions, and TPA, which restored a pulse.
3. The patient has severe acidosis, hyperkalemia, and hyperglycemia, which are likely contributing to their respiratory and cardiovascular instability.
4. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, which may be relevant to their current condition.
5. The patient has a significant amount of fluid administered, with a total input of 8,428 mL and a total output of 7,827 mL, resulting in a fluid balance of 601 mL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acidosis, hyperkalemia, and hyperglycemia may exacerbate their respiratory failure, leading to further deterioration.
2. Cardiac instability: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and ongoing cardiac instability may lead to further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's acidosis, hyperkalemia, and hyperglycemia may be indicative of an underlying septic process, which could lead to further organ dysfunction.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acidosis, hyperkalemia, and hyperglycemia may also contribute to renal failure, which could worsen their overall condition.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and recent bowel resection may increase their risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.

Given the patient's complex condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve their overall outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who has experienced a massive pulmonary embolism (PE), cardiac arrest, and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamics: Stable, with improved right ventricular (RV) outflow and reduced need for pressors.
* Respiratory status: Intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a significant improvement in dead space after lytic therapy.
* Renal function: Dense acute renal failure (ARF) due to severe hypoperfusion.
* Liver function: Transaminitis likely due to profound hypoperfusion.
* Cardiovascular status: Cardiac arrest has been resolved, but the patient remains at risk for cardiac complications due to RV overload and hypoperfusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of ARF, requiring dialysis.
2. Development of cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure due to RV overload.
3. Pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism recurrence.
5. Stress ulceration or gastrointestinal bleeding due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and acidosis.
6. Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to insulin drip and altered glucose metabolism.
7. Infection or sepsis due to prolonged hospitalization and immunosuppression.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Weaning of pressors and repeat echocardiogram to evaluate RV overload.
2. Restarting heparin drip and follow-up echocardiogram to monitor for PE recurrence.
3. Continued mechanical ventilation and respiratory support.
4. Management of ARF, including dialysis if necessary.
5. Monitoring of liver function and potential need for liver support.
6. Cardiovascular monitoring for signs of cardiac complications.
7. Close monitoring of glucose levels and adjustment of insulin drip as needed.
8. Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU for further management and monitoring."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old female who presented with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She was successfully resuscitated and intubated. Her current status is as follows:

* Hemodynamics: stable, with improved right ventricular (RV) outflow, allowing for weaning of pressors.
* Respiratory: mechanically ventilated, with a significant improvement in dead space since lytic therapy.
* Renal: acute kidney injury (AKI) with dense ARF, likely due to severe hypoperfusion.
* Hepatic: transaminitis, also likely due to hypoperfusion.
* Metabolic: acidosis, with a pending issue of dialysis to manage volume overload.
* Cardiovascular: cardiac arrest, with ongoing RV overload and potential confounder of hemodynamic compromise.

Potential medical complications:

1. Continued volume overload and potential need for dialysis.
2. Ongoing RV overload and potential hemodynamic compromise.
3. Risk of further ARF and AKI.
4. Risk of hepatic dysfunction and transaminitis.
5. Risk of metabolic acidosis and potential complications.
6. Risk of cardiovascular instability and potential cardiac arrest.
7. Risk of respiratory failure and potential need for further respiratory support.
8. Risk of sepsis and potential multi-organ dysfunction syndrome.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to address these potential complications and optimize her care."

   Assessment and Plan
   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now s/p 1 day s/p PEA arrest.
   # s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely secondary to bilateral
   PE, however was also in the setting of worsening gap metabolic acidosis
   likely secondary to both lactic acidosis and/or uremia (given pt
   essentially had GFR of 0 given no UOP). Following thrombolysis, pt able
   to be weaned from 3 pressors down to Neo and levophed.
   -          Cont to wean pressors as BP tolerated with goal SBP 90-150s.
   -          Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, UOP as means to assess
   end-organ perfusion. Lactate and LFTs decreasing.
   -          Will likely need CVVH
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis on restarted heparin gtt. Pt
   PTT remains > 60.
   -          Continue heparin gtt goal PTT 60-80
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Was secondary to increased work of
   breathing in setting of gap metabolic acidosis and pt unable to
   compensate (pt
s HCO3  was down to 7).  Acid-Base Status now much
   improved following presumed lysis of clot and decrease in dead-space
   (given pt
s sudden pH normalization).
   -          Continue PS as tolerated
   # ARF: Likely ATN secondary to hypoperfusion and decreased forward
   flow. GFR essentially zero given increase in Cr over past day and now
   no urine output. Pt now up 13L since admission. Pt anuric with volume
   overload needs improved volume status for hemodynamics.
   -          Renal consult for CVVH
   -          f/u renal recs
   # Shock Liver: Likely secondary to hypoperfusion, improving.
   -          No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   # Coagulopathy: INR continues to rise. Likely [**3-6**] to shock liver. No
   current indications for Vitamin K.
   -          Continue to trend
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in settting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so
   will likely remain elevated.
   -          No current interventions needed
   # Hypoglycvemia: Pt had hyperglycemia so [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 3630**] [**Male First Name (un) **] insulin gtt thwen
   with hypoglycemia likely from liver disease so changed to sliding
   scale.
   -          Insulin sliding scale.
   # Low grade fever: Pt with low grade fevers. Possible sources include
   line (fem line), urine (has foley), superimposed PNA, possible
   aspiration during arrest.
   -          check u/a and cx

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was admitted with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and underwent a bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. She experienced a PEA arrest, which was likely secondary to bilateral PE and metabolic acidosis.

Current conditions:

1. Anuric: The patient has not produced any urine output, indicating acute kidney injury (AKI).
2. Hypotensive: The patient's blood pressure is 121/64 mmHg, which is slightly low.
3. Tachycardic: The patient's heart rate is 115 beats per minute (bpm), which is above the normal range.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation and has a respiratory rate of 0-25 inspirations per minute.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a pH of 7.38, indicating a metabolic acidosis.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated, indicating a coagulopathy.
7. Troponin bump: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension and increased RV strain.
8. Hypoglycemia: The patient had hyperglycemia, which was treated with insulin, and now has hypoglycemia likely due to liver disease.
9. Low-grade fever: The patient has a low-grade fever, which may be due to a variety of sources, including line infections, urinary tract infections, or superimposed pneumonia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's anuria and elevated creatinine levels indicate AKI. This may progress to acute renal failure (ARF) if not managed promptly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate and oxygenation requirements indicate respiratory failure. This may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if not managed promptly.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's history of PEA arrest and elevated troponin levels indicate a high risk of cardiac arrest.
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's history of PE and ongoing anticoagulation therapy indicate a high risk of recurrent PE.
5. Sepsis: The patient's low-grade fever and potential sources of infection (line infections, urinary tract infections, superimposed pneumonia) indicate a high risk of sepsis.
6. Liver failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and coagulopathy indicate a high risk of liver failure.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of bowel resection and ongoing anticoagulation therapy indicate a high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygenation levels.
2. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
3. Continue to treat the patient's metabolic acidosis with bicarbonate therapy and monitoring of lactate levels.
4. Continue to manage the patient's coagulopathy with anticoagulation therapy and monitoring of INR levels.
5. Consider renal consult for CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) to manage the patient's AKI.
6. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Consider anticoagulation therapy to prevent recurrent PE.
8. Monitor the patient's liver enzymes and coagulation profile to assess for liver failure and coagulopathy.
9. Consider gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis, such as proton pump inhibitors, to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now s/p 1 day s/p PEA arrest.
   # Hemodyanamics 1 Day s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely
   secondary to PE, however was also in the setting of worsening gap
   metabolic acidosis likely secondary to both lactic acidosis, less
   likely ketoacidosis (although BG in 300
s) and/or uremia (given pt
   essentially had GFR of 0 given no UOP). Following thrombolysis, pt able
   to be weaned from 3 pressors down to Neo.
   -          Cont to wean pressors as BP tolearated with goal SBP
   90-150s.
   -          Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, UOP as means to assess
   end-organ perfusion. Lactate is decreasing.
   -          Formal TTE today to assess RV function. Also in setting of
   troponin bump will assess LVEF
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis. Pt
s PTT remains > 60.
   -          Will restart Heparin gtt once PTT < 60
   -          TTE today to assess RV
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Was secondary to increased work of
   breathing in setting of gap metabolic acidosis and pt unable to
   compensate (pt
s HCO3  was down to 7).  Acid-Base Status now much
   improved following presumed lysis of clot and decrease in dead-space
   (given pt
s sudden pH normalization).
   -          Transition from AC to PS this AM as tolerated and re-assess
   this PM
   # ARF: Likely ATN secondary to hypoperfusion. GFR essentially zero
   given increase in Cr over past day and now no urine output. Pt now up
   13L since admission.
   -          No current indications for dialsysi given Acid-Base Status
   has corrected, K normal, Not yet fluid overloaded, No signs of uremia
   -          Will consider renal consult later today if pts BP still
   requiring pressers, and pt not urinating, for potential CVVH
   # Shock Liver: Likely secondary to hypoperfusion.
   -          No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   # Coagulopathy: INR continues to rise. Likely [**3-6**] to shock liver. No
   current indications for Vitamin K.
   -          Continue to trend
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in settting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so
   will likely remain elevated.
   -          No current interventions needed
   -          TTE Today
   -          Pt
s PTT remains >60
   # Hyperglycemia: FS 300-400
s overnight. Now on D10 drip at 50.
   -          Will decrease both dose and rate for better FS control.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female who has undergone a bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy, and has developed multiple complications. The patient had a PEA arrest and was intubated, and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 38.2°C (100.7°F)
* Heart rate: 115 bpm
* Blood pressure: 121/64 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 0 inspirations per minute (due to mechanical ventilation)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving norepinephrine and phenylephrine infusions to support blood pressure.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 11.5 K/uL
* Platelet count: 153 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.1 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.78 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 2.4 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.1 g/dL
* LDH: 2980 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 4.6 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: Obscuring right and left hilar densities, with an endotracheal tube 3 cm above the carina.

The patient's diagnosis includes:

* Saddle pulmonary embolism
* Acute respiratory failure
* Acute kidney injury (ATN)
* Shock liver
* Coagulopathy
* Troponin bump
* Hyperglycemia

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing to wean pressors as blood pressure tolerates, with a goal of systolic blood pressure between 90-150 mmHg.
* Trending lactate, creatinine, LFTs, and urine output to assess end-organ perfusion.
* Performing a formal transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to assess RV function.
* Restarting heparin infusion once PTT < 60 seconds.
* Transitioning from AC to PS ventilation as tolerated.
* Considering renal consult for potential continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) if the patient's blood pressure remains elevated and urine output remains low.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation
* Progressive acute kidney injury and need for dialysis
* Development of sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome
* Continued coagulopathy and bleeding
* Increased risk of cardiovascular events, including arrhythmias and cardiac arrest
* Hyperglycemic emergencies, including diabetic ketoacidosis
* Sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities. The patient has experienced a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) following lytic therapy, resulting in dense acute kidney injury (ARF), cardiac arrest, and respiratory failure.

The patient's hemodynamics have deteriorated, with a significant increase in heart rate and blood pressure, indicating shock. The patient is volume overloaded and not urinating, necessitating the use of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for volume management and acidosis correction.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with profound shock and acidosis leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy, and the ABG results indicate respiratory failure.

The patient's cardiac status is also concerning, with a history of cardiac arrest and ongoing cardiac dysfunction. The patient is receiving norepinephrine and phenylephrine infusions to support blood pressure.

The patient's laboratory results are concerning, with elevated creatinine, troponin-T, and lactate levels, indicating ongoing organ dysfunction. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) have peaked and are trending down.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Septic shock: Given the patient's history of cardiac arrest and ongoing organ dysfunction, there is a risk of septic shock.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac status is critical, and cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, are a potential concern.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's ARF is dense and ongoing, and there is a risk of further kidney damage.
5. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of pulmonary embolism and ongoing organ dysfunction, there is a risk of sepsis.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and ongoing bleeding risk make gastrointestinal bleeding a potential concern.
7. Stroke: The patient's cardiac status and ongoing hypoperfusion make stroke a potential concern.

The patient requires close monitoring and aggressive management of their comorbidities to prevent further complications and improve their chances of survival."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) post-lytic therapy, dense acute renal failure (ARF), and anuria. The patient's hemodynamics are currently stable, allowing for weaning of pressors, suggesting improved right ventricular (RV) outflow. However, the patient is volume overloaded and not urinating, making dialysis to manage volume status a concern in the next 12-24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Shock: The patient's hemodynamics are stable, but the risk of shock persists due to the massive PE and potential RV overload.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient is at risk of recurrent PE, and restarting heparin therapy is necessary.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and intubation and mechanical ventilation are necessary to manage profound shock and acidosis.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's ARF is dense and severe, and dialysis may be necessary to manage volume status and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function is compromised, and transaminitis is a concern due to profound hypoperfusion.
6. Cardiac Arrest: The patient is at risk of cardiac arrest due to the massive PE and potential RV overload.
7. Chest Pain: The patient is experiencing chest pain, which may be a sign of cardiac compromise or PE.
8. Volume Overload: The patient's volume status is a concern, and dialysis may be necessary to manage volume overload and electrolyte imbalances.
9. Infection: The patient is at risk of infection due to the prolonged hospital stay and invasive lines.
10. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamics and adjust therapy as necessary.
2. Restart heparin therapy to prevent recurrent PE.
3. Manage the patient's respiratory status with intubation and mechanical ventilation.
4. Consider dialysis to manage volume status and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Monitor the patient's liver function and consider liver supportive therapy.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and be prepared to manage cardiac arrest.
7. Manage the patient's chest pain with analgesics and consider additional therapy as necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's volume status and consider diuretics or dialysis as necessary.
9. Monitor the patient for signs of infection and consider additional antibiotics as necessary.
10. Consider VAP prophylaxis measures to reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical condition. The patient has a history of massive pulmonary embolism (PE) following lytic therapy, acute renal failure (ARF), and is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased respiratory rate. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows progressive volume overload, likely resulting in right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. The patient's fluid balance is concerning, with a total fluid input of 4,684 mL and output of 59 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, suggesting metabolic acidosis. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) have peaked and are trending down, indicating possible transaminitis. The patient's complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 11.5, indicating possible inflammation.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Shock: The patient is in shock due to massive PE, end organ injury to the liver and kidneys, and progressive volume overload.
2. PE: The patient has a history of PE, which was treated with lytic therapy. The patient is at risk for recurrent PE and will require anticoagulation therapy.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to profound shock and acidosis.
4. ARF: The patient has dense ARF due to severe hypoperfusion.
5. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis due to profound hypoperfusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recurrent PE: The patient is at risk for recurrent PE due to the presence of residual thrombus and the patient's underlying medical condition.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's hemodynamic instability and RV dysfunction increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen due to the patient's underlying medical condition and the presence of respiratory acidosis.
4. ARF: The patient's ARF can worsen due to the patient's underlying medical condition and the presence of volume overload.
5. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to the presence of invasive lines and the patient's underlying medical condition.
6. Organ dysfunction: The patient's liver and kidney dysfunction can worsen due to the patient's underlying medical condition and the presence of volume overload.

The patient's care plan includes the initiation of anticoagulation therapy, the use of vasopressors to support blood pressure, and the consideration of continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) to unload the RV and manage volume overload. The patient's nutritional needs will be met through the administration of enteral nutrition, and glycemic control will be achieved through the use of insulin therapy. The patient will require close monitoring of their vital signs, laboratory results, and hemodynamic parameters to ensure that their condition is stabilized and to prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66.5 kg male with a height of 62 inches, currently weighing 74 kg. He is admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including respiratory failure, acute cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism, and metabolic acidosis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 120 bpm, and blood pressure of 118/58 mmHg. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 696 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.35, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 36 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 137 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3) of 18 mmol/L.

The patient has a history of multiple medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, calcium gluconate, heparin, potassium chloride, and norepinephrine. He has also received multiple infusions, including pantoprazole and levophed.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) at 3.1 mg/dL, potassium (K+) at 18 mEq/L, and lactate acid at 1.8 mmol/L. His white blood cell count (WBC) is 11.6 K/uL, and his platelet count (Plt) is 156 K/uL.

The patient's physical examination is notable for the absence of peripheral vascular pulses and skin examination. His neurologic examination is also incomplete, with no assessment of movement, tone, or responsiveness.

The patient's ICU care plan includes nutrition with Nutren Renal, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that may arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and further deterioration may lead to respiratory failure, which could require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest history increases the risk of recurrent cardiac arrest, which could be fatal.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's pulmonary embolism may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure, cardiac complications, or even death.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction, particularly in the kidneys and liver.
5. Sepsis: The patient's incomplete physical examination and laboratory results suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to further organ dysfunction and mortality.
6. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest the possibility of acute kidney injury, which could worsen his overall condition and require dialysis.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill with multiple comorbidities, and his condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve his outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), admitted with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) following a bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. She had a cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) with lysis of the saddle embolus and was intubated. She remains intubated and sedated, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3. She has acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (AKI), and shock liver, and is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and vasopressors.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 118/58 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and she is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 696 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 11.6 K/uL
* Platelet count: 156 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 25 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Sodium: 135 mEq/L, potassium: 4.5 mEq/L, chloride: 108 mEq/L, bicarbonate: 24.9 mmol/L
* Liver enzymes: Alanine transaminase (ALT): 2620 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST): 966 IU/L
* Lactic acid: 1.8 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.1 g/dL
* Calcium: 7.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.9 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, and her respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute. She may develop respiratory failure due to inadequate ventilation or lung injury.
* Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has AKI, which may progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not managed properly.
* Shock liver: The patient has shock liver, which may lead to liver failure if not managed properly.
* Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR), which may increase the risk of bleeding.
* Troponin bump: The patient has a troponin bump, which may indicate cardiac damage or demand ischemia.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient had hyperglycemia and was treated with insulin, but may develop hypoglycemia due to liver disease.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient had a saddle pulmonary embolism, which may lead to recurrent pulmonary embolism if not managed properly.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient had a cardiopulmonary arrest, which may lead to cardiac complications if not managed properly.
* Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is receiving antibiotics, but may develop sepsis if not managed properly.

Overall, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications."

 CHEST PAIN
   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now s/p 1 day s/p PEA arrest.
   # s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely secondary to bilateral
   PE, however was also in the setting of worsening gap metabolic acidosis
   likely secondary to both lactic acidosis and/or uremia (given pt
   essentially had GFR of 0 given no UOP). Following thrombolysis, pt able
   to be weaned from 3 pressors down to Neo and levophed.
   -          Cont to wean pressors as BP tolerated with goal SBP 90-150s.
   -          Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, UOP as means to assess
   end-organ perfusion. Lactate and LFTs decreasing.
   -          Will likely need CVVH
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis on restarted heparin gtt. Pt
   PTT remains > 60.
   -          Continue heparin gtt goal PTT 60-80
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Was secondary to increased work of
   breathing in setting of gap metabolic acidosis and pt unable to
   compensate (pt
s HCO3  was down to 7).  Acid-Base Status now much
   improved following presumed lysis of clot and decrease in dead-space
   (given pt
s sudden pH normalization).
   -          Continue PS as tolerated
   # ARF: Likely ATN secondary to hypoperfusion and decreased forward
   flow. GFR essentially zero given increase in Cr over past day and now
   no urine output. Pt now up 13L since admission. Pt anuric with volume
   overload needs improved volume status for hemodynamics.
   -          Renal consult for CVVH
   -          f/u renal recs
   # Shock Liver: Likely secondary to hypoperfusion, improving.
   -          No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   # Coagulopathy: INR continues to rise. Likely [**3-6**] to shock liver. No
   current indications for Vitamin K.
   -          Continue to trend
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in settting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so
   will likely remain elevated.
   -          No current interventions needed
   # Hypoglycvemia: Pt had hyperglycemia so [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 3630**] [**Male First Name (un) **] insulin gtt thwen
   with hypoglycemia likely from liver disease so changed to sliding
   scale.
   -          Insulin sliding scale.
   # Low grade fever: Pt with low grade fevers. Possible sources include
   line (fem line), urine (has foley), superimposed PNA, possible
   aspiration during arrest.
   -          check u/a and cx
   -          consider resite fem line
   -          CIS
   # FEN: Not on TFs. Will start today. Replete lytes prn and recheck in

   1.       Shock: in setting of massive PE s/p lysis with significant end
   organ injury to liver and kidneys.
   Her hemodynamics have deteriorated in setting of progressive volume
   overload and likely RV dysfunction.
   We will try to get Neosynephrine off, use Levophed if HR tolerates.
   Repeat Echo to eval extent of RV overload bowing into LV and role of
   CVVH to unload RV. She is quite volume overloaded and no longer
   urinating and will likely need CVVH for volume management mainly today
   and eventual acidosis.
   2.       PE: s/p lytics, restart heparin drip, follow up Echo today for
   reasons above.
   3.       Resp Failure: on PSV - s/p intubation for profound shock and
   acidosis. Currently with sig improved dead space s/p lytics.
   4.       ARF: dense ARF in setting of severe hypoperfusion
   5.       Transaminitis: in setting of profound hypoperfusion
 LFTS
   have peaked and are trending down.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now s/p 1 day s/p PEA arrest.
   # s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely secondary to bilateral
   PE, however was also in the setting of worsening gap metabolic acidosis
   likely secondary to both lactic acidosis and/or uremia (given pt
   essentially had GFR of 0 given no UOP). Following thrombolysis, pt able
   to be weaned from 3 pressors down to Neo and levophed.
   -          Cont to wean pressors as BP tolerated with goal SBP 90-150s.
   -          Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, UOP as means to assess
   end-organ perfusion. Lactate and LFTs decreasing.
   -          Will likely need CVVH
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis on restarted heparin gtt. Pt
   PTT remains > 60.
   -          Continue heparin gtt goal PTT 60-80
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Was secondary to increased work of
   breathing in setting of gap metabolic acidosis and pt unable to
   compensate (pt
s HCO3  was down to 7).  Acid-Base Status now much
   improved following presumed lysis of clot and decrease in dead-space
   (given pt
s sudden pH normalization).
   -          Continue PS as tolerated
   # ARF: Likely ATN secondary to hypoperfusion and decreased forward
   flow. GFR essentially zero given increase in Cr over past day and now
   no urine output. Pt now up 13L since admission. Pt anuric with volume
   overload needs improved volume status for hemodynamics.
   -          Renal consult for CVVH
   -          f/u renal recs
   # Shock Liver: Likely secondary to hypoperfusion, improving.
   -          No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   # Coagulopathy: INR continues to rise. Likely [**3-6**] to shock liver. No
   current indications for Vitamin K.
   -          Continue to trend
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in settting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so
   will likely remain elevated.
   -          No current interventions needed
   # Hypoglycvemia: Pt had hyperglycemia so [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 3630**] [**Male First Name (un) **] insulin gtt thwen
   with hypoglycemia likely from liver disease so changed to sliding
   scale.
   -          Insulin sliding scale.
   # Low grade fever: Pt with low grade fevers. Possible sources include
   line (fem line), urine (has foley), superimposed PNA, possible
   aspiration during arrest.
   -          check u/a and cx
   -          consider resite fem line

   1.       Shock: in setting of massive PE s/p lysis with significant end
   organ injury to liver and kidneys.
   Her hemodynamics have deteriorated in setting of progressive volume
   overload and likely RV dysfunction.
   We will try to get Neosynephrine off, use Levophed if HR tolerates.
   Repeat Echo to eval extent of RV overload bowing into LV and role of
   CVVH to unload RV. She is quite volume overloaded and no longer
   urinating and will likely need CVVH for volume management mainly today
   and eventual acidosis.
   2.       PE: s/p lytics, restart heparin drip, follow up Echo today for
   reasons above.
   3.       Resp Failure: on PSV - s/p intubation for profound shock and
   acidosis. Currently with sig improved dead space s/p lytics.
   4.       ARF: dense ARF in setting of severe hypoperfusion
   5.       Transaminitis: in setting of profound hypoperfusion
 LFTS
   have peaked and are trending down.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She was admitted with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) following bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, which was likely secondary to bilateral PE and metabolic acidosis.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's acid-base status has improved following presumed lysis of clot and decrease in dead-space.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to increased work of breathing in setting of metabolic acidosis.
3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is essentially zero, and she is anuric with volume overload.
4. Shock: The patient is in shock due to massive PE, with end-organ injury to the liver and kidneys.
5. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, which was likely secondary to bilateral PE and metabolic acidosis.
6. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a saddle pulmonary embolism, which has been treated with lytics and restarted heparin drip.
7. Liver dysfunction: The patient has liver dysfunction, likely secondary to hypoperfusion.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated international normalized ratio (INR), likely due to shock liver.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further deterioration of cardiac function due to ongoing shock and volume overload.
2. Worsening of ARF, leading to further volume overload and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to ongoing respiratory failure.
4. Increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy.
5. Potential for further liver dysfunction and/or failure.
6. Increased risk of sepsis and/or septic shock due to low-grade fever and potential sources of infection.
7. Need for further interventions, such as continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH), to manage volume overload and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Weaning of pressors as tolerated, with goal systolic blood pressure (SBP) 90-150 mmHg.
2. Continuation of CVVH to manage volume overload and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Monitoring of lactate, creatinine, and liver function tests (LFTs) to assess end-organ perfusion.
4. Restarting of heparin drip to maintain a target partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 60-80 seconds.
5. Monitoring of troponin levels to assess cardiac function.
6. Adjustments to insulin sliding scale to manage blood glucose levels.
7. Evaluation of potential sources of infection, including line, urine, and superimposed pneumonia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure. They are intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 670 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 19 cmH2O, and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 cmH2O. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99%, and they are receiving supplemental oxygen at a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.9°C (100.3°F)
* Heart rate: 111 beats per minute (98-123 beats per minute)
* Blood pressure: 105/52 mmHg (71-153/70 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 12 breaths per minute (10-26 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 99%

The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and is receiving multiple medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, norepinephrine, and potassium chloride. They have also received multiple blood products and have a central venous catheter and a dialysis catheter in place.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 11.6 K/uL
* Platelet count: 156 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 25 mg/dL
* Sodium: 135 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.5 mEq/L
* Chloride: 108 mEq/L
* Calcium: 7.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.9 mg/dL
* Albumin: 3.1 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.8 mmol/L
* LDH: 446 IU/L
* Troponin-T: 0.78 ng/mL
* ALT: 2620 IU/L
* AST: 966 IU/L
* Alkaline phosphatase: 111 IU/L
* Total bilirubin: 3.3 mg/dL

The patient's chest X-ray shows a new right internal jugular central venous catheter in good position, bilateral pleural effusion, and mild pulmonary edema.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to pulmonary embolism and respiratory distress syndrome
* Cardiac arrest due to cardiac tamponade or arrhythmias
* Sepsis or septic shock due to pneumonia or other infections
* Acute kidney injury due to hypovolemia or nephrotoxic medications
* Electrolyte imbalances due to fluid shifts or medications
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulceration or coagulopathy
* Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility or underlying medical conditions
* Infection or sepsis due to central venous catheter or dialysis catheter placement

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to detect any potential complications and adjust their treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual who was admitted to the ICU with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE), respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest. The patient's hemodynamics have improved with the initiation of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), and their CVP is running between 14-18 mmHg. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a PSV mode. The patient's respiratory status has improved significantly since the initiation of lytics, but they still require assistance with breathing.

The patient has been diagnosed with metabolic acidosis, acute respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism, and chest pain. The patient's liver and kidney function have been compromised due to the severe hypoperfusion.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T, CK, and CKMB, indicating myocardial damage. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) have peaked and are trending down. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and their blood glucose levels are being monitored and controlled.

The patient's chest X-ray (CXR) shows an endotracheal tube (ETT) in good position, bilateral pleural effusion, and mild pulmonary edema.

Plan:

1. Continue CVVH to unload the right ventricle and improve hemodynamics.
2. Restart heparin drip to maintain anticoagulation.
3. Wean the patient off PSV mode and try to extubate when possible.
4. Continue CVVH to manage acute kidney injury (AKI).
5. Monitor the patient's liver function and electrolyte levels closely.
6. Continue stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
8. Continue glycemic control with insulin as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate if they are not weaned off PSV mode and extubated as planned.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac status can deteriorate if their hemodynamics are not closely monitored and managed.
3. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to their prolonged ICU stay and the presence of a central line.
4. ARF: The patient's kidney function can continue to deteriorate if CVVH is not effective in managing AKI.
5. Liver failure: The patient's liver function can continue to deteriorate if they do not receive adequate treatment for their liver injury.
6. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk of developing another pulmonary embolism if they do not receive adequate anticoagulation.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing a DVT if they do not receive adequate prophylaxis.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and improve their chances of survival."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE), respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest. The patient's hemodynamics have improved with the initiation of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), but they still require mechanical ventilation and have persistent right ventricular overload. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to the PE, and they are at risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and they have evidence of liver and kidney injury. The patient's metabolic acidosis is being managed with CVVH, and their glycemic control is being monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and they are at risk for developing ARDS. Close monitoring of their respiratory status and potential weaning from mechanical ventilation is essential.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and they are at risk for cardiac arrest. Continuous monitoring of their cardiac status and prompt intervention in the event of cardiac arrest are crucial.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's kidney function is compromised, and they are at risk for developing AKI. Close monitoring of their renal function and potential initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) are essential.
4. Liver injury: The patient's liver function is compromised, and they are at risk for developing liver failure. Close monitoring of their liver function and potential initiation of liver support therapy are essential.
5. Sepsis: The patient's compromised immune function and presence of a central line make them at risk for developing sepsis. Close monitoring of their temperature, white blood cell count, and potential initiation of antimicrobial therapy are essential.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's presence of a central line and immobility make them at risk for developing DVT. Prophylactic anticoagulation and close monitoring of their lower extremities are essential.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness and presence of a central line make them at risk for developing stress ulcer. Prophylactic acid suppression therapy and close monitoring of their gastrointestinal status are essential."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU with massive pulmonary embolism (PE), respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest. The patient has undergone various treatments, including dialysis catheter placement, multi-lumen catheter placement, and respiratory support with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 105/52 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on 40% FiO2.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Prolonged respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and prolonged respiratory failure can lead to further complications, such as hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, and the risk of recurrent cardiac arrest is high. Cardiac arrest can lead to brain damage, organ failure, and mortality.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to the presence of multiple lines, catheters, and respiratory support. Sepsis can lead to organ failure, shock, and mortality.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's kidney function is compromised, and acute kidney injury can lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalance, acidosis, and mortality.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's coagulation status is compromised, and gastrointestinal bleeding can occur, leading to further complications, such as hypovolemic shock and mortality.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: The patient's respiratory support can lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia, which can be a serious complication.
7. Catheter-related complications: The patient has multiple catheters and lines, which can lead to catheter-related complications, such as infection, bleeding, and embolism.

Based on the patient's critical condition and potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and treatment response. The patient requires ongoing respiratory support, cardiovascular monitoring, and hemodynamic management to prevent further complications and improve outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-inch tall, 78.1 kg male who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of respiratory failure, acute cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism, and hyperglycemia. He has been receiving mechanical ventilation and sedation, which was recently discontinued. He has also been receiving infusions of Heparin, Calcium Gluconate, and Potassium Chloride through CRRT. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, and blood pressure of 96/52 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy through an endotracheal tube and has a respiratory rate of 15 inspirations per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatinine levels, as well as decreased albumin and potassium levels. His blood glucose level is elevated, and he has a diagnosis of hyperglycemia. He is also at risk for acidosis and respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 15 inspirations per minute, which is within the normal range. However, his respiratory support is still required, and he is at risk for respiratory failure if his respiratory function deteriorates.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, and his cardiac rhythm is currently sinus tachycardia. He is at risk for recurrent cardiac arrest if his cardiac function deteriorates.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, which is a potential life-threatening condition. He is at risk for further complications, such as pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has a diagnosis of hyperglycemia, which is a potential risk factor for complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar nonketotic coma.
5. Acidosis: The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine levels, which are indicative of acidosis. He is at risk for further complications, such as respiratory failure and cardiac arrest, if his acidosis is not managed effectively.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, which increases his risk for infection. He is at risk for pneumonia, sepsis, and other infections if his respiratory function deteriorates or if he develops a secondary infection.
7. DVT: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to his immobility and underlying medical conditions. He is at risk for pulmonary embolism if a DVT develops and breaks loose.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to his critical illness and the use of corticosteroids. He is at risk for bleeding and other complications if a stress ulcer develops.
9. VAP: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to his prolonged mechanical ventilation and the use of endotracheal tubes. He is at risk for respiratory failure and other complications if VAP develops."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current health status as follows:

The 71-year-old female patient is still intubated and sedated in the ICU, three days after being admitted with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) following a bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. She had a previous cardiac arrest and was found to have acidosis, metabolic respiratory failure, and acute cardiac arrest.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 101 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 96/52 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 100%, and she is receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 10.7-12.3 K/μL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 8.3-8.5 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 158-107 K/μL
* Creatinine (Cr): 2.7-2.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 18-20 mg/dL
* Glucose: 161-179 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Intubated and sedated
* Pinpoint pupils
* Tachycardic
* Loud P2 with RV heave
* Warm, well-perfused extremities
* 2+ edema
* Soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present
* Ostomy site in the left lower quadrant (LLQ)

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still acute, and she is at risk for further respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac status is still unstable, and she is at risk for further cardiac arrest.
3. Sepsis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, and she has a central line, which increases her risk for sepsis.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and she is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's lactate levels are elevated, and she is at risk for further metabolic acidosis.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated, and she is at risk for bleeding.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are fluctuating, and she is at risk for hypoglycemia.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis, but she is still at risk for developing stress ulcers.
9. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient has a central line and is at risk for developing VTE.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Weaning of pressors as tolerated
2. Trending of lactate, creatinine, and liver function tests (LFTs) to assess end-organ perfusion
3. Continuing CVVH to decrease preload burden on the right ventricle (RV)
4. Weaning of sedation
5. Continuing heparin gtt to prevent VTE
6. Monitoring of the patient's cardiac status
7. Trending of the patient's glucose levels and adjusting insulin therapy as needed
8. Monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and adjusting ventilator settings as needed
9. Continuing stress ulcer prophylaxis"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was admitted with bilateral pulmonary emboli (PE) in the setting of bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. The patient suffered a cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for several conditions, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her oxygen saturation is 100%, and her respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and has a creatinine level of 2.7 mg/dL.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a yeast infection in her urine and is being treated with ciprofloxacin.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient has a history of hyperglycemia and is being treated with insulin.
5. Cardiac arrest: The patient suffered a cardiac arrest and is being monitored closely for signs of cardiac instability.

The patient's current medications include:

1. Heparin sodium: 900 units/hour
2. Calcium gluconate (CRRT): 1.2 grams/hour
3. Potassium chloride (CRRT): 3 mEq/hour
4. Pantoprazole (Protonix): 10 mg every 12 hours
5. Ciprofloxacin: discontinued due to yeast infection
6. Insulin: sliding scale

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

1. White blood cell count: 10.7 K/uL
2. Hemoglobin: 8.3 g/dL
3. Platelet count: 158 K/uL
4. Creatinine: 2.7 mg/dL
5. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 18 mg/dL
6. Serum glucose: 161 mg/dL
7. Serum electrolytes: sodium 133 mmol/L, potassium 5.0 mmol/L, chloride 18 mmol/L
8. Liver function tests (LFTs): alanine transaminase (ALT) 1573 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 283 IU/L
9. Troponin-T: 0.78 ng/mL

The patient's physical examination is as follows:

1. General appearance: intubated, sedated, and arousable
2. Cardiovascular: tachycardic, with a loud P2 and RV heave
3. Respiratory: clear anteriorly, coarse bilateral breath sounds postero-laterally
4. Abdominal: soft, non-tender, with bowel sounds present and distended ostomy
5. Neurologic: intubated, opens eyes to command, but does not follow commands

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: the patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying lung disease and the use of mechanical ventilation.
2. AKI: the patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she is at risk for further kidney damage due to her underlying medical conditions.
3. Sepsis: the patient has a yeast infection in her urine and is at risk for further sepsis.
4. Cardiac arrest: the patient suffered a cardiac arrest and is at risk for further cardiac instability.
5. Hypoglycemia: the patient has a history of hyperglycemia and is at risk for hypoglycemia due to her insulin therapy.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely and adjusting her treatment plan as necessary to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was admitted with bilateral pulmonary emboli (PE) in the setting of bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy, and subsequently experienced a cardiac arrest with lysis of the saddle embolus.

Current medical conditions:

* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
* Cardiac arrest
* Pulmonary embolism (PE), acute
* Chest pain
* Hyperglycemia
* Acidosis, metabolic
* Shock liver (secondary to hypoperfusion)
* Coagulopathy (likely secondary to shock liver)
* Troponin bump (likely secondary to demand ischemia and increased RV strain)

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on CPAP/PSV, and may require reinstitution of AC ventilation if her respiratory status worsens.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient has already experienced a cardiac arrest, and further cardiac events are possible.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient has had a saddle PE and is currently on heparin, but may require further anticoagulation or thrombolytic therapy.
* Chest pain: The patient is experiencing chest pain, which may be related to the PE or other underlying conditions.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient has had hyperglycemia, which may worsen if not managed properly.
* Acidosis, metabolic: The patient has metabolic acidosis, which may worsen if not managed properly.
* Shock liver: The patient has shock liver, which may worsen if not managed properly.
* Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy, which may worsen if not managed properly.
* Troponin bump: The patient has a troponin bump, which may be related to demand ischemia and increased RV strain.

Assessment and plan:

* Continue to trend lactate, creatinine, and liver function tests (LFTs) to assess end-organ perfusion.
* Continue CVVH to decrease preload burden on the right ventricle (RV).
* Repeat echo after CVVH volume removal and return of hemodynamic stability.
* Continue heparin gtt to maintain a PTT of 60-80.
* Monitor respiratory status and O2 sats, and reinstitute AC ventilation as necessary.
* Continue CVVH to manage acute renal failure (ARF).
* Trend coagulopathy and consider Vitamin K if necessary.
* Monitor troponin levels and manage any further cardiac events.
* Continue insulin sliding scale to manage hyperglycemia.
* Monitor for signs of hypoglycemia and adjust insulin therapy as necessary.
* Continue prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a chief complaint of shock, massive pulmonary embolism (PE), and acute respiratory failure (ARF). The patient's hemodynamics have improved with the initiation of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), but they still require ongoing supportive care. The patient's respiratory status has also improved with the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The patient's acidosis has been managed with CVVH, and their transaminitis is trending down.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, and they require ongoing mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and they may be at risk for further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) is severe, and they may require ongoing renal replacement therapy to manage their fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Sepsis: The patient's hypoperfusion and acidosis make them vulnerable to sepsis, which could lead to further organ dysfunction and mortality.
5. Bleeding Complications: The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia make them at risk for bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's hypoperfusion and acidosis may lead to neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or encephalopathy.
7. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization make them susceptible to infection, which could lead to further organ dysfunction and mortality.

Overall, the patient requires ongoing intensive care to manage their complex medical condition and prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of shock, massive pulmonary embolism (PE), and acute respiratory failure (ARF). They have been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and are currently receiving mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH), and vasopressor support. The patient's hemodynamics have improved slightly, but they remain at risk for cardiac arrest and end-organ injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac status is precarious, and they are at high risk for cardiac arrest due to their underlying conditions and medication regimen.
2. End-Organ Injury: The patient's kidneys and liver are already showing signs of injury, and further damage could occur if their blood pressure is not carefully managed.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and they require continued mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation.
4. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's massive PE is a significant risk factor for further complications, including cardiac arrest and end-organ damage.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and they are at risk for further hyperglycemic episodes if their glucose control is not managed effectively.
6. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is a concern, and they require close monitoring to ensure that their acid-base balance is maintained.
7. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, and they are at risk for further liver damage if their hypoperfusion is not addressed.
8. Delirium: The patient's mental status is altered, and they are at risk for delirium due to their sedation regimen and underlying medical conditions.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to closely monitor the patient's hemodynamics, blood pressure, and cardiac rhythm to prevent cardiac arrest.
2. Adjust the patient's vasopressor support as needed to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Continue CVVH to manage the patient's fluid status and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust their mechanical ventilation settings as needed.
5. Manage the patient's hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis through insulin and bicarbonate therapy, respectively.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's liver enzymes and adjust their medication regimen as needed to prevent further liver damage.
7. Consider performing a head CT to rule out focal findings in the patient's altered mental status.
8. Continue to communicate with the patient's husband and provide regular updates on their condition."

If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now 4 days s/p PEA arrest with lysed saddle embolus.
   # Hemodynamics s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely secondary
   to severe acidosis in setting of bilateral PE.  Currently the patient
   is not requiring any pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
   -          Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, as means to assess
   end-organ perfusion. Lactate and LFTs continue to trend down.
   -          Cont CVVH as means to decrease preload burden on RV
   -          Final repeat Echo read shows persistent RV strain with RV
   dilation with abnormal septal movement, hyperdynamic LV at EF 75% with
   a mild resting LVOT obstruction and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   # Mental status:  Patient has been off sedation for approximately 24
   hours now.  She is able to open eyes to command, however unable to
   follow other simple commands.  If she does not develop improvement in
   her mental status tomorrow, will get CT scan tomorrow.  Will check
   ammonia level today.
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis on heparin gtt. Pt
s PTT
   remains > 60.
   -          Continue heparin gtt goal PTT 60-80
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Pt is currently tolerated PSV.  Weaned off
   sedation, however patient continues to appear somnolent.  Will monitor
   respiratory status and o2 sats with reinstitution of AC ventilation as
   necessary.
   # ARF: ATN secondary to hypotensive event.  Crn much improved on CVVH,
   electrolytes within normal limits.
   -          Continue CVVH
   -          f/u renal recs
   # Shock Liver: Secondary to hypoperfusion, improving.
   -          No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   # Coagulopathy: INR stable. Likely [**3-7**] to shock liver. No current
   indications for Vitamin K.
   -          Continue to trend
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so
   will likely remain elevated.
   -          No current interventions needed
   .
   # + UA: Pt empirically started on Cipro, however urine cultures showed
   yeast only.  Will discontinue cipro at this time.  Will restart if
   develops symptoms.
   -      f/u cultures
   # Hypoglycvemia: Pt had hyperglycemia so [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 3630**] [**Male First Name (un) **] insulin gtt thwen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 71-year-old female who was admitted with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) after a bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. She had a cardiac arrest and was found to have a saddle embolus. She was treated with heparin and has been on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for 4 days. Her mental status has not changed significantly, and she is still intubated. Her vital signs are stable, but she has tachycardia and mild bibasilar crackles. Her laboratory results show improving liver function tests and decreasing lactate levels.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS):** The patient has acute respiratory failure, and if not managed properly, she may develop ARDS.
2. **Sepsis:** The patient has a history of sepsis and is at risk of developing further sepsis due to her compromised immune system.
3. **Coagulopathy:** The patient has a prolonged PTT, which may indicate a coagulopathy. This could lead to bleeding complications.
4. **Renal Failure:** The patient is on CRRT, and if her kidney function does not improve, she may require dialysis.
5. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and may be at risk of developing further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
6. **Mental Status Decline:** The patient's mental status has not improved, and if she does not develop improvement in the next 24 hours, a CT scan may be necessary to rule out other causes of her altered mental status.
7. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient has a history of bowel resection and may be at risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
8. **Pulmonary Embolism Recurrence:** The patient has had a saddle embolus, and if not properly treated, she may be at risk of developing further pulmonary emboli.

Overall, the patient is at risk of developing various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now 4 days s/p PEA arrest with lysed saddle embolus.
   .
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Pt is currently tolerated PSV.  Weaned off
   sedation, however patient continues to appear somnolent.  Will monitor
   respiratory status and o2 sats.  Currently on PSV at 5/5.
   - SBT, holding TFs
   - possible extubation if ABG is favorable
   .
    #Hemodynamics s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely secondary
   to severe acidosis in setting of bilateral PE.  Currently the patient
   is not requiring any pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
   - Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, as means to assess end-organ
   perfusion. Lactate and LFTs continue to trend down.
   - Cont CVVH as means to decrease preload burden on RV
   - Final repeat Echo read shows persistent RV strain with RV dilation
   with abnormal septal movement, hyperdynamic LV at EF 75% with a mild
   resting LVOT obstruction and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   .
   # Mental status:  Patient has been off sedation for approximately 24
   hours now.  She is able to open eyes to command, however unable to
   follow other simple commands.  If she does not develop improvement in
   her mental status tomorrow, will get CT scan tomorrow.  Will check
   ammonia level today.
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis on heparin gtt. Pt
s PTT
   remains > 60.
   - Continue heparin gtt goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # ARF: ATN secondary to hypotensive event.  Crn much improved on CVVH,
   electrolytes within normal limits.
   - Continue CVVH
   - f/u renal recs
 will find out when/if renal will transition to HD
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets trending down since admission.  On
   heparin with PE and on on PPI all of which can cause thrombocytopenia
   - PM CBC
   - will add Hep dep Abs if platelets trend down further
   .
   # Shock Liver/ Coagulopathy: Secondary to hypoperfusion, improving.
   - No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   .
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so
   will likely remain elevated.
   - No current interventions needed
   .
   # + UA: Pt empirically started on Cipro, however urine cultures showed
   yeast only.  Will discontinue cipro at this time.  Will restart if
   develops symptoms.  Resolved for now.
   .
   # Hypoglycvemia: Pt had hyperglycemia so started on insulin gtt
   transitioned to insulin sliding scale.
   - ISS, monitor FSBG

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female who was admitted with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) after a bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. She had a previous PEA arrest and was found to have severe acidosis, which likely contributed to the cardiac arrest. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, and blood pressure of 119/57 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100% on a FiO2 of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.3-13.4 K/μL
* Hemoglobin: 8.1-8.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 107-104 K/μL
* Creatinine: 1.5-1.7 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.1 g/dL
* LDH: 385 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 1.0 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She has a history of bilateral PE and had a previous PEA arrest.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing CVVH to manage her acute kidney injury and electrolyte imbalance
* Monitoring her respiratory status and oxygen saturation
* Weaning her off sedation and considering extubation if her ABG is favorable
* Trending her lactate, creatinine, and liver function tests to assess end-organ perfusion
* Continuing heparin therapy to prevent further thrombotic events
* Monitoring her platelet count and considering adding Hep dep Abs if it trends down further
* Monitoring her mental status and considering a CT scan if she does not show improvement

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to prolonged mechanical ventilation
* Acute kidney injury due to continued CVVH and potential for further electrolyte imbalance
* Thrombotic events due to continued heparin therapy
* Hemorrhagic complications due to prolonged anticoagulation
* Mental status changes due to continued sedation or potential for further electrolyte imbalance
* Infection due to prolonged hospitalization and potential for further immunosuppression"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-inch tall, 78.1 kg individual who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, tachycardia, acidosis, and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.1°C (98.7°F)
* Heart rate: 99-131 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 119/57 mmHg (75-134/113 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 14-27 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient is receiving various medications, including calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, and heparin sodium, as well as antibiotics. The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.3-13.4 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.1 g/dL
* Creatinine: 1.5-1.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 18-24 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.9-5.3 mEq/L
* Calcium: 7.1-7.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2-2.5 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 1.0-1.5 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their altered mental status, but they do not have any palpable peripheral pulses. The patient's respiratory support includes continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results also show elevated levels of troponin-T and CK-MB, indicating possible cardiac injury. The patient's alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin levels are elevated, suggesting possible liver dysfunction.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrest due to the patient's tachycardia and possible cardiac injury.
2. Respiratory failure due to the patient's acidosis and possible pulmonary embolism.
3. Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's altered mental status and possible infections.
4. Liver dysfunction or failure due to the patient's elevated liver enzymes.
5. Renal dysfunction or failure due to the patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels.
6. Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and hyperphosphatemia, due to the patient's acidosis and possible electrolyte disorders.
7. Pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis due to the patient's immobility and possible coagulopathy.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory and cardiac function to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now 4 days s/p PEA arrest with lysed saddle embolus.
   # Hemodynamics s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely secondary
   to severe acidosis in setting of bilateral PE.  Currently the patient
   is not requiring any pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
   -          Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, as means to assess
   end-organ perfusion. Lactate and LFTs continue to trend down.
   -          Cont CVVH as means to decrease preload burden on RV
   -          Final repeat Echo read shows persistent RV strain with RV
   dilation with abnormal septal movement, hyperdynamic LV at EF 75% with
   a mild resting LVOT obstruction and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   # Mental status:  Patient has been off sedation for approximately 24
   hours now.  She is able to open eyes to command, however unable to
   follow other simple commands.  If she does not develop improvement in
   her mental status tomorrow, will get CT scan tomorrow.  Will check
   ammonia level today.
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis on heparin gtt. Pt

   remains > 60.
   -          Continue heparin gtt goal PTT 60-80
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Pt is currently tolerated PSV.  Weaned off
   sedation, however patient continues to appear somnolent.  Will monitor
   respiratory status and o2 sats with reinstitution of AC ventilation as
   necessary.
   # ARF: ATN secondary to hypotensive event.  Crn much improved on CVVH,
   electrolytes within normal limits.
   -          Continue CVVH

   # Shock Liver: Secondary to hypoperfusion, improving.
   -          No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   # Coagulopathy: INR stable. Likely [**3-7**] to shock liver. No current
   indications for Vitamin K.
   -          Continue to trend
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so
   will likely remain elevated.
   -          No current interventions needed
   .
   # + UA: Pt empirically started on Cipro, however urine cultures showed
   yeast only.  Will discontinue cipro at this time.  Will restart if
   develops symptoms.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health status:

The patient is a 71-year-old female who was admitted with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and had a saddle embolus that lysed. She had a PEA arrest and was resuscitated. She is currently intubated and sedated, but has been off sedation for approximately 24 hours. She is able to open her eyes to command, but is unable to follow simple commands.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 99-131 bpm, and blood pressure of 119/57 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 14-27 inspirations per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100%. She is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and has been weaned off pressors.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 12.3-13.4 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 24.5-23.4%
* Plt: 107-87 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 1.8-1.5 mg/dL
* TCO2: 20-21 mmol/L
* Glucose: 65-159 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.6/60.1/1.3, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 758/12/0.78, ALT/AST: 939/141, Alk Phos/T Bili: 170/2.1, Differential-Neuts: 85.1%, Lymph: 10.1%, Mono: 4.2%, Eos: 0.3%, Lactic Acid: 1.2 mmol/L, Albumin: 3.1 g/dL, LDH: 385 IU/L, Ca++: 7.1 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL, PO4: 1.0 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Diabetes mellitus type 2
* Hypertension
* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
* Bilateral pulmonary embolism
* Shock liver
* Coagulopathy
* Troponin bump (likely secondary to demand ischemia)

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure
* Acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Sepsis
* Cardiac arrest
* Pulmonary embolism
* Chest pain
* Hypoglycemia

Based on the patient's condition, the following interventions are recommended:

* Continue CVVH to manage fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances
* Monitor lactate and Cr levels to assess end-organ perfusion
* Continue heparin gtt to prevent further thrombosis
* Monitor mental status and consider obtaining a CT scan if there is no improvement
* Continue insulin sliding scale to manage blood glucose levels
* Monitor for signs of sepsis and consider restarting antibiotics if symptoms develop
* Continue to trend LFTs and Lactate to assess liver function and perfusion
* Monitor for signs of cardiac ischemia and consider obtaining a stress test if symptoms develop."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 40 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a critically ill individual who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and pulmonary embolism (PE) following lytic therapy. They have undergone significant interventions, including intubation, mechanical ventilation, and cardiovascular support. The patient's hemodynamics have improved with the initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and their CVP is running at 14-18 mmHg off pressors.

The patient's respiratory status has also improved, with weaning to PSV 5/5 and hopes for extubation this morning. However, they continue to require mechanical ventilation.

The patient's acid-base status is abnormal, with a mixed metabolic acidosis. Their liver function tests (LFTs) have peaked and are trending down, and their platelet count is low, which may be related to consumptive coagulopathy, medications, or less likely, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

The patient's mental status has improved with the discontinuation of sedation, and they are waking up slowly. However, they have a low threshold for a head CT scan due to the lytic therapy and cardiac arrest to look for focal findings.

The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with persistent hypophosphatemia, which requires repletion with IV and oral phosphorus replacement.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Shock: The patient is at risk for shock due to their ongoing respiratory failure and cardiac instability.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of PE, and further emboli may occur, exacerbating their respiratory failure.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure may progress to ARDS, which could worsen their lung function and increase their risk of mortality.
4. Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, and they are at risk for further cardiac events due to their ongoing cardiac instability.
5. Sepsis: The patient's respiratory failure and cardiac instability may increase their risk of developing sepsis, which could further complicate their condition.
6. Multi-organ dysfunction: The patient's ongoing respiratory and cardiac failure may lead to multi-organ dysfunction, including kidney and liver failure.
7. Infection: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU increases their risk of developing hospital-acquired infections, which could further complicate their condition.

In summary, the patient is a critically ill individual who requires ongoing intensive care and close monitoring to manage their complex medical condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 40 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure following pulmonary embolism (PE) treatment with lytics. The patient's condition is complex, with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and significant end-organ injury to the liver and kidneys.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, and blood pressure of 122/58 mmHg. The patient is mechanically ventilated with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 665 mL and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on 40% FiO2.

The patient has undergone CVVH for acute kidney injury (AKI) and has improved hemodynamics with a CVP of 8-18 mmHg off pressors. The patient's acid-base status is acidic, with a pH of 7.38 and a bicarbonate level of 18 mmol/L.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of liver dysfunction, with elevated ALT and AST levels, and kidney dysfunction, with elevated creatinine and urea levels. The patient's platelet count is low, and the patient has evidence of consumptive coagulopathy.

The patient's mental status is altered, with the patient unable to follow commands and responding only to painful stimuli. The patient has a low threshold for head CT scans to rule out focal findings.

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

1. Nutrition: The patient is receiving Nutren Renal (Full) at a rate of 30 mL/hour.
2. Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels are being monitored, and insulin therapy is being used to maintain a target blood glucose level of 140-180 mg/dL.
3. Lines: The patient has an arterial line, dialysis catheter, and multi-lumen catheter in place.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving systemic heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and chlorhexidine for ventilator-associated pneumonia prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient is at risk for cardiac arrest due to the severity of their illness and the presence of cardiac dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to the severity of their lung injury and the need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to the presence of MODS and the need for prolonged ICU care.
4. Renal failure: The patient is at risk for renal failure due to the severity of their AKI and the need for CVVH.
5. Liver failure: The patient is at risk for liver failure due to the severity of their liver dysfunction and the need for prolonged ICU care.
6. Neurological complications: The patient is at risk for neurological complications due to the severity of their illness and the need for prolonged ICU care.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical condition, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent potential medical complications and improve their outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now 4 days s/p PEA arrest with lysed saddle embolus.
   .
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Intially on resp support -> weaned off
   sedation, more alert this AM.  On NC 4L
   - NGT
 speech and swallow today
   - monitor progress
   .
    #Hemodynamics s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely secondary
   to severe acidosis in setting of bilateral PE.  Currently the patient
   is not requiring any pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
   - Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, as means to assess end-organ
   perfusion. Lactate and LFTs continue to trend down.
   - Cont CVVH as means to decrease preload burden on RV
   - Final repeat Echo read shows persistent RV strain with RV dilation
   with abnormal septal movement, hyperdynamic LV at EF 75% with a mild
   resting LVOT obstruction and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   .
   # Mental status:  Patient has been off sedation for approximately 24
   hours now.  She is able to open eyes to command, however unable to
   follow other simple commands.  If she does not develop improvement in
   her mental status tomorrow, will get CT scan tomorrow.  Will check
   ammonia level today.
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis on heparin gtt. Pt
s PTT
   remains > 60.
   - Continue heparin gtt goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # ARF: ATN secondary to hypotensive event.  Crn much improved on CVVH,
   electrolytes within normal limits.
   - Continue CVVH
   - f/u renal recs
 transition to HD likely Monday [**2107-2-7**]
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets trending down since admission.  On
   heparin with PE and on on PPI all of which can cause thrombocytopenia.
   - likely HIT Type 1
   - cont to trend platelets
   - will add Hep dep Abs if platelets trend down further dramatically
   .
   # Shock Liver/ Coagulopathy: Secondary to hypoperfusion, improving.
   - No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   - AM LFTs/INR
   .
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so
   will likely remain elevated.
   - No current interventions needed
   .
   # + UA: Pt empirically started on Cipro, however urine cultures showed
   yeast only.  Will discontinue cipro at this time.  Will restart if
   develops symptoms.  Resolved.
   .
   # Hypoglycemia: Resolved.  Pt now with hyperglycemia started on insulin
   gtt
 transitioned to insulin sliding scale.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female who was admitted with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and underwent bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. She suffered a PEA arrest and was successfully resuscitated. She is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, and blood pressure of 142/69 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 99%.

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She is also at risk for thrombocytopenia due to heparin therapy and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, indicating end-organ hypoperfusion. Her creatinine levels are elevated, and she is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Her platelet count is trending down, and she is at risk for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

The patient's medical plan includes continued monitoring of her lactate, creatinine, and liver function tests (LFTs) to assess end-organ perfusion. She will continue to receive CVVH to decrease preload burden on her right ventricle. Her heparin gtt will be continued to maintain a PTT of 60-80 seconds.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she is at risk for further deterioration.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac status is compromised, and she is at risk for further cardiac events.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and elevated inflammatory markers indicate a high risk for sepsis.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is trending down, and she is at risk for further thrombocytopenia.
5. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and decreased albumin levels indicate potential hepatic dysfunction.
6. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and need for CRRT indicate potential renal failure.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated glucose levels and need for insulin therapy indicate potential hyperglycemia.
8. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of PE and ongoing anticoagulation therapy indicate a high risk for further pulmonary embolism.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal surgery and anticoagulation therapy indicate a high risk for gastrointestinal bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now 4 days s/p PEA arrest with lysed saddle embolus.
   .
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Pt is currently tolerated PSV.  Weaned off
   sedation, however patient continues to appear somnolent.  Will monitor
   respiratory status and o2 sats.  Currently on PSV at 5/5.
   - SBT, holding TFs
   - possible extubation if ABG is favorable
   .
    #Hemodynamics s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely secondary
   to severe acidosis in setting of bilateral PE.  Currently the patient
   is not requiring any pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
   - Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, as means to assess end-organ
   perfusion. Lactate and LFTs continue to trend down.
   - Cont CVVH as means to decrease preload burden on RV
   - Final repeat Echo read shows persistent RV strain with RV dilation
   with abnormal septal movement, hyperdynamic LV at EF 75% with a mild
   resting LVOT obstruction and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   .
   # Mental status:  Patient has been off sedation for approximately 24
   hours now.  She is able to open eyes to command, however unable to
   follow other simple commands.  If she does not develop improvement in
   her mental status tomorrow, will get CT scan tomorrow.  Will check
   ammonia level today.
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis on heparin gtt. Pt
s PTT
   remains > 60.
   - Continue heparin gtt goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # ARF: ATN secondary to hypotensive event.  Crn much improved on CVVH,
   electrolytes within normal limits.
   - Continue CVVH
   - f/u renal recs
 will find out when/if renal will transition to HD
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets trending down since admission.  On
   heparin with PE and on on PPI all of which can cause thrombocytopenia
   - PM CBC
   - will add Hep dep Abs if platelets trend down further
   .
   # Shock Liver/ Coagulopathy: Secondary to hypoperfusion, improving.
   - No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   .
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so
   will likely remain elevated.
   - No current interventions needed
   .
   # + UA: Pt empirically started on Cipro, however urine cultures showed
   yeast only.  Will discontinue cipro at this time.  Will restart if
   develops symptoms.  Resolved for now.
   .
   # Hypoglycvemia: Pt had hyperglycemia so started on insulin gtt
   transitioned to insulin sliding scale.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now 4 days s/p PEA arrest with lysed saddle embolus.
   .
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Pt is currently tolerated PSV.  Weaned off
   sedation, however patient continues to appear somnolent.  Will monitor
   respiratory status and o2 sats.  Currently on PSV at 5/5.
   - SBT, holding TFs
   - possible extubation if ABG is favorable
   .
    #Hemodynamics s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely secondary
   to severe acidosis in setting of bilateral PE.  Currently the patient
   is not requiring any pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
   - Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, as means to assess end-organ
   perfusion. Lactate and LFTs continue to trend down.
   - Cont CVVH as means to decrease preload burden on RV
   - Final repeat Echo read shows persistent RV strain with RV dilation
   with abnormal septal movement, hyperdynamic LV at EF 75% with a mild
   resting LVOT obstruction and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   .
   # Mental status:  Patient has been off sedation for approximately 24
   hours now.  She is able to open eyes to command, however unable to
   follow other simple commands.  If she does not develop improvement in
   her mental status tomorrow, will get CT scan tomorrow.  Will check
   ammonia level today.
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis on heparin gtt. Pt
s PTT
   remains > 60.
   - Continue heparin gtt goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # ARF: ATN secondary to hypotensive event.  Crn much improved on CVVH,
   electrolytes within normal limits.
   - Continue CVVH
   - f/u renal recs
 will find out when/if renal will transition to HD
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets trending down since admission.  On
   heparin with PE and on on PPI all of which can cause thrombocytopenia
   - PM CBC
   - will add Hep dep Abs if platelets trend down further
   .
   # Shock Liver/ Coagulopathy: Secondary to hypoperfusion, improving.
   - No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   .
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so
   will likely remain elevated.
   - No current interventions needed
   .
   # + UA: Pt empirically started on Cipro, however urine cultures showed
   yeast only.  Will discontinue cipro at this time.  Will restart if
   develops symptoms.  Resolved for now.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was admitted with bilateral pulmonary emboli (PE) and underwent bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. She experienced a perioperative cardiac arrest, which was likely secondary to severe acidosis and bilateral PE.

Current medical issues:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and pressure support ventilation (PSV) at 5 cmH2O. She is weaned off sedation, but her mental status remains somnolent. The plan is to monitor her respiratory status and oxygen saturation, and consider extubation if her arterial blood gas (ABG) results are favorable.
2. Hemodynamics: The patient is not requiring any pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure. Her lactate and liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, indicating improvement in end-organ perfusion.
3. Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: The patient has undergone lysis with heparin, and her partial thromboplastin time (PTT) remains above 60 seconds.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has developed AKI secondary to hypotensive events. Her creatinine levels are improving with continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH).
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is trending down, likely secondary to heparin, PE, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use.
6. Shock Liver/Coagulopathy: The patient has developed liver dysfunction and coagulopathy secondary to hypoperfusion. Her liver function tests are improving.
7. Troponin Bump: The patient's troponin levels are likely elevated secondary to demand ischemia and increased right ventricular (RV) strain.
8. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient had empirically started on ciprofloxacin, but urine cultures showed only yeast growth. The antibiotic was discontinued, and the patient will be restarted if symptoms develop.
9. Hypoglycemia: The patient had hyperglycemia, so insulin was started, and the patient was transitioned to an insulin sliding scale.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if she is not extubated or if her underlying lung disease worsens.
2. Hemorrhage: The patient's thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly with invasive procedures or trauma.
3. Sepsis: The patient's immunosuppressed state and UTI may increase the risk of sepsis.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's troponin bump and RV strain may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Renal failure: The patient's AKI may progress to chronic kidney disease or require hemodialysis.
6. Liver failure: The patient's liver dysfunction may worsen, leading to hepatic encephalopathy or coagulopathy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, including oxygen saturation and ABG results.
2. Continue CVVH to manage AKI and electrolyte imbalance.
3. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider platelet transfusions if necessary.
4. Continue heparin therapy to manage saddle PE and prevent further thrombosis.
5. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and consider liver function testing if liver dysfunction worsens.
6. Continue insulin therapy to manage hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.
7. Consider restarting antibiotics if symptoms of UTI develop.
8. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider a computed tomography (CT) scan if there is no improvement.
9. Consider consultation with a cardiologist or pulmonologist to optimize management of the patient's cardiac and respiratory status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-inch tall individual weighing 79.6 kg, admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism, and chest pain.

The patient was previously on invasive ventilation, which was stopped at 3:53 PM. They are currently receiving oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula, and their ventilator mode is set to CPAP/PSV. Their vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 142/69 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 19 inspirations per minute.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 12.6, hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 87. Their electrolyte levels are within normal range, with a potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L, calcium level of 7.1 mg/dL, and magnesium level of 2.1 mg/dL.

The patient's medications include heparin sodium, potassium chloride, calcium gluconate, fentanyl, and other ICU medications. They are receiving infusions of heparin, potassium chloride, and calcium gluconate through CRRT.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their altered mental status, and therefore, the following assessments were not performed: peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and cardiac examination.

The patient's diagnosis includes altered mental status, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism, and chest pain. The patient's plan includes continued monitoring and management of their vital signs, laboratory results, and medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Worsening of respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 19 inspirations per minute, and their PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 3475, indicating a high risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia and cardiac arrest indicate a high risk of cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to cardiac arrest or stroke.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's diagnosis of pulmonary embolism increases their risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary hypertension.
4. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory failure increase their risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory failure, and kidney damage.
6. Kidney damage: The patient's use of CRRT and their diagnosis of metabolic acidosis increase their risk of kidney damage and acute kidney injury.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medications to prevent these potential complications and ensure their optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now 4 days s/p PEA arrest with lysed saddle embolus.
   .
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Pt is currently tolerated PSV.  Weaned off
   sedation, however patient continues to appear somnolent.  Will monitor
   respiratory status and o2 sats.  Currently on PSV at 5/5.
   - SBT, holding TFs
   - possible extubation if ABG is favorable
   .
    #Hemodynamics s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely secondary
   to severe acidosis in setting of bilateral PE.  Currently the patient
   is not requiring any pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
   - Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, as means to assess end-organ
   perfusion. Lactate and LFTs continue to trend down.
   - Cont CVVH as means to decrease preload burden on RV
   - Final repeat Echo read shows persistent RV strain with RV dilation
   with abnormal septal movement, hyperdynamic LV at EF 75% with a mild
   resting LVOT obstruction and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   .
   # Mental status:  Patient has been off sedation for approximately 24
   hours now.  She is able to open eyes to command, however unable to
   follow other simple commands.  If she does not develop improvement in
   her mental status tomorrow, will get CT scan tomorrow.  Will check
   ammonia level today.
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis on heparin gtt. Pt
s PTT
   remains > 60.
   - Continue heparin gtt goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # ARF: ATN secondary to hypotensive event.  Crn much improved on CVVH,
   electrolytes within normal limits.
   - Continue CVVH
   - f/u renal recs
 will find out when/if renal will transition to HD
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets trending down since admission.  On
   heparin with PE and on on PPI all of which can cause thrombocytopenia
   - PM CBC
   - will add Hep dep Abs if platelets trend down further
   .
   # Shock Liver/ Coagulopathy: Secondary to hypoperfusion, improving.
   - No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   .
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so
   will likely remain elevated.
   - No current interventions needed
   .
   # + UA: Pt empirically started on Cipro, however urine cultures showed
   yeast only.  Will discontinue cipro at this time.  Will restart if
   develops symptoms.  Resolved for now.
   .
   # Hypoglycvemia: Pt had hyperglycemia so started on insulin gtt
   transitioned to insulin sliding scale.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now 4 days s/p PEA arrest with lysed saddle embolus.
   .
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Pt is currently tolerated PSV.  Weaned off
   sedation, however patient continues to appear somnolent.  Will monitor
   respiratory status and o2 sats.  Currently on PSV at 5/5.
   - SBT, holding TFs
   - possible extubation if ABG is favorable
   .
    #Hemodynamics s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely secondary
   to severe acidosis in setting of bilateral PE.  Currently the patient
   is not requiring any pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
   - Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, as means to assess end-organ
   perfusion. Lactate and LFTs continue to trend down.
   - Cont CVVH as means to decrease preload burden on RV
   - Final repeat Echo read shows persistent RV strain with RV dilation
   with abnormal septal movement, hyperdynamic LV at EF 75% with a mild
   resting LVOT obstruction and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   .
   # Mental status:  Patient has been off sedation for approximately 24
   hours now.  She is able to open eyes to command, however unable to
   follow other simple commands.  If she does not develop improvement in
   her mental status tomorrow, will get CT scan tomorrow.  Will check
   ammonia level today.
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis on heparin gtt. Pt
s PTT
   remains > 60.
   - Continue heparin gtt goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # ARF: ATN secondary to hypotensive event.  Crn much improved on CVVH,
   electrolytes within normal limits.
   - Continue CVVH
   - f/u renal recs
 will find out when/if renal will transition to HD
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets trending down since admission.  On
   heparin with PE and on on PPI all of which can cause thrombocytopenia
   - PM CBC
   - will add Hep dep Abs if platelets trend down further
   .
   # Shock Liver/ Coagulopathy: Secondary to hypoperfusion, improving.
   - No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   .
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so
   will likely remain elevated.
   - No current interventions needed
   .
   # + UA: Pt empirically started on Cipro, however urine cultures showed
   yeast only.  Will discontinue cipro at this time.  Will restart if
   develops symptoms.  Resolved for now.
   .
   # Hypoglycvemia: Pt had hyperglycemia so started on insulin gtt
   transitioned to insulin sliding scale.

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was admitted with bilateral pulmonary emboli and underwent a bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. She suffered a perioperative cardiac arrest and was resuscitated.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. She is sedated but arousable and able to open her eyes to command. She has a history of tachycardia, hypertension, and acidosis. Her respiratory status is stable, but she is at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying conditions.

The patient's hemodynamic status is also concerning, with evidence of cardiogenic shock and acute kidney injury. She is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and has been weaned off vasopressors.

The patient's mental status is altered, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 12, indicating a decreased level of consciousness. She is unable to follow simple commands and has a history of delirium.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 18 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but her platelet count is low, at 87,000/mm³.

The patient's radiology results show evidence of bilateral pulmonary emboli, with a saddle embolus in the right pulmonary artery.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying conditions and her current intubation status.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has evidence of cardiogenic shock, with a decreased cardiac output and a decreased blood pressure.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient has acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL and a BUN level of 18 mg/dL.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, at 87,000/mm³, which may be due to her heparin therapy and her underlying conditions.
5. Altered mental status: The patient has an altered mental status, with a decreased level of consciousness and a history of delirium.
6. Saddle pulmonary embolism: The patient has a saddle pulmonary embolism, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Invasive ventilation: The patient will continue to receive invasive ventilation to support her respiratory status.
2. CRRT: The patient will continue to receive CRRT to manage her acute kidney injury.
3. Heparin therapy: The patient will continue to receive heparin therapy to prevent further thrombotic events.
4. Platelet transfusions: The patient may require platelet transfusions to manage her thrombocytopenia.
5. Neurological monitoring: The patient's neurological status will be closely monitored to detect any changes in her mental status.
6. Cardiovascular monitoring: The patient's cardiovascular status will be closely monitored to detect any changes in her hemodynamic status.
7. Laboratory monitoring: The patient's laboratory results will be closely monitored to detect any changes in her kidney function, electrolyte levels, and platelet count.
8. Radiology monitoring: The patient's radiology results will be closely monitored to detect any changes in her pulmonary embolism.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for further complications and requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) and shock. She was successfully extubated and is currently receiving invasive ventilation. Her hemodynamics have improved with the initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). She is receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin and is being monitored for thrombocytopenia. Her mental status is altered, but she is waking up slowly after stopping sedation. She has a history of acidosis, metabolic respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving invasive ventilation, which may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, which may increase the risk of future cardiac arrest.
5. Liver and kidney damage: The patient has significant end-organ injury to her liver and kidneys, which may increase the risk of long-term damage.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to her prolonged stay in the ICU and her immunocompromised state.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk of developing gastrointestinal complications such as stress ulcer and bleeding due to her critical illness.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may be due to her critical illness, and she may be at risk of developing neurological complications such as seizures or stroke.
9. Thrombosis: The patient is at risk of developing thrombosis due to her anticoagulation therapy and her immobility.
10. Malnutrition: The patient is at risk of developing malnutrition due to her prolonged stay in the ICU and her inability to eat."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-inch tall, 79.6 kg male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pulmonary embolism (PE) and resolving shock. The patient has been extubated and is receiving invasive ventilation. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 148/66 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He has a sinus tachycardia rhythm and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 5 mmHg. The patient's fluid balance is positive, with a total input of 2,970 mL and a total output of 4,286 mL. He has received calcium gluconate, heparin sodium, and potassium chloride infusions, as well as fentanyl for pain management.

The patient has undergone several laboratory tests, including complete blood counts, electrolyte panels, and liver function tests. His white blood cell count is 12.0 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin is 8.0 g/dL, and platelet count is 79 x 10^9/L. His liver function tests are mildly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 141 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 939 IU/L.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Altered mental status (not delirium)
* Tachycardia
* Acidosis, metabolic
* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
* Cardiac arrest
* Pulmonary embolism (PE), acute
* Chest pain

The patient's plan includes:

* Weaning from invasive ventilation
* Switching from continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) to hemodialysis
* Repleting phosphorus levels
* Monitoring and managing his respiratory, cardiac, and liver function

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or require mechanical ventilation.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest may recur, and he may require cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient's pulmonary embolism may recur or migrate to other parts of the lung, leading to further respiratory compromise.
* Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen if his respiratory failure or cardiac arrest recurs.
* Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, and his liver failure may worsen if he develops sepsis or other complications.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen if he develops disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or other bleeding complications.
* Hypophosphatemia: The patient's hypophosphatemia may worsen if he develops respiratory failure or cardiac arrest, leading to further electrolyte imbalances."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) and resolving shock. He was successfully extubated and is currently on invasive ventilation. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 148/66 mmHg. He is receiving calcium gluconate, heparin sodium, and potassium chloride infusions, as well as fentanyl for pain management.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis, and transaminitis. His platelet count is low, and his coagulation parameters are abnormal. He is also experiencing respiratory failure, which has resolved, and is being weaned off oxygen therapy.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's altered mental status is attributed to the underlying condition and is not delirium. He is at risk for cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism, and respiratory failure. He is being managed with anticoagulation therapy, invasive ventilation, and dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's history of pulmonary embolism and shock increases his risk for cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure has resolved, but he is still at risk for recurrence.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury is severe, and he requires ongoing dialysis therapy.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is severe and requires ongoing management.
5. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis is resolving, but he is at risk for liver dysfunction.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely due to consumptive coagulopathy, and he requires ongoing monitoring.
7. Hypophosphatemia: The patient's hypophosphatemia is severe and requires ongoing repletion.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his underlying condition and invasive therapies.
9. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy increase his risk for bleeding.
10. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of pulmonary embolism and shock increases his risk for gastrointestinal bleeding."

   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now 4 days s/p PEA arrest with lysed saddle embolus.
   .
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Intially on resp support -> weaned off
   sedation, more alert this AM.  On NC 4L
   - NGT
 speech and swallow today
   - monitor progress
   .
    #Hemodynamics s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely secondary
   to severe acidosis in setting of bilateral PE.  Currently the patient
   is not requiring any pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
   - Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, as means to assess end-organ
   perfusion. Lactate and LFTs continue to trend down.
   - Cont CVVH as means to decrease preload burden on RV
   - Final repeat Echo read shows persistent RV strain with RV dilation
   with abnormal septal movement, hyperdynamic LV at EF 75% with a mild
   resting LVOT obstruction and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   .
   # Mental status:  Patient has been off sedation for approximately 24
   hours now.  She is able to open eyes to command, however unable to
   follow other simple commands.  If she does not develop improvement in
   her mental status tomorrow, will get CT scan tomorrow.  Will check
   ammonia level today.
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis on heparin gtt. Pt
s PTT
   remains > 60.
   - Continue heparin gtt goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # ARF: ATN secondary to hypotensive event.  Crn much improved on CVVH,
   electrolytes within normal limits.
   - Continue CVVH
   - f/u renal recs
 transition to HD likely Monday [**2107-2-7**]
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets trending down since admission.  On
   heparin with PE and on on PPI all of which can cause thrombocytopenia.
   - likely HIT Type 1
   - cont to trend platelets
   - will add Hep dep Abs if platelets trend down further dramatically
   .
   # Shock Liver/ Coagulopathy: Secondary to hypoperfusion, improving.
   - No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   - AM LFTs/INR
   .
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so
   will likely remain elevated.
   - No current interventions needed
   .
   # + UA: Pt empirically started on Cipro, however urine cultures showed
   yeast only.  Will discontinue cipro at this time.  Will restart if
   develops symptoms.  Resolved.
   .
   # Hypoglycemia: Resolved.  Pt now with hyperglycemia started on insulin
   gtt
 transitioned to insulin sliding scale.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now 4 days s/p PEA arrest with lysed saddle embolus.
   .
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Intially on resp support -> weaned off
   sedation, more alert this AM.  On NC 4L
   - NGT
 speech and swallow today
   - monitor progress
   .
    #Hemodynamics s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely secondary
   to severe acidosis in setting of bilateral PE.  Currently the patient
   is not requiring any pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
   - Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, as means to assess end-organ
   perfusion. Lactate and LFTs continue to trend down.
   - Cont CVVH as means to decrease preload burden on RV
   - Final repeat Echo read shows persistent RV strain with RV dilation
   with abnormal septal movement, hyperdynamic LV at EF 75% with a mild
   resting LVOT obstruction and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   .
   # Mental status:  Patient has been off sedation for approximately 24
   hours now.  She is able to open eyes to command, however unable to
   follow other simple commands.  If she does not develop improvement in
   her mental status tomorrow, will get CT scan tomorrow.  Will check
   ammonia level today.
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis on heparin gtt. Pt
s PTT
   remains > 60.
   - Continue heparin gtt goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # ARF: ATN secondary to hypotensive event.  Crn much improved on CVVH,
   electrolytes within normal limits.
   - Continue CVVH
   - f/u renal recs
 transition to HD likely Monday [**2107-2-7**]
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets trending down since admission.  On
   heparin with PE and on on PPI all of which can cause thrombocytopenia.
   - likely HIT Type 1
   - cont to trend platelets
   - will add Hep dep Abs if platelets trend down further dramatically
   .
   # Shock Liver/ Coagulopathy: Secondary to hypoperfusion, improving.
   - No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   - AM LFTs/INR
   .
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so
   will likely remain elevated.
   - No current interventions needed
   .
   # + UA: Pt empirically started on Cipro, however urine cultures showed
   yeast only.  Will discontinue cipro at this time.  Will restart if
   develops symptoms.  Resolved.

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female admitted to the ICU with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and subsequent cardiac arrest. She has undergone bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.5°C (97.7°F)
* Heart rate: 83 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 108/70 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Central venous pressure (CVP): 9 mmHg

The patient is receiving continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and has been weaned off sedation. She is able to open her eyes to command but is unable to follow simple commands. Her mental status is being monitored, and a computed tomography (CT) scan may be ordered if there is no improvement tomorrow.

The patient has a saddle pulmonary embolism that has been lysed with heparin, and her PTT remains above 60. She is being continued on heparin to maintain a PTT of 60-80.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 12.3 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit (Hct): 24.2%
* Platelet count: 83 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.3 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.1 g/dL
* Calcium: 7.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.0 mg/dL

The patient has acute respiratory failure, hemodynamics secondary to PEA arrest, mental status changes, saddle pulmonary embolism, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), thrombocytopenia, shock liver/coagulopathy, and troponin bump.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen therapy, and her oxygen saturation is 100%. However, her respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, which may indicate underlying respiratory distress.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a saddle pulmonary embolism, and her cardiac enzymes are elevated. She may be at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
3. Renal complications: The patient has ATN and is receiving CVVH. She may be at risk for further renal damage or dialysis-dependent renal failure.
4. Neurological complications: The patient has mental status changes and may be at risk for further neurological deterioration, such as seizures or coma.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving heparin, and her platelet count is trending down. She may be at risk for bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial bleeding.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of urinary tract infection and is receiving antibiotics. She may be at risk for further infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
7. Metabolic complications: The patient has hyperglycemia and is receiving insulin therapy. She may be at risk for further metabolic complications, such as hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiac, renal, neurological, and metabolic status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now 4 days s/p PEA arrest with lysed saddle embolus.
   # Mental status:  Patient has been off sedation for approximately 48
   hours now, her mental status is clear.
   - Bedside swallow evaluation
   - D/C NGT if successful
   # ARF: ATN secondary to hypotensive event.  Crn much improved on CVVH,
   electrolytes within normal limits.
   - f/u renal recs
 transition to HD likely today or Monday [**2107-2-7**]
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Paroxysm likely due to fluid contraction due to
   aggressive CVVH.  Controlled with Lopressor 5mg IV x1
   - F/U TSH
   - No need for repeat echo at this time
   - Switch to HD as per ARF plan
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Resolved.
   - Continue O2 NC prn
   - monitor progress
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis on heparin gtt. Pt
s PTT
   remains > 60.
   - Continue heparin gtt goal PTT 60-80
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets trending down since admission.  On
   heparin with PE and on on PPI all of which can cause thrombocytopenia.
   - likely HIT Type 1
   - cont to trend platelets
   - will add Hep dep Abs if platelets trend down further dramatically
   # Shock Liver/ Coagulopathy: Secondary to hypoperfusion, improving.
   - No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   - AM LFTs/INR
   # Hypoglycemia: Resolved.  Pt now with hyperglycemia started on insulin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, saddle pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. She has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was admitted 4 days ago with bilateral pulmonary emboli and underwent a bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. She has been on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) for acute renal failure and has had a paroxysm of atrial fibrillation, which has been controlled with Lopressor. She has also had hypoglycemia, which has resolved, and is now on insulin therapy. She is currently awake and alert, complaining of discomfort from her nasogastric (NG) tube and back pain.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's paroxysm of atrial fibrillation may be related to fluid contraction due to aggressive CVVH. Further monitoring and management of electrolytes and fluid status are necessary to prevent future episodes.
2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has improved, but continued monitoring is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
3. Saddle pulmonary emboli: The patient's PTT remains elevated, indicating ongoing coagulation activity. Further anticoagulation therapy may be necessary to prevent further thrombus formation.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is trending down, which may be related to heparin therapy, PPI, or HIT Type 1. Further monitoring and management of platelet count is necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
5. Shock liver/coagulopathy: The patient's liver function tests and coagulation studies are improving, but continued monitoring is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia has been managed with insulin therapy, but continued monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary to prevent further fluctuations.
7. NG tube discomfort: The patient's discomfort from the NG tube may be related to the tube itself or the fluid and electrolyte imbalance. Further assessment and management of the NG tube are necessary to prevent further discomfort and complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue CVVH and monitor electrolyte and fluid status closely to prevent further atrial fibrillation episodes.
2. Monitor respiratory status closely and consider further respiratory support if necessary.
3. Continue anticoagulation therapy and monitor PTT to prevent further thrombus formation.
4. Monitor platelet count closely and consider adding Hep dep Abs if platelets trend down further.
5. Continue to monitor liver function tests and coagulation studies to prevent further deterioration.
6. Monitor blood glucose levels closely and adjust insulin therapy as necessary to prevent further fluctuations.
7. Consider removing the NG tube if the patient's discomfort persists and assess the need for further respiratory support."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current health status as follows:

The patient is a 66.5 kg, 62-inch tall individual who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of PEA arrest, PE, and ARF. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, and blood pressure of 128/71 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 100% on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* Hemoglobin: 8.2 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 12.3
* Platelet count: 83
* Creatinine: 1.3
* Glucose: 173
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.1 g/dL
* LDH: 385 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.0 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Tachycardia
* Altered mental status (not delirium)
* Respiratory failure (acute, not ARDS)
* Cardiac arrest
* Pulmonary embolism (PE), acute
* Chest pain

The patient's plan of care includes:

* ICU care
* Nutrition: Nutren Renal (Full) at 30 mL/hour
* Glycemic control
* Lines: dialysis catheter and multi-lumen
* Prophylaxis: DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* Code status: full code
* Disposition: ICU

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: progression to ARDS, respiratory acidosis, or respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation
* Cardiac arrest: recurrence of PEA arrest or development of other cardiac arrhythmias
* Pulmonary embolism: progression to saddle embolism, pulmonary hypertension, or right ventricular dysfunction
* Metabolic acidosis: progression to severe acidosis, lactic acidosis, or ketoacidosis
* Chest pain: progression to cardiac tamponade, pericarditis, or myocardial infarction
* Altered mental status: progression to coma, brain death, or persistent altered mental status
* Nutritional deficiencies: malnutrition, electrolyte imbalance, or vitamin deficiencies
* Infection: development of sepsis, septic shock, or organ failure

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan of care accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
