   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady with dementia presents from [**Location (un) 1075**] [**Hospital1 1657**] Nursing
   home with cholangitis & sepsis.  She is improved this morning after
   aggressive fluid hydration and antibiotics.
   #. Cholangitis + Sepsis: The patient looks improved this morning with
   resolving hypotension and tachycardia, decreased white count and
   increased urine output. Her lactate and Cr are improving, anion gap
   decreasing and her metabolic alkalosis appears to have resolved.  She
   is NPO with INR of 1.5 pending ERCP today.
   - Continue Cipro and Flagyl IV renally dosed
   - NPO with IVF titrated to UOP>= 30mL/hr until signs of fluid overload
   on exam
   - PM Hct & Lytes
   - Symptomatic control with Zofran
   - Trending fever curve, white count
   - Hold home antihypertensives
   #. Oliguric renal failure: UOP improving with fluid administration and
   Cr at 1.9 (baseline still unknown).
   - Treat underlying sepsis as above
   - Aggressive volume hydration to goal UOP >= 30mL/hr
   - Renally dose medications/Avoid nephrotoxins
   #. UGIB/Tear: According to recent lavage the patient is not actively
   bleeding, likely has a small tear from vomiting.  Hematocrit has
   decreased signficantly as expected with aggressive hydration
   - Convert home Omeprazole to Protonix 40mg IV Q12
   - Repeat Hct Q12 while stable, expecting a drop overnight after fluid
   hydration
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&Screen
   - Telemetry
   #. Dementia: Patient reportedly at baseline but will confirm with
   family in AM.  Depression component, holding Celexa & Clonazepam while
   NPO.  Delerium seems to have improved.
   #. HTN: Patient currently hypotensive, holding home anti-hypertensives
   (Labetalol, Captopril, Amlodipine)
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO every other
   day to start [**2116-6-25**]
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.  Consider
   Morphine IV PRN when hemodynamically stable.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Holding Statin while NPO
   #. Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl as 50mcg IV daily, will return to
   100mcg PO daily once taking POs
   #. CAD: Holding ASA, Statin
   #. FEN - NPO, Fluids as above, replete lytes

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   84 yo F from NH w/ PMH if vascular dementia, recently treated for
   urosepsis admitted with cholangitis.
   Presented after 2 days n/v/abd pain.
   In ed febrile 102, tachy to 114 and transiently hypotensive to 90's
   systolic with fluid response.  94% on 2 L.  LFTs c/w obstructive

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of vascular dementia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, tia/cva, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She was admitted to the ICU with cholangitis and sepsis, and is currently being treated with aggressive fluid hydration, antibiotics, and other supportive measures.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 101 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 100/74 mmHg. Her respiratory status is also stable, with an oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, with a white blood cell count of 12.5 K/μL, a hematocrit of 33.4%, and a platelet count of 119 K/μL. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, with elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Her renal function is also impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 40 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies, including a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen, show evidence of intrahepatic biliary dilatation and a possible obstructive picture.

The patient's primary issues include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to her cholangitis and sepsis.
2. Cholangitis: The patient has cholangitis, which is a bacterial infection of the bile ducts.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has ARF, which is likely due to sepsis and dehydration.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, which is a bleeding disorder caused by her liver disease and sepsis.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which is a complication of sepsis and liver disease.
6. Anemia: The patient has a low red blood cell count, which is a complication of sepsis and liver disease.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which is a sign of sepsis.
8. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a metabolic acidosis, which is a complication of sepsis and liver disease.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Aggressive fluid hydration: The patient will continue to receive aggressive fluid hydration to treat her sepsis and ARF.
2. Antibiotic coverage: The patient will continue to receive antibiotic coverage for her GI tract with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.
3. Renal dosing: The patient's medications will be renally dosed to avoid nephrotoxicity.
4. Monitoring: The patient will be closely monitored for signs of sepsis, ARF, and coagulopathy.
5. Imaging studies: The patient will undergo further imaging studies to evaluate the extent of her cholangitis and ARF.
6. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): The patient will undergo ERCP to evaluate the extent of her cholangitis and to perform a sphincterotomy if necessary.

The patient's prognosis is guarded due to her underlying medical conditions and the severity of her illness. She will require close monitoring and aggressive treatment to manage her sepsis and ARF."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with ongoing management of various medical conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 101 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 100/74 mmHg. Respiratory support is provided through nasal cannula oxygen delivery, with a SpO2 of 94%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), abnormal renal function (Cr 1.9 mg/dL), and hyperglycemia (Glucose 67 mg/dL). The complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 12.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 119 K/uL.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the inability to assess peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems. Imaging studies, including a chest X-ray, are limited by positioning and unclear diaphragm.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis and septic shock due to the patient's high white blood cell count and elevated liver enzymes.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to the patient's elevated creatinine levels and potential nephrotoxic medications.
3. Hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) due to the patient's elevated glucose levels.
4. Coagulopathy and bleeding complications due to the patient's prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and international normalized ratio (INR).
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other respiratory complications due to the patient's prolonged respiratory support.
6. Stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's prolonged hospitalization and use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's immobility and lack of systemic anticoagulation.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, indicating that they do not wish to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if their heart stops or they experience cardiac arrest. The patient is planned for transfer to the floor once their condition stabilizes."

   An 84 year old lady with dementia presents from [**Location (un) 1075**] [**Hospital1 1657**] Nursing
   home recent nausea and vomiting with a concern for cholangitis based on
   fever, white count and RUQ pain.  On arrival to the floor she appears
   profoundly dry despite aggressive fluid hydration in the ED.
   .
   #. Cholangitis + Sepsis: Given the patient's Fever, WBC count, RUQ
   pain, LFT abnormalities, Imaging her primary process is cholangitis
   stemming from possible gallstones or ? clots based on CT.  Her fever
   curve is trending down with initial antibiotics (Vanc/Levo/Flagyl) and
   her pain is improving.  Recent urosepsis hospital admission with change
   in diet likely contributed to biliary sludging predisposing her to
   cholangitis.  She has [**5-17**] of the [**Last Name (un) 6321**] pentad (unable to assess
   mental status changes without appreciating her baseline).  The
   patient's elevated lactate is attributable to sepsis, and she is
   demonstrating a mixed metabolic acidosis (lactic acidosis) and
   alkalosis from volume contraction.
   - Change Antibiotic coverage to Cipro and Flagyl IV renally dose
   - NPO with aggressive NS boluses and oral care

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old woman with dementia, admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of cholangitis, sepsis, and oliguric renal failure. She has a history of recent nausea and vomiting, fever, white count elevation, and RUQ pain. Imaging studies suggest possible gallstones or clots as the cause of cholangitis. She is receiving IV antibiotics and fluids, and an ERCP is scheduled for early morning.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cholangitis: The patient's primary process is cholangitis, which can lead to septic shock, multi-organ failure, and mortality if not managed promptly and effectively.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate and mixed metabolic acidosis indicate ongoing sepsis, which can worsen her condition and increase the risk of organ dysfunction.
3. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient's current UOP is 125, and her Cr is elevated. Aggressive volume hydration is necessary to prevent further deterioration of her renal function.
4. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding/Tear: The patient is at risk for ongoing bleeding or a tear in the esophagus, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and respiratory compromise.
5. Dementia: The patient's dementia may worsen due to the underlying infection and metabolic derangements, leading to increased risk of falls, aspiration, and other complications.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen due to ongoing sepsis, oliguric renal failure, and dehydration, which can lead to organ dysfunction and mortality.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance, particularly hypokalemia, may worsen due to ongoing diuresis, vomiting, and diarrhea, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
8. Infection: The patient's infection may progress, leading to worsening sepsis, organ dysfunction, and mortality.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who underwent ERCP with stent placement and was returned intubated due to concerns about debris in the airway. They are currently on invasive ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a set tidal volume of 400 mL and a spontaneous tidal volume of 360 mL.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 125/57 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 20 inspirations per minute. Their oxygen saturation is 98%, and they are receiving 35% oxygen through the endotracheal tube.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, with a peak of 14.5 K/uL. Their platelet count is within normal limits, and their liver function tests are slightly elevated. Their renal function tests are also slightly elevated, with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL.

The patient has a diagnosis of cholangitis, and they are receiving antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and piperacillin-tazobactam. They are also receiving prophylactic medications for stress ulcer, deep vein thrombosis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction due to cholangitis and bacterial sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure and ventilator-associated lung injury due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation due to stress ulcer prophylaxis and cholangitis.
4. Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism due to immobility and lack of prophylactic anticoagulation.
5. Worsening of liver function and development of liver failure due to cholangitis and sepsis.
6. Renal failure and acute kidney injury due to sepsis, dehydration, and nephrotoxic medications.
7. Development of ventilator-associated pneumonia and respiratory failure due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old lady who was admitted to the ICU with cholangitis following an ERCP procedure. She has a history of dementia, depression, hypertension, gout, spinal stenosis, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and CAD. She underwent ERCP with stent placement and was intubated due to concern for ""debris"" in her airway. She has been on invasive ventilation since admission and has required adjustments to her ventilator settings. She has also been receiving antibiotics and other medications to manage her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she is at risk of developing respiratory failure due to her underlying lung disease and the need for invasive ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a bacteremia and is at risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and she has oliguric renal failure, which could progress to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and the ERCP procedure may have caused bleeding or perforation, which could lead to further bleeding or sepsis.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of CAD and hypertension, and the stress of the ERCP procedure and her underlying medical conditions could lead to cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of cholangitis, and the ERCP procedure may have introduced bacteria into her bile ducts, which could lead to infection and sepsis.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is NPO, and she may be at risk of developing nutritional deficiencies, particularly protein-energy malnutrition.
8. Medication errors: The patient is receiving multiple medications, and there is a risk of medication errors or interactions, which could lead to adverse effects or complications.

Overall, the patient is at high risk of developing medical complications due to her underlying medical conditions, the complexity of her care, and the potential for medication errors or interactions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old woman who was admitted with cholangitis and underwent ERCP with stent placement. She was intubated due to concerns about debris in her airway and was kept on invasive ventilation overnight. She was extubated the next day with blood-tinged mucus on the endotracheal tube and required suctioning.

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady admitted with cholangitis now s/p ERCP and
   intubation with positive blood cultures (Psuedomonas by verbal
   report).  She was successfully extubated but appears to be volume
   overloaded after aggressive resuscitation.
   #. Pseudomonal Bacteremia:  Per verbal report from microbiology, the
   patient
s GNR bacteremia (2 bottles on [**6-23**]) is pseduomonas,
   sensitivites pending.  She continues to have an elevated white count
   but is afebrile and otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn x2 week course.  Narrow (or broaden) based on
   returning microbiology.
   - Daily blood cultures for surveillance
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.  Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks
   - F/U ERCP Recs re: diet
   - Continue Abx as above
   - pain control with Morphine IV
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s AM labs contained numerous
   abnormalities, significant enough to suggest they are not accurate.
   However, her thrombocytopenia is significantly concerning for DIC given
   sepsis.
   - Repeat CBC with fibrinogen & coags
   - Transfuse Cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen <100
   #. Oliguric renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is ~50/hr.
   Patient is in fact now fluid overloaded.  We will give her throughout
   the day to mobilize fluid and autodiurese before administering lasix,
   unless there is an acute change in fluid status.
   #. Dementia: Patient reportedly at baseline but will confirm with
   family in AM.  Depression component, holding Celexa & Clonazepam while
   NPO.
   .
   #. HTN: Patient currently normotensive, holding home anti-hypertensives
   (Labetalol, Captopril, Amlodipine) in the setting of recent sepsis.
   .
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO every other
   day.
   .
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.  Consider
   Morphine IV when hemodynamically stable.
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Holding Statin while NPO
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl as 50mcg IV daily
   .
   #. CAD: Holding ASA, Statin
   .
   #. FEN - NPO, No IVF, replete lytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   report).  She was successfully extubated but appears to be volume
   overloaded after aggressive resuscitation.
   #. Pseudomonal Bacteremia:  Per verbal report from microbiology, the
   patient
s GNR bacteremia (2 bottles on [**6-23**]) is pseduomonas,
   sensitivites pending.  She continues to have an elevated white count
   but is afebrile and otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn x2 week course.  Narrow (or broaden) based on
   returning microbiology.
   - Daily blood cultures for surveillance
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.  Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks
   - F/U ERCP Recs re: diet
   - Continue Abx as above
   - pain control with Morphine IV
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s AM labs contained numerous
   abnormalities, significant enough to suggest they are not accurate.
   However, her thrombocytopenia is significantly concerning for DIC given
   sepsis.
   - Repeat CBC with fibrinogen & coags
   - Transfuse Cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen <100
   #. Oliguric renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is ~50/hr.
   Patient is in fact now fluid overloaded.  We will give her throughout
   the day to mobilize fluid and autodiurese before administering lasix,
   unless there is an acute change in fluid status.
   #. Dementia: Patient reportedly at baseline but will confirm with
   family in AM.  Depression component, holding Celexa & Clonazepam while
   NPO.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old lady admitted with cholangitis who underwent ERCP with stent placement and is currently intubated. She has been experiencing respiratory distress and was kept on invasive ventilation overnight. She was extubated earlier today with blood mucous on the ET tube and required suctioning.

The patient has several medical conditions, including pseudomonal bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, oliguric renal failure, dementia, hypertension, gout, spinal stenosis, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 125/57 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 98% on 35% FiO2. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and liver enzymes, but her kidney function is improving.

The patient's medications include Cipro and Zosyn for pseudomonal bacteremia, Morphine IV for pain control, and Levoxyl for hypothyroidism. She is also receiving prophylactic medications for stress ulcer and deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's plan includes continuing antibiotics for pseudomonal bacteremia, repeat ERCP in six weeks for stent removal, and transfusion of cryoprecipitate for thrombocytopenia. She will also receive pain control with Morphine IV and hydration to mobilize fluid and autodiurese.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and need for invasive ventilation may indicate respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by the presence of blood mucous in the ET tube.
2. Sepsis: The patient's pseudomonal bacteremia and elevated white blood cell count may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding, especially with the need for invasive procedures such as ERCP.
4. Oliguric renal failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure may worsen if she becomes fluid overloaded, which can be challenging to manage.
5. Dementia: The patient's dementia may affect her ability to cooperate with medical procedures and may increase her risk of developing complications.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may affect her metabolic rate and increase her risk of developing complications such as hypothermia.
7. Coronary artery disease: The patient's coronary artery disease may increase her risk of developing cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, who was previously on invasive ventilation, was extubated in the morning. They are now receiving advanced diet and continue to receive antibiotics (Zosyn and cipro) for Pseudomonas and other Gram-negative rod (GNR) infections. Blood cultures are growing Pseudomonas and other GNR, awaiting sensitivities. The patient's code status has been changed from DNR/DNI to DNR only, allowing for intubation if there is a reversible cause.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 149/75 mmHg. They are receiving fluids and have a fluid balance of 727 mL. Their respiratory support is aerosol-cool oxygen delivery, with an SpO2 of 96%. They are also receiving medications for pain and nausea.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels, as well as abnormal liver function tests. The patient's kidney function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pseudomonas sepsis and related organ dysfunction (e.g., respiratory, renal, hepatic)
2. GNR infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections
3. Cholangitis, which may lead to sepsis, organ failure, and mortality
4. Fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances
5. Respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
6. Hepatic failure, including coagulopathy and encephalopathy
7. Renal failure, including acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD)
8. Neurological complications, including sepsis-related encephalopathy and seizures
9. Sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction
10. Malnutrition and related complications, such as muscle wasting and weakness

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent and address these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady admitted with cholangitis now s/p ERCP and
   intubation with positive blood cultures (Psuedomonas by verbal
   report).  She was successfully extubated but appears to be volume
   overloaded after aggressive resuscitation.
   #. Pseudomonal Bacteremia/GPC Bacteremia:  Cipro/Zosyn + vanc x1
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.  Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks. Advance
   diet
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  118>86, Fibrinogen, INR WNL
   #. Oliguric renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is ~80-100/hr.
   Patient is in fact now fluid overloaded.  We will give her throughout
   the day to mobilize fluid and autodiurese before administering lasix,
   unless there is an acute change in fluid status.
   #. Dementia: Patient reportedly at baseline but will confirm with
   family in AM.  Depression component, holding Celexa & Clonazepam while
   NPO.
   .
   #. HTN: Patient currently normotensive, holding home anti-hypertensives
   (Labetalol, Captopril, Amlodipine) in the setting of recent sepsis.
   .
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO every other
   day.
   .
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.  Consider
   Morphine IV when hemodynamically stable.
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Holding Statin while NPO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 84-year-old female, was admitted with cholangitis and intubated. She underwent ERCP with stent placement and was successfully extubated. However, she appears to be volume overloaded after aggressive resuscitation. Blood cultures grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and she is being treated with ciprofloxacin and piperacillin-tazobactam. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including thrombocytopenia, oliguric renal failure, dementia, hypertension, gout, spinal stenosis, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease. She is currently receiving various medications and has a DNR (do not resuscitate) code status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pseudomonal bacteremia and sepsis: The patient's blood cultures grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which can lead to sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Volume overload: The patient appears to be volume overloaded, which can lead to respiratory distress, cardiac compromise, and increased risk of complications.
3. Oliguric renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney damage. If left untreated, this can lead to acute kidney injury and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Dementia: The patient's dementia may worsen due to the ongoing medical treatment and potential complications.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may not be adequately controlled, increasing the risk of cardiac complications.
7. Gout: The patient's gout may exacerbate due to the ongoing medical treatment and potential complications.
8. Spinal stenosis: The patient's spinal stenosis may worsen due to the ongoing medical treatment and potential complications.
9. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may not be adequately controlled, increasing the risk of cardiovascular complications.
10. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may not be adequately treated, potentially leading to complications.

Based on the patient's medical history, current condition, and potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor her and adjust treatment accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady cholangitis and subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia
   s/p ERCP and intubation.  She is doing well today but has a continued
   oxygen requirement.
   #. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient
s blood cultures are positive
   for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and GPC.  She remains afebrile with a
   constant elevated WBC count.  Her current regimen of Cipro/Zosyn with
   Vancomycin added this morning should provide coverage for all of her
   organisms.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn
   - Vanc 1g first dose today, Q48 ongoing for 2 weeks
   #. Respiratory Distress: The patient still requires supplemental oxygen
   provided by shovel mask.  Her recent CXR and exam suggest that she has
   fluid overload. She has begun to increase her  urine output and we will
   allow her to autodiurese with a goal of 1L today.  If not achieved, we
   will add lasix.
   - Monitor I/Os
   - ABG today to evaluate oxygenation
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.  Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks. Advance
   diet as tolerated.
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s platelets have again dropped from
   118>86, Fibrinogen, INR wnl.  There is a concern for the accuracy of
   her labs given her difficult venous access.
   - Repeat labs today with Arterial blood gas
   #. Oliguric renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is ~80-100/hr.
   Patient is in fact now fluid overloaded.  We will give her throughout
   the day to mobilize fluid and autodiurese before administering lasix,
   unless there is an acute change in fluid status.
   #. Dementia: Overreported, patient is at baseline and doing well.
   #. HTN: Patient currently hypertensive.  Reintroducing Labetalol 200mg
   PO BID today. Continue to hold Captopril and Amlodipine.
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO daily
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Will restart statin
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl as 100mcg PO daily

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady cholangitis and subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia
   s/p ERCP and intubation.  She is doing well today but has a continued
   oxygen requirement.
   #. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient
s blood cultures are positive
   for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and GPC.  She remains afebrile with a
   constant elevated WBC count.  Her current regimen of Cipro/Zosyn with
   Vancomycin added this morning should provide coverage for all of her
   organisms.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn
   - Vanc 1g first dose today, Q48 ongoing for 2 weeks
   #. Respiratory Distress: The patient still requires supplemental oxygen
   provided by shovel mask.  Her recent CXR and exam suggest that she has
   fluid overload. She has begun to increase her  urine output and we will
   allow her to autodiurese with a goal of 1L today.  If not achieved, we
   will add lasix.
   - Monitor I/Os
   - ABG today to evaluate oxygenation
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.  Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks. Advance
   diet as tolerated.
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s platelets have again dropped from
   118>86, Fibrinogen, INR wnl.  There is a concern for the accuracy of
   her labs given her difficult venous access.
   - Repeat labs today with Arterial blood gas
   #. Oliguric renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is ~80-100/hr.
   Patient is in fact now fluid overloaded.  We will give her throughout
   the day to mobilize fluid and autodiurese before administering lasix,
   unless there is an acute change in fluid status.
   #. Dementia: Overreported, patient is at baseline and doing well.
   #. HTN: Patient currently hypertensive.  Reintroducing Labetalol 200mg
   PO BID today. Continue to hold Captopril and Amlodipine.
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO daily
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Will restart statin
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl as 100mcg PO daily

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady cholangitis and subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia
   s/p ERCP and intubation.  She is doing well today but has a continued
   oxygen requirement.
   #. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient
s blood cultures are positive
   for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, GPC and GNRs.  She remains afebrile
   with a constant elevated WBC count. She is currently on Cipro/Zosyn and
   Vancomycin added this morning should provide coverage for all of her
   organisms.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn for total two week dose
   - Vanc 1g first dose today, Q48 ongoing for 2 weeks
   - f/u cultures/speciation/sensitivities and adjust ABX as needed.
   -PICC placement this AM
   #. Respiratory Distress: The patient is not stable on room air.  Her
   recent CXR and exam suggest that she has fluid overload. She has been
   autodiuresing well above goal of 1L.  Lasix not indicated at this time.
   - Monitor I/Os
   -goal UOP is -1L
   -CXR today
   .
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.
   -Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks.
   -Advance diet as tolerated.
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s platelets have again dropped from
   118>86 and now to 54.  No heparin products. Fibrinogen, INR wnl.  The
   most likely cause is medication related and due to PPI or Vanco.  Given
   that the patient is not bleeding, requires Vanco for GPCs, will monitor
   and consider d/c meds as indicated.
   - follow platelets and transfuse for <10 or signs of bleeding.
   #. Acute renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is >100/hr.
   #. Dementia: Overreported, patient is at baseline and doing well.
   #. HTN: Patient currently hypertensive.  Yesterday started Labetalol
   200mg PO BID, still hypertensive will restart Amlodipine today and
   continue to hold Captopril..
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO daily
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: continue statin.
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl as 100mcg PO daily

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 6451**] has remained extubated without difficulty. She has had
   minimal PO intake and denies dyspnea.
   Exam notable for elderly WF with edema Tm of 98.9 BP 140/50 HRof 88 RR
   of 18 with sats of 97% on 2 lpm . There is dullness to percussion at
   bases but no evidence for wheeze.
   Labs notable for WBC 13.5 K, HCT  31.9, K+ 3.3, Cr 1.2 , alb of 2.6,
   plts of 54K  CXR with large bilateral effusions and small lung
   volumes .
   Agree with plan to continue broad Antibiotics pending sensitivities of
   GNR/ GPC's in blood. She will need gentle diuresis over next few  days
   to help with anasarca. suspect thrombocytopenia is drug related ( ? PPI
   vs Vanco).  We will follow off these medications.after PICC placement
   she will transition to medical floor for further care. Will need to
   speak wih guardian/ HCP regarding overall goals of care.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is slowly improving.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady cholangitis and subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia
   s/p ERCP and intubation.  She is doing well today but has a continued
   oxygen requirement.
   #. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient
s blood cultures are positive
   for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, GPC and GNRs.  She remains afebrile
   with a constant elevated WBC count. She is currently on Cipro/Zosyn and
   Vancomycin added this morning should provide coverage for all of her
   organisms.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn for total two week dose
   - Vanc 1g first dose today, Q48 ongoing for 2 weeks
   - f/u cultures/speciation/sensitivities and adjust ABX as needed.
   -PICC placement this AM
   #. Respiratory Distress: The patient is not stable on room air.  Her
   recent CXR and exam suggest that she has fluid overload. She has been
   autodiuresing well above goal of 1L.  Lasix not indicated at this time.
   - Monitor I/Os
   -goal UOP is -1L
   -CXR today
   .
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.
   -Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks.
   -Advance diet as tolerated.
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s platelets have again dropped from
   118>86 and now to 54.  No heparin products. Fibrinogen, INR wnl.  The
   most likely cause is medication related and due to PPI or Vanco.  Given
   that the patient is not bleeding, requires Vanco for GPCs, will monitor
   and consider d/c meds as indicated.
   - follow platelets and transfuse for <10 or signs of bleeding.
   #. Acute renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is >100/hr.
   #. Dementia: Overreported, patient is at baseline and doing well.
   #. HTN: Patient currently hypertensive.  Yesterday started Labetalol
   200mg PO BID, still hypertensive will restart Amlodipine today and
   continue to hold Captopril..
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO daily
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: continue statin.
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl as 100mcg PO daily
   .
   #. CAD: Holding ASA while thrombocytopenic

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 6451**] has remained extubated without difficulty. She has had
   minimal PO intake and denies dyspnea.
   Exam notable for elderly WF with edema Tm of 98.9 BP 140/50 HRof 88 RR
   of 18 with sats of 97% on 2 lpm . There is dullness to percussion at
   bases but no evidence for wheeze.
   Labs notable for WBC 13.5 K, HCT  31.9, K+ 3.3, Cr 1.2 , alb of 2.6,
   plts of 54K  CXR with large bilateral effusions and small lung
   volumes .
   Agree with plan to continue broad Antibiotics pending sensitivities of
   GNR/ GPC's in blood. She will need gentle diuresis over next few  days
   to help with anasarca. suspect thrombocytopenia is drug related ( ? PPI
   vs Vanco).  We will follow off these medications.after PICC placement
   she will transition to medical floor for further care. Will need to
   speak wih guardian/ HCP regarding overall goals of care.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is slowly improving.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old lady who has been admitted to the ICU with cholangitis and polymicrobial bacteremia following ERCP and intubation. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is not stable on room air, with bibasilar crackles and bowel sounds. She has a history of fluid overload, and her recent CXR suggests that she has fluid overload. Her oxygen requirement is ongoing.
* Hemodynamic: The patient's blood pressure is 145/60 mmHg, with a heart rate of 73 beats per minute. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is not mentioned.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. Her urine output is 1.5 L, with a goal of 1 L.
* Hematological: The patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 54,000/mL. The most likely cause is medication-related, possibly due to proton pump inhibitors (PPI) or vancomycin.
* Infectious: The patient has polymicrobial bacteremia, with cultures positive for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, GPC, and GNRs. She is currently receiving Cipro/Zosyn and vancomycin.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has cholangitis, with a history of ERCP and stent placement.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's fluid overload and respiratory distress can lead to respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's polymicrobial bacteremia can lead to sepsis, which may require aggressive management with antibiotics, fluids, and vasopressors.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can lead to bleeding complications, which may require platelet transfusions.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure can progress to acute kidney injury, which may require dialysis.
5. Cholangitis: The patient's cholangitis can lead to further complications, such as abscess formation, biliary sepsis, or liver failure.

The plan of care for the patient includes:

1. Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics pending sensitivities of GNR/ GPC's in blood.
2. Gentle diuresis over the next few days to help with anasarca.
3. Monitoring and considering discontinuing medications that may be causing thrombocytopenia.
4. Transitioning the patient to the medical floor for further care after PICC placement.
5. Speaking with the guardian/ HCP regarding overall goals of care.

Overall, the patient is slowly improving, but requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities. The patient has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of Acinetobacter in the blood, along with Pseudomonas and GPCs. The patient has also experienced an unexplained drop in hemoglobin concentration, which is being investigated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), a heart rate of 73 beats per minute, and a blood pressure of 145/60 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 97%. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute.

The patient has a history of antibiotic administration, including Metronidazole, Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient is also receiving Pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.7, a hemoglobin concentration of 31.9 g/dL, and a platelet count of 82. The patient's creatinine level is 1.5 mg/dL, and the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 16 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient has a pending guaiac test to assess for gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's imaging studies, including chest X-rays and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans, are pending.

The patient's medical history is significant for a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate). The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and antibiotics. The patient's nutritional status is being managed with enteral nutrition.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's blood cultures are positive for Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and GPCs, which increases the risk of sepsis.
2. Hemorrhage: The patient's unexplained drop in hemoglobin concentration and guaiac test pending suggest the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL and BUN level of 16 mg/dL suggest the possibility of acute kidney injury.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but the patient's condition may lead to electrolyte imbalances.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the patient's condition may lead to respiratory failure.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but the patient's condition may lead to cardiovascular instability.

In summary, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities, including sepsis, hemorrhage, acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalance, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular instability. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady cholangitis and subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia
   s/p ERCP and intubation.  She is doing well today but has a continued
   oxygen requirement.
   #. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient
s blood cultures are positive
   for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and GPC.  She remains afebrile with a
   constant elevated WBC count.  Her current regimen of Cipro/Zosyn with
   Vancomycin added this morning should provide coverage for all of her
   organisms.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn
   - Vanc 1g first dose today, Q48 ongoing for 2 weeks
   #. Respiratory Distress: The patient still requires supplemental oxygen
   provided by shovel mask.  Her recent CXR and exam suggest that she has
   fluid overload. She has begun to increase her  urine output and we will
   allow her to autodiurese with a goal of 1L today.  If not achieved, we
   will add lasix.
   - Monitor I/Os
   - ABG today to evaluate oxygenation
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.  Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks. Advance
   diet as tolerated.
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s platelets have again dropped from
   118>86, Fibrinogen, INR wnl.  There is a concern for the accuracy of
   her labs given her difficult venous access.
   - Repeat labs today with Arterial blood gas
   #. Oliguric renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is ~80-100/hr.
    Patient is in fact now fluid overloaded.  We will give her throughout
   the day to mobilize fluid and autodiurese before administering lasix,
   unless there is an acute change in fluid status.
   #. Dementia: Overreported, patient is at baseline and doing well.
   #. HTN: Patient currently hypertensive.  Reintroducing Labetalol 200mg
   PO BID today. Continue to hold Captopril and Amlodipine.
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO daily
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Will restart statin
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl as 100mcg PO daily
   .
   #. CAD: Holding ASA while thrombocytopenia is sorted out
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady cholangitis and subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia
   s/p ERCP and intubation.  She is doing well today but has a continued
   oxygen requirement.
   #. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient
s blood cultures are positive
   for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and GPC.  She remains afebrile with a
   constant elevated WBC count.  Her current regimen of Cipro/Zosyn with
   Vancomycin added this morning should provide coverage for all of her
   organisms.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn
   - Vanc 1g first dose today, Q48 ongoing for 2 weeks
   #. Respiratory Distress: The patient still requires supplemental oxygen
   provided by shovel mask.  Her recent CXR and exam suggest that she has
   fluid overload. She has begun to increase her  urine output and we will
   allow her to autodiurese with a goal of 1L today.  If not achieved, we
   will add lasix.
   - Monitor I/Os
   - ABG today to evaluate oxygenation
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.  Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks. Advance
   diet as tolerated.
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s platelets have again dropped from
   118>86, Fibrinogen, INR wnl.  There is a concern for the accuracy of
   her labs given her difficult venous access.
   - Repeat labs today with Arterial blood gas
   #. Oliguric renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is ~80-100/hr.
    Patient is in fact now fluid overloaded.  We will give her throughout
   the day to mobilize fluid and autodiurese before administering lasix,
   unless there is an acute change in fluid status.
   #. Dementia: Overreported, patient is at baseline and doing well.
   #. HTN: Patient currently hypertensive.  Reintroducing Labetalol 200mg
   PO BID today. Continue to hold Captopril and Amlodipine.
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO daily
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Will restart statin
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl as 100mcg PO daily
   .
   #. CAD: Holding ASA while thrombocytopenia is sorted out

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old lady admitted to the ICU with cholangitis and polymicrobial bacteremia. She has been treated with Ciprofloxacin, Zosyn, and Vancomycin, and her blood cultures are positive for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and GPC.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (98.9°F)
* Heart rate: 73 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 145/60 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination is notable for bibasilar crackles and bowel sounds, with no signs of respiratory distress. Her abdomen is tender but soft and non-distended, and her extremities are without edema or signs of deep venous thrombosis.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.7 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 10.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 82 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 16 mg/dL
* Sodium: 135 mmol/L
* Potassium: 4.3 mmol/L
* Chloride: 103 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.6 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.4 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.3 mg/dL

The patient's fluid status is complicated by oliguric renal failure, and she is currently receiving fluid therapy. Her urine output is approximately 1.5 L, and she is being monitored closely for signs of fluid overload.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen requirement and bibasilar crackles suggest a risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's polymicrobial bacteremia and oliguric renal failure increase her risk of sepsis.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and there is a concern for the accuracy of her labs due to difficult venous access.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid status is complicated, and she is at risk of fluid overload.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's cholangitis and polymicrobial bacteremia increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

In summary, the patient is an 84-year-old lady with cholangitis and polymicrobial bacteremia, who is being treated with antibiotics and fluids. She is at risk for respiratory failure, sepsis, thrombocytopenia, fluid overload, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent these complications and optimize her care."

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady cholangitis and subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia
   s/p ERCP and intubation.  She is doing well today but has a continued
   oxygen requirement.
   #. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient
s blood cultures are positive
   for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, GPC and GNRs.  She remains afebrile
   with a constant elevated WBC count. She is currently on Cipro/Zosyn and
   Vancomycin added this morning should provide coverage for all of her
   organisms.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn for total two week dose
   - Vanc 1g first dose today, Q48 ongoing for 2 weeks
   - f/u cultures/speciation/sensitivities and adjust ABX as needed.
   -PICC placement this AM
   #. Respiratory Distress: The patient is not stable on room air.  Her
   recent CXR and exam suggest that she has fluid overload. She has been
   autodiuresing well above goal of 1L.  Lasix not indicated at this time.
   - Monitor I/Os
   -goal UOP is -1L
   -CXR today
   .
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.
   -Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks.
   -Advance diet as tolerated.
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s platelets have again dropped from
   118>86 and now to 54.  No heparin products. Fibrinogen, INR wnl.  The
   most likely cause is medication related and due to PPI or Vanco.  Given
   that the patient is not bleeding, requires Vanco for GPCs, will monitor
   and consider d/c meds as indicated.
   - follow platelets and transfuse for <10 or signs of bleeding.
   #. Acute renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is >100/hr.
   #. Dementia: Overreported, patient is at baseline and doing well.
   #. HTN: Patient currently hypertensive.  Yesterday started Labetalol
   200mg PO BID, still hypertensive will restart Amlodipine today and
   continue to hold Captopril..
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO daily
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: continue statin.
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl as 100mcg PO daily

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady cholangitis and subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia
   s/p ERCP and intubation.  She is doing well today but has a continued
   oxygen requirement.
   #. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient
s blood cultures are positive
   for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, GPC and GNRs.  She remains afebrile
   with a constant elevated WBC count. She is currently on Cipro/Zosyn and
   Vancomycin added this morning should provide coverage for all of her
   organisms.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn for total two week dose
   - Vanc 1g first dose today, Q48 ongoing for 2 weeks
   - f/u cultures/speciation/sensitivities and adjust ABX as needed.
   -PICC placement this AM
   #. Respiratory Distress: The patient is not stable on room air.  Her
   recent CXR and exam suggest that she has fluid overload. She has been
   autodiuresing well above goal of 1L.  Lasix not indicated at this time.
   - Monitor I/Os
   -goal UOP is -1L
   -CXR today
   .
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.
   -Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks.
   -Advance diet as tolerated.
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s platelets have again dropped from
   118>86 and now to 54.  No heparin products. Fibrinogen, INR wnl.  The
   most likely cause is medication related and due to PPI or Vanco.  Given
   that the patient is not bleeding, requires Vanco for GPCs, will monitor
   and consider d/c meds as indicated.
   - follow platelets and transfuse for <10 or signs of bleeding.
   #. Acute renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is >100/hr.
   #. Dementia: Overreported, patient is at baseline and doing well.
   #. HTN: Patient currently hypertensive.  Yesterday started Labetalol
   200mg PO BID, still hypertensive will restart Amlodipine today and
   continue to hold Captopril..
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO daily
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: continue statin.
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl as 100mcg PO daily
   .
   #. CAD: Holding ASA while thrombocytopenic
