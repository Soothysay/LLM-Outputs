   1. Diffusely echogenic liver, consistent with fatty infiltration. Note

   2. No evidence of cholecystitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old male who was recently hospitalized for ETOH withdrawl,
   seizures, transaminitis, possible pancreatitis and left AMA late last
   night who was readmitted to [**Hospital1 17**] this morning with altered mental
   status, blood alcohol level >100 and transferred for management of
   presumed alcohol withdrawl.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Per report patient delerius this morning.
   Given that he was only out of the hospital for several hours, this was
   most likely due to intoxication rather than ETOH withdrawl(urine and
   serum tox o/w negative.  However, the patient also has history of
   seizure and CVA w/known PFO (not anticoagulated) and transaminitis
   which could all cause AMS.  CVA less likely  as his neuro exam is
   non-focal except for mildly deficient strength in his left arm which
   chronic.  Seizure also less likely to be responsible for entire picture
   as would expect patient's delirium to have resolved.
   -CIWA scale with Ativan given LFT abnormalities
   -Thiamine, Folate, MVI
   -f/u final read of head CT given
   -Continue Keppra and Lamictal as outlined per neuro during previous
   admission
   -Neuro Consult in AM
   -Check LFTs
   -If patient worsening or developing focal neurologic signs, could
   consider MRI head.
   .
   # Throbocytopenia: Patient intermittently thrombocytopenic over the
   last year, associated occasionally with lymphopenia, though now just
   thrombocytopenia.  Most likely related to ETOH, as no apparent
   medication effect temporally.  Also unlikely HIT/heparin antibodies as
   not temporally related to admissions but need to assess further when he
   actually received heparin products.
   -daily plt
   -pneumoboots for now pending investigation into timing of heparin
   .
   # Transaminitis:During previous admission, LFTs trended down when
   patient not drinking, simvastatin held.  Hep serologies are negative,
   HIV negative, RUQ U/S with fatty infiltrate but no other abnormality.
   -hold remeron for now, continue to hold simvastatin.
   -check LFTs today, if trending down most likely [**3-13**] simvastatin
   -if trending up could be related to ETOH use, medication effect
   .
   # Increased Lipase: Lipase 70 when patient left hospital.  Patient
   denies nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
   -recheck Lipase
   -NPO for now pending lipase, can likely advance diet if lipase trending
   down.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely related to agitation/ETOH withdrawl, but patient
   with dry MM, so ? volume depletion:
   -bolus NS
   -125 cc/hr IVF
   -EKG when patient calm
   .
   # History of PFO: Patient seen by cardiology in [**Month (only) **], and they
   recommended full dose aspirin but no further intervention unless
   patient has a second stroke.
   .
   # Non-displaced fracture of the proximal radius: Found at last
   admission, per report ?ortho did a nerve block at this time.  Patient
   without complain of arm pain today.
   .
   #History of pyomyositis/clavicular osteo: Patient completed 6 week
   course of Vanco on [**2130-10-6**], currently stable.  If patient spikes fever
   would consider this source.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Altered mental status: likely due to intoxication, but also consider history of seizure and CVA with known PFO
* Thrombocytopenia: likely related to ethanol, but also consider medication effect or HIT/heparin antibodies
* Transaminitis: likely related to ethanol use, but also consider medication effect or underlying liver disease
* Increased lipase: likely related to pancreatitis, but patient denies nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain
* Tachycardia: likely related to agitation or ethanol withdrawal, but patient with dry MM, so consider volume depletion
* History of PFO: patient seen by cardiology and recommended full-dose aspirin, but no further intervention unless patient has a second stroke
* Non-displaced fracture of the proximal radius: patient without complain of arm pain today
* History of pyomyositis/clavicular osteomyelitis: patient completed 6-week course of Vancomycin and is currently stable

The patient's ICU care includes:

* Nutrition: NPO for now
* Glycemic control: not specified
* Lines: 20-gauge central line inserted
* Prophylaxis: pneumoboots for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis
* Comments: patient is at high risk for complications, and close monitoring is necessary.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued ethanol withdrawal symptoms, such as seizures or delirium
* Pancreatitis or worsening of transaminitis
* Thrombocytopenia or bleeding complications
* Infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure
* Neurological complications, such as stroke or seizure
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or bleeding."

   1. Diffusely echogenic liver, consistent with fatty infiltration. Note
   that coexisting forms of hepatic disease such as cirrhosis are not
   excluded.
   2. No evidence of cholecystitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old male who was recently hospitalized for ETOH withdrawl,
   seizures, transaminitis, possible pancreatitis and left AMA late last
   night who was readmitted to [**Hospital1 17**] this morning with altered mental
   status, blood alcohol level >100 and transferred for management of
   presumed alcohol withdrawl.
   .
   # Altered mental status: most likely due to ETOH withdrawl that he
   didn
t finish during last admission when he left AMA.  Also, with pt
   h/o seizure and stroke,  both could also cause AMS.  However, the
   patient also has history of seizure and CVA w/known PFO (not
   anticoagulated) and transaminitis which could all cause AMS.  CVA less
   likely  as his neuro exam is non-focal except for mildly deficient
   strength in his left arm which chronic.  Seizure also less likely to be
   responsible for entire picture as would expect patient's delirium to
   have resolved.
   -CIWA scale with Ativan given LFT abnormalities
   -Thiamine, Folate, MVI
   -f/u final read of head CT given
   -Continue Keppra and Lamictal as outlined per neuro during previous
   admission
   -Neuro Consult in AM
   -Check LFTs
   -If patient worsening or developing focal neurologic signs, could
   consider MRI head.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Patient intermittently thrombocytopenic over the
   last year, associated occasionally with lymphopenia, though now just
   thrombocytopenia.  Most likely related to ETOH, as no apparent
   medication effect temporally.  Also unlikely HIT/heparin antibodies as
   not temporally related to admissions but need to assess further when he
   actually received heparin products.
   -daily plt
   -pneumoboots for now pending investigation into timing of heparin
   .
   # Transaminitis:During previous admission, LFTs trended down when
   patient not drinking, simvastatin held.  Hep serologies are negative,
   HIV negative, RUQ U/S with fatty infiltrate but no other abnormality.
   -hold remeron for now, continue to hold simvastatin.
   -check LFTs today, if trending down most likely [**3-13**] simvastatin
   -if trending up could be related to ETOH use, medication effect
   .
   # Increased Lipase: Lipase 70 when patient left hospital.  Patient
   denies nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
   -recheck Lipase
   -NPO for now pending lipase, can likely advance diet if lipase trending
   down.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely related to agitation/ETOH withdrawl, but patient
   with dry MM, so ? volume depletion:
   -bolus NS
   -125 cc/hr IVF
   -EKG when patient calm
   .
   # History of PFO: Patient seen by cardiology in [**Month (only) **], and they
   recommended full dose aspirin but no further intervention unless
   patient has a second stroke.
   .
   # Non-displaced fracture of the proximal radius: Found at last
   admission, per report ?ortho did a nerve block at this time.  Patient
   without complain of arm pain today.
   .
   #History of pyomyositis/clavicular osteo: Patient completed 6 week
   course of Vanco on [**2130-10-6**], currently stable.  If patient spikes fever
   would consider this source.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old male who was recently hospitalized for ethanol (ETOH) withdrawal, seizures, transaminitis, and possible pancreatitis. He was readmitted to the hospital with altered mental status, blood alcohol level >100, and was transferred to the ICU for management of presumed alcohol withdrawal. The patient has a history of seizure, stroke, and PFO (patent foramen ovale), which could all cause altered mental status. The patient's current condition is complicated by CIWA scale with Ativan given, LFT abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, increased lipase, and tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure: The patient has a history of seizure and CVA (cerebral vascular accident) with known PFO, which could cause altered mental status. The patient's neuro exam is non-focal except for mildly deficient strength in his left arm, which is chronic.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of pyomyositis/clavicular osteomyelitis, which could be a source of infection if the patient spikes a fever.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has intermittent thrombocytopenia over the last year, which is likely related to ETOH use. The patient's platelet count is currently 89 K/uL.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has LFT abnormalities, which are likely related to ETOH use. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) trended down when the patient was not drinking, but the patient's LFTs are currently trending up.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of possible pancreatitis, which could be a source of abdominal pain and elevated lipase levels.
6. Volume Depletion: The patient has tachycardia, which could be related to agitation/ETOH withdrawal. The patient's MM (mouth mucous) is dry, which suggests possible volume depletion.
7. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a history of PFO and is currently receiving pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis. The patient's SpO2 is 96%, which suggests possible pulmonary embolism.

Recommendations:

1. Continue CIWA scale with Ativan given to manage the patient's agitation and ETOH withdrawal.
2. Monitor the patient's LFTs and adjust the patient's medication regimen as necessary.
3. Continue thrombocytopenia prophylaxis with daily platelet counts and pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.
4. Monitor the patient's lipase levels and adjust the patient's diet as necessary.
5. Consider an MRI head if the patient's condition worsens or develops focal neurologic signs.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and adjust the patient's medication regimen as necessary.
7. Consider a neurology consult to further evaluate the patient's altered mental status and potential seizure risk."

   2. No evidence of cholecystitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old male who was recently hospitalized for ETOH withdrawl,
   seizures, transaminitis, possible pancreatitis and left AMA late last
   night who was readmitted to [**Hospital1 17**] this morning with altered mental
   status, blood alcohol level >100 and transferred for management of
   presumed alcohol withdrawl.
   .
   # Altered mental status: most likely due to ETOH withdrawl that he
   didn
t finish during last admission when he left AMA.  Also, with pt
   h/o seizure and stroke,  both could also cause AMS.  Stroke is unlikley
   bc neuro exam intact eexcept for chronic weakness in left arm s/p
   infection there. Seizure also less likely bc pt
s AMS persisted too
   long.
   -continue CIWA scale with Ativan IV PRN for now, will consider
   switching to PO Valium longer coverage
   -f/u final read of head CT, CT C-spine
   -Continue Keppra and Lamictal as outlined per neuro during previous
   admission, however Neuro saw pt this AM and will return with final recs
   regarding this meds and doses
   -f/u Neuro recs: current symptoms not liely from h/o of stroke, agree
   with treatment of ETOH withdrawal, Keppra can be given IV if PO not
   tolerated
   -If patient worsening or developing focal neurologic signs, could
   consider MRI head.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Patient intermittently thrombocytopenic over the
   last year. Most likely related to ETOH.  HIT also on diff however
   unlikely bc not correlating to Heparin exposure and clinically no signs
   of clotting, etc.
   -monitor daily plt
   -SC heparin for DVT ppx initially held, however will start today
   .
   # Elev CK: Likely [**3-13**] to immobilization or injury from ETOH
   abuse/withdrawal.  Hypothyroidism is a possible cause as well, however
   TSH wnl recently.
   - trend CK
   - continue aggressive hydration with IVF
   .
   # Transaminitis: During Likely [**3-13**] ETOH abuse.  Hep serologies indicate
   pt is HCV positive. Pt is HIV negative. Recent RUQ U/S with fatty
   infiltrate but no other abnormality.
   -hold remeron and simvastatin for now
   -check daily LFTs
   -order viral HCV load and consider liver c/s or give pt outpt f/u
   .
   # Increased Lipase: Lipase 70 when patient left hospital.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely related to agitation/ETOH withdrawl, but patient
   with dry MM, so could also be volume depletion.
   -continue IVF
   -EKG when patient calm
   .
   # History of PFO:  stable
   - continue full dose aspirin
   .
   # Non-displaced fracture of the proximal radius: Found at last
   admission, per report ?ortho did a nerve block at this time.
   -pt not complaining of any pain

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male who was recently hospitalized for ETOH withdrawal, seizures, transaminitis, and possible pancreatitis. He was readmitted to the hospital with altered mental status, blood alcohol level >100, and transferred for management of presumed alcohol withdrawal.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Altered mental status: most likely due to ETOH withdrawal, but also possible causes include seizure and stroke.
* Thrombocytopenia: likely related to ETOH abuse, but also possible cause is HIT, although unlikely.
* Elev CK: likely due to immobilization or injury from ETOH abuse/withdrawal, or hypothyroidism.
* Transaminitis: likely due to ETOH abuse, with HCV positivity and no other abnormality on RUQ U/S.
* Increased Lipase: currently resolved.
* Tachycardia: likely related to agitation/ETOH withdrawal, but also possible cause is volume depletion.

The patient's labs and radiology results are as follows:

* WBC: 6.1
* Hct: 33.5
* Plt: 89
* Cr: 0.9
* Glucose: 88
* Amylase: 34
* Lipase: 3042
* Albumin: 4.3 g/dL
* Ca++: 8.9 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.2 mg/dL
* ABG: 22
* Urine: yellow, clear, with few bacteria and no yeast
* Imaging: CT head w/o contrast shows no acute intracranial process, CT C-spine shows no acute fracture, RUQ U/S shows diffusely echogenic liver with fatty infiltration.

The patient's plan is as follows:

* Continue CIWA scale with Ativan IV PRN for now, considering switching to PO Valium for longer coverage.
* Follow up on final read of head CT and CT C-spine.
* Continue Keppra and Lamictal as outlined per neuro during previous admission, pending final recommendations from neuro regarding medication and doses.
* If patient worsens or develops focal neurologic signs, consider MRI head.
* Monitor daily plt and start SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
* Trend CK and continue aggressive hydration with IVF.
* Hold remeron and simvastatin for now, check daily LFTs, and order viral HCV load and consider liver c/s or give pt outpt f/u.
* Continue full dose aspirin for PFO.
* If patient spikes fever, consider source of infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Worsening of ETOH withdrawal symptoms, leading to seizures, stroke, or other complications.
* Development of focal neurologic signs or worsening of current symptoms, requiring further imaging or intervention.
* Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia or liver disease.
* Progression of liver disease or development of liver failure.
* Complications related to immobilization, such as DVT or PE.
* Infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis, due to immunosuppression or other factors.
* Cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or MI, due to ETOH withdrawal or other factors.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   with treatment of ETOH withdrawal, Keppra can be given IV if PO not
   tolerated
   -If patient worsening or developing focal neurologic signs, could
   consider MRI head.

   # Thrombocytopenia: Patient intermittently thrombocytopenic over the
   last year. Most likely related to ETOH.  HIT also on diff however
   unlikely bc not correlating to Heparin exposure and clinically no signs
   of clotting, etc.
   -monitor daily plt
   -SC heparin for DVT ppx initially held, however will start today

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old male who was recently hospitalized for ethanol (ETOH) withdrawal, seizures, transaminitis, and possible pancreatitis. He was readmitted to the ICU with altered mental status, blood alcohol level >100, and presumed alcohol withdrawal. The patient is currently receiving Keppra and Lamictal for seizure prophylaxis and is being managed for ETOH withdrawal with CIWA scale and Ativan IV PRN. He is also receiving SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Seizure recurrence: The patient is at risk for seizure recurrence due to his history of seizures and ongoing ETOH withdrawal.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient's elevated CK levels may be related to hypothyroidism, which could worsen his condition if left untreated.
4. Hepatitis C: The patient's HCV positivity increases his risk of liver damage and potential liver failure.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient's history of pancreatitis and elevated lipase levels may indicate ongoing pancreatic inflammation, which can lead to severe complications if left untreated.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's intermittent thrombocytopenia may worsen with continued ETOH withdrawal and may require closer monitoring.
7. DVT: The patient's history of PFO and SC heparin use for DVT prophylaxis increases his risk of developing a DVT.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient's altered mental status and ETOH withdrawal may increase his risk of developing a stress ulcer, which can lead to bleeding and other complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue Keppra and Lamictal as prescribed by the neurologist.
2. Monitor the patient's mental status closely for signs of delirium or worsening ETOH withdrawal.
3. Trend the patient's CK levels to monitor for potential hypothyroidism.
4. Continue SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis and monitor for signs of thrombocytopenia.
5. Monitor the patient's liver function tests (LFTs) and consider ordering a viral HCV load to determine the severity of his HCV infection.
6. Consider ordering a liver c/s or referring the patient for outpatient follow-up to manage his HCV infection.
7. Monitor the patient's pancreatic enzymes and consider ordering a pancreatic ultrasound to rule out ongoing pancreatic inflammation.
8. Continue full-dose aspirin for PFO prophylaxis and monitor for signs of bleeding or other complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old male who was recently hospitalized for ethanol withdrawal, seizures, transaminitis, and possible pancreatitis. He was readmitted to the hospital with altered mental status, blood alcohol level >100, and transferred to the ICU for management of presumed alcohol withdrawal. The patient's current condition is stable, with ongoing treatment for his underlying conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued ethanol withdrawal symptoms, including seizures and altered mental status, which may worsen if not properly managed.
2. Thrombocytopenia, which may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly if the patient's platelet count continues to decline.
3. Transaminitis, which may progress to liver damage if not properly managed, and may be exacerbated by ongoing ethanol abuse.
4. Increased lipase levels, which may indicate pancreatitis or other pancreatic issues.
5. History of pyomyositis and clavicular osteomyelitis, which may recur if not properly treated, and may be a source of ongoing infection.
6. Non-displaced fracture of the proximal radius, which may cause ongoing pain and discomfort if not properly managed.
7. Potential for venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to the patient's history of thrombocytopenia and the use of heparin prophylaxis.
8. Risk of stress ulcers due to the patient's underlying medical conditions and the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's ethanol withdrawal symptoms and adjust treatment as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust treatment for thrombocytopenia as needed.
3. Continue to manage the patient's transaminitis and liver function tests (LFTs) closely.
4. Monitor the patient's lipase levels and adjust treatment for pancreatitis or other pancreatic issues as needed.
5. Continue to manage the patient's pyomyositis and clavicular osteomyelitis, and monitor for signs of recurrence.
6. Manage the patient's non-displaced fracture of the proximal radius, and monitor for signs of worsening pain or discomfort.
7. Monitor the patient for signs of VTE, and adjust treatment as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's stress ulcer risk, and adjust treatment as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old male who was recently hospitalized for ETOH withdrawl,
   seizures, transaminitis, possible pancreatitis and left AMA late last
   night who was readmitted to [**Hospital1 17**] this morning with altered mental
   status, blood alcohol level >100 and transferred for management of
   presumed alcohol withdrawl.
   .
   # Altered mental status: most likely due to ETOH withdrawl that he
   didn
t finish during last admission when he left AMA.  Also, with pt
   h/o seizure and stroke,  both could also cause AMS.  Stroke is unlikley
   bc neuro exam intact eexcept for chronic weakness in left arm s/p
   infection there. Seizure also less likely bc pt
s AMS persisted too
   long.
   -continue CIWA scale with 10mg PO Vlaium q2h and Ativan IV PRN for now
   -per Neuro: increase keppra to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **], cont lamictal at current
   dose of 200mg daily and f/u level from [**10-20**]. ativan IV prn seizure >5
   min or seizure cluster. avoid medications that may reduce his seizure
   threshold (i.e., fluoroquinolones, flagyl, antipsychotics). would
   prefer zyprexa or seroquel over halodol if needed for agitation.
   - neuro made an outpatient appt for pt on [**11-24**] at 1:30pm
   - f/u any new Neuro recs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Patient intermittently thrombocytopenic over the
   last year. Most likely related to ETOH.
   -monitor daily plt and any signs of acute bleeding
   .
   # Elev CK: Likely [**3-13**] to injury/ETOH.  Hypothyroidism is a possible
   cause as well, however TSH wnl recently.
   - CK trending down
   - continue hydration with IVF PRN
   .
   # Transaminitis: During Likely [**3-13**] ETOH abuse.  Hep serologies indicate
   pt is HCV positive. Pt is HIV negative. Recent RUQ U/S with fatty
   infiltrate but no other abnormality.
   -hold remeron and simvastatin for now
   -check daily LFTs
   -pt to f/u with liver as outpatient
   .
   # Increased Lipase: Lipase 70 when patient left hospital.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # History of PFO:  stable
   - continue full dose aspirin
   .
   # Non-displaced fracture of the proximal radius: Found at last
   admission, per report ?ortho did a nerve block at this time.
   -pt not complaining of any pain currently
   .
   #History of pyomyositis/clavicular osteo: Patient completed 6 week
   course of Vanco on [**2130-10-6**], currently stable.  If patient spikes fever
   would consider this source.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old male who was recently hospitalized for ethanol withdrawal, seizures, transaminitis, and possible pancreatitis. He was readmitted to the hospital with altered mental status, blood alcohol level >100, and transferred to the ICU for management of presumed alcohol withdrawal. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, and blood pressure of 109/73 mmHg. He is receiving IV fluids, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient's AMS may be due to ethanol withdrawal, seizure, or stroke. Close monitoring of the patient's mental status and neurological exam is essential to rule out any underlying conditions.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be related to ethanol abuse or other underlying conditions. Monitoring of the patient's platelet count and signs of acute bleeding is necessary.
3. Elevated Creatine Kinase (CK): The patient's elevated CK may be due to injury, ethanol abuse, or hypothyroidism. Monitoring of the patient's CK levels and hydration status is essential.
4. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis may be due to ethanol abuse or other underlying conditions. Monitoring of the patient's liver function tests (LFTs) and liver enzymes is necessary.
5. History of PFO: The patient's history of patent foramen ovale (PFO) may increase his risk of paradoxical embolism. Monitoring of the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status is essential.
6. Non-displaced fracture of the proximal radius: The patient's non-displaced fracture of the proximal radius may lead to complications such as nerve damage or infection. Monitoring of the patient's pain and neurological status is necessary.
7. History of pyomyositis/clavicular osteomyelitis: The patient's history of pyomyositis/clavicular osteomyelitis may lead to recurrent infections or complications. Monitoring of the patient's temperature and white blood cell count is necessary.

ICU Care:

The patient is receiving ICU care, including clear liquids and IV fluids. He is also receiving prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin sodium and stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole. The patient's code status is full, and he is being considered for transfer to the floor today."

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old male who was recently hospitalized for ETOH withdrawl,
   seizures, transaminitis, possible pancreatitis and left AMA late last
   night who was readmitted to [**Hospital1 17**] this morning with altered mental
   status, blood alcohol level >100 and transferred for management of
   presumed alcohol withdrawl.
   .
   # Altered mental status: most likely due to ETOH withdrawl that he
   didn
t finish during last admission when he left AMA.  Also, with pt
   h/o seizure and stroke,  both could also cause AMS.  Stroke is unlikley
   bc neuro exam intact eexcept for chronic weakness in left arm s/p
   infection there. Seizure also less likely bc pt
s AMS persisted too
   long.
   -continue CIWA scale with 10mg PO Vlaium q2h and Ativan IV PRN for now
   -per Neuro: increase keppra to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **], cont lamictal at current
   dose of 200mg daily and f/u level from [**10-20**]. ativan IV prn seizure >5
   min or seizure cluster. avoid medications that may reduce his seizure
   threshold (i.e., fluoroquinolones, flagyl, antipsychotics). would
   prefer zyprexa or seroquel over halodol if needed for agitation.
   - neuro made an outpatient appt for pt on [**11-24**] at 1:30pm
   - f/u any new Neuro recs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Patient intermittently thrombocytopenic over the
   last year. Most likely related to ETOH.
   -monitor daily plt and any signs of acute bleeding
   .
   # Elev CK: Likely [**3-13**] to injury/ETOH.  Hypothyroidism is a possible
   cause as well, however TSH wnl recently.
   - CK trending down
   - continue hydration with IVF PRN
   .
   # Transaminitis: During Likely [**3-13**] ETOH abuse.  Hep serologies indicate
   pt is HCV positive. Pt is HIV negative. Recent RUQ U/S with fatty
   infiltrate but no other abnormality.
   -hold remeron and simvastatin for now
   -check daily LFTs
   -pt to f/u with liver as outpatient
   .
   # Increased Lipase: Lipase 70 when patient left hospital.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # History of PFO:  stable
   - continue full dose aspirin
   .
   # Non-displaced fracture of the proximal radius: Found at last
   admission, per report ?ortho did a nerve block at this time.
   -pt not complaining of any pain currently
   .
   #History of pyomyositis/clavicular osteo: Patient completed 6 week
   course of Vanco on [**2130-10-6**], currently stable.  If patient spikes fever
   would consider this source.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 47-year-old male who was recently hospitalized for ethanol withdrawal, seizures, transaminitis, and possible pancreatitis. He was readmitted to the hospital with altered mental status, blood alcohol level >100, and was transferred for management of presumed alcohol withdrawal. The patient has a history of seizures, stroke, and thrombocytopenia, and is currently experiencing elevated CK levels, transaminitis, and lipase elevation.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Seizure recurrence**: The patient has a history of seizures and is currently taking Keppra and Lamictal. However, the patient's AMS persisted for an extended period, which may increase the risk of seizure recurrence.
2. **Alcohol withdrawal syndrome**: The patient is experiencing withdrawal symptoms, including AMS, which may worsen if not managed appropriately.
3. **Thrombocytopenia**: The patient's platelet count is low, and monitoring is necessary to detect any signs of acute bleeding.
4. **CK elevation**: The patient's CK levels are elevated, which may indicate muscle injury or ETOH abuse. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause.
5. **Transaminitis**: The patient's transaminitis is likely related to ETOH abuse, and monitoring of liver function tests is necessary to detect any worsening of liver damage.
6. **Infection**: The patient has a history of pyomyositis and clavicular osteo, which may increase the risk of infection. Monitoring for fever and other signs of infection is necessary.
7. **VAP**: The patient is at risk for VAP due to prolonged intubation.
8. **DVT**: The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and thrombocytopenia.
9. **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: The patient's elevated lipase levels may indicate pancreatitis, which may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue CIWA scale with 10mg PO Valium q2h and Ativan IV PRN for alcohol withdrawal management.
2. Increase Keppra to 1000mg and continue Lamictal at the current dose of 200mg daily.
3. Monitor platelet count daily and monitor for signs of acute bleeding.
4. Continue hydration with IVF PRN and monitor CK levels.
5. Hold Remeron and Simvastatin for now and monitor liver function tests.
6. Check daily LFTs and follow up with liver as an outpatient.
7. Continue full dose aspirin for PFO.
8. Monitor for signs of infection, including fever, and consider antibiotics if necessary.
9. Monitor for VAP and DVT, and consider prophylactic measures if necessary.
10. Monitor for gastrointestinal bleeding and consider endoscopy if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   47 yo patient with history of EtOH abuse and EtOH withdrawl as well as
   an independent history of seizure disorder now admitted with acute
   intoxication and has been supported through withdrawl with CIWA scale
   guided dosing of Valium with better response seen to Valium than Ativan
   interestingly.
   1) ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)-
   -Continue with Thiamine/Folate
   -Continue with CIWA scale guided valium dosing
   -will have to clarify any desire for detox and systematic approach to
   discontinuation of EtOH abuse.
   2)Seizure Disorder-
   Patient with signfiicant seizure disorder outside of EtOH withdrawl
   -Continue with seizure meds as defined by neurology consult service
   (Lamictal/Keppra)

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of EtOH intoxication and withdrawal. He has a history of EtOH abuse and seizure disorder.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 118/85 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 94% on room air.

The patient's physical examination reveals a normal cardiovascular examination, with distant S2 and normal S1. His peripheral vascular examination is unremarkable, with no palpable pulses in his right and left radial and dorsal pedal arteries. His respiratory examination shows symmetric expansion, dullness, and diminished breath sounds. His skin examination is not assessed, and his neurologic examination shows that he follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to person, place, and movement.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.1 K/μL, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 129 K/μL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a sodium level of 139 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, and chloride level of 103 mEq/L. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are normal.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net loss of 30 mL, with a total intake of 2,660 mL and a total output of 2,630 mL. His urine output is 2,630 mL, and his blood products have been transfused.

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery at 2 L/min, and his ABG shows a pH of 7.4, pCO2 of 35 mmHg, and pO2 of 94 mmHg.

The patient's medical history is significant for EtOH abuse and seizure disorder. He has a history of seizures, and his current medication regimen includes Lamictal and Keppra.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing his thiamine and folate supplementation, CIWA scale-guided Valium dosing, and seizure medication as defined by the neurology consult service. He will also be monitored for any signs of delirium tremens, seizures, or other complications of EtOH withdrawal.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Delirium tremens: A potentially life-threatening condition characterized by hallucinations, confusion, and agitation.
2. Seizures: A potential complication of EtOH withdrawal, particularly in patients with a history of seizure disorder.
3. Infections: The patient's immunocompromised state due to EtOH withdrawal and potential bacteremia or sepsis.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to EtOH withdrawal, particularly if he experiences respiratory depression.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac status may be compromised due to EtOH withdrawal, particularly if he experiences cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal tract may be compromised due to EtOH withdrawal, particularly if he experiences gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels may drop due to EtOH withdrawal, particularly if he is not receiving adequate nutrition and hydration.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but he requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications of EtOH withdrawal."
