 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Assessment and Plan: 60 year old female with a history of hepatitis C
   cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who is transferred from
   [**Hospital 1241**] hospital for management of recurrent variceal bleeding.
   Variceal Bleeding:  [**Last Name (un) 466**] out.  Hct slowly trending down.  No
   changes for now.  Access is 12 F triple lumen.  Q8hr hematocrits today.
   Patient now with two episodes of variceal bleeding within a two week
   period.  Over the past 24 hours she has required five units of packed
   red blood cells.  She is currently hemodynamically stable and her
   hematocrit is 37.3.  Her bleeding is complicated by mild acute renal
   failure with a creatinine of 1.5.  Upper endoscopy on [**2187-11-9**] showed
   multiple cords of grade 3 varices and significant portal hypertensive
   gastropathy.  Endoscopy today showed active variceal bleeding and
   intervention was unsucessful.  She currently has [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] tube in
   place.
   - appreciate liver consult
   - maintain active type and screen
   - 12 F triple lumen in place in right IJ
   - will remove PICC and left subclavian line
   - 6 units of PRBCs crossmatched
   - she is now s/p TIPS procedure for management of her portal
   hypertension as well as 7 liter paracentesis
   - will continue octreotide drip
   - continue pantoprazole drip
   - will give albumin 50 grams given large volume paracentesis
   - vancomycin and ceftazidime for SBP prophylaxis/coverage given fever
   this morning
   - Q4H hematocrit, platelet count, INR tonight
   Respiratory Failure:  Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**]
   with difficulty weaning secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.
   The etiology of her respiratory failure is unclear but was initially
   felt to be secondary to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes
   of blood.  Her respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant
   ascites and small lung volumes.  Although her initial xray is a poor
   quality film, she does appear to have volume loss on the right side
   which may also be contributing.  This repeat episode of bleeding
   occurred immediately prior to planned tracheostomy.  Per notes she has
   had a previous episode of respiratory failure in the setting of being
   found unresponsive on [**2187-10-23**].  ABG now improved with large volume
   parcentesis.
   - continue assist control ventilation for now in the setting of acute
   variceal bleeding
   - will repeat ABG now and attempt to decrease FiO2
   - will increase respiratory rate for mild hypercarbia on ABG
   - propofol for sedation
   Fevers:  GPC in clusters and pairs.  Continue vanc and ceftaz.  Febrile
   again this morning.  cultures drawn.
   Patient was reportedly febrile to 101 degrees this morning at
   [**Hospital1 1241**]  She was ordered for vancomycin and ceftazidime but did not
   receive these medications.  Cultures during her OSH course appear to
   have been negative with the exception of a sputum positive for
   stenotrophomonas and a rectal swab positive for VRE.  This appears to
   be an isolated fever.
   - blood and urine cultures pending from here
   - will follow up cultures from [**Hospital1 1241**]
   - will need to consider diagnostic paracentesis in the AM
   - will send stool for c. diff
   - will send sputum cultures
   - broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and ceftazidime
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at 1.5 from baseline of 1.1 prior to
   this hospitalization.  Elevation is in the setting of acute GI
   bleeding.
   - IV hydration targeted towards urine ouptut, MAP > 65
   - will send urine electrolytes
   - will give albumin 50 grams now given large volume paracentesis and
   renal failure
   - will consider renal consult if worsening
   Hyperkalemia:  Occuring in the setting of renal failure and also
   receiving multiple blood products.  It is now trending down.
   - will hold on kaexylate for now but consider if potassium is riding
   Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease:  Secondary to hepatitis C and
   alcohol abuse.  Current MELD score is 21.  She has recurrent variceal
   bleeding.  The remainder of her history is unclear.
   - treatment of variceal bleeding as above
   - vancomycin and ceftazidime for empiric coverage of fevers, cultures
   pending
   - consider paracentesis in the AM
   - octreotide and pantoprazole drips for variceal bleeding
   - albumin 50 grams given large volume paracentesis
   - will need to remove [**Last Name (un) **] tube in the morning
   - as above, now s/p TIPS
   - holding lactulose given [**Last Name (un) **] in place
   Type II Diabetes:  Per notes has been requiring significant doses of
   insulin in her TPN as well as slidign scale. Given critical illness
   will use insulin drip for now.
   - insulin drip
   - calculate insulin needs over 24 hours
   Elevated troponin:  Troponin 0.10 in the setting of acute renal failure
   with flat CKs.  Unlikely to represent acute coronary syndrome given
   normal CKs.
   - EKG on arrival to the MICU
   - not a candidate for aspirin, plavix, heparin, beta blocker or statin
   in current medical condition
   - will trend cardiac enzymes
   FEN: Albumin 50 grams post paracentesis, replete electrolytes, NPO
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   ascites and small lung volumes.  Although her initial xray is a poor
   quality film, she does appear to have volume loss on the right side
   which may also be contributing.  This repeat episode of bleeding
   occurred immediately prior to planned tracheostomy.  Per notes she has
   had a previous episode of respiratory failure in the setting of being
   found unresponsive on [**2187-10-23**].  ABG now improved with large volume

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who was transferred to the ICU for management of recurrent variceal bleeding. She has had two episodes of variceal bleeding within a two-week period, requiring five units of packed red blood cells. Her bleeding is complicated by mild acute renal failure with a creatinine of 1.5. She has also developed a fever, and cultures have grown gram-positive cocci in clusters and pairs. She has been treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime for suspected bacteremia.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements. She has a history of respiratory failure in the past and has required multiple units of packed red blood cells. Her cardiac enzymes are elevated, but it is unlikely to represent acute coronary syndrome given normal CKs.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin, creatinine, and potassium levels. She has a MELD score of 21, indicating end-stage liver disease. She is also at risk for hyperkalemia due to renal failure and receiving multiple blood products.

Plan:

* Continue to manage variceal bleeding with octreotide and pantoprazole drips
* Continue to monitor and treat bacteremia with vancomycin and ceftazidime
* Continue to monitor and treat acute renal failure with IV hydration and albumin
* Continue to monitor and treat hyperkalemia with potassium supplements
* Consider paracentesis to manage ascites
* Consider renal consult if worsening renal failure
* Consider liver consult for management of cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease
* Continue to monitor and treat respiratory failure with assist control ventilation and sedation
* Continue to monitor and treat fevers with broad-spectrum antibiotics
* Continue to monitor and treat hyperkalemia with potassium supplements

Potential Medical Complications:

* Bacteremia: Continued treatment with vancomycin and ceftazidime is necessary to prevent further sepsis and organ dysfunction.
* Acute Renal Failure: Continued IV hydration and albumin administration may help to improve renal function. A renal consult may be necessary if worsening renal failure occurs.
* Hyperkalemia: Continued monitoring and treatment with potassium supplements may help to prevent further hyperkalemia.
* Respiratory Failure: Continued assist control ventilation and sedation may help to improve respiratory function. A respiratory consult may be necessary if further respiratory deterioration occurs.
* Cirrhosis/End-Stage Liver Disease: Continued management of variceal bleeding and ascites may help to improve liver function. A liver consult may be necessary for further management of cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease.
* Type II Diabetes: Continued management with insulin drip may help to improve glycemic control. A diabetes consult may be necessary if further management is needed."

   Assessment and Plan: 60 year old female with a history of hepatitis C
   cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who is transferred from
   [**Hospital 1241**] hospital for management of recurrent variceal bleeding.
   Variceal Bleeding:  s/p TIPS procedure.  [**Last Name (un) 466**] removed yesterday by
   radiology.  While her Hct is slowly trending down there are no signs of
   acute bleed.  No changes for now.  Access is 12 F triple lumen.
   - appreciate liver consult
   - maintain active type and screen
   - 12 F triple lumen in place in right IJ
   - Q8hr hematocrits today.
   - pantoprazole to 40mg IV BID
   - continue octreotide drip.
   Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease:  Secondary to hepatitis C and
   alcohol abuse.  She is now off of sedation and remains significantly
   altered likely from encephalopathy.  Ideally we need to be able to give
   PO lactulose and rifaximin.  We will attempt a dobhoff placement
   today.  Current MELD score is 21.  She has recurrent variceal
   bleeding.  The remainder of her history is unclear at this time.  Per
   secretary at hepatology office, she was on the transplant list, but we
   need further clarification.
   - liver team following.  Will discuss dobhoff placement with them.
   - treatment of variceal bleeding as above
   - vancomycin for bacteremia.
   - octreotide drip and pantoprazole IV for variceal bleeding
   - currently given lactulose PR, will give PO after dobhoff placement.
   Respiratory Failure:  CXR has worsening patchy infiltrates today.
   Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**] with difficulty weaning
   secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.  The etiology of her
   respiratory failure is unclear but was initially felt to be secondary
   to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes of blood.  Her
   respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant ascites and
   small lung volumes.
   - continue assist control ventilation for now given difficult
   oxygenation.
   - propofol for sedation
   - no indication for trach at this time, especially as she has difficult
   access.
   Fevers:  Cultures grew GPC in clusters and pairs here on [**2-19**] bottles.
   At OSH grew what appears to be staph aureus on [**3-21**] bottles with
   sensitivities pending.  Has been on vancomycin and ceftazidime.
   Febrile again this morning when cultures were drawn.  Given that we
   have found a probable source of fevers, we will continue vancomycin and
   narrow to ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis.
   - ID consult given positive culture.
   - Has already had ECHO while bacteremic without signs of vegetations.
   - Continue vancomycin.  If MSSA can change to nafcillin.
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at 1.5 from baseline of 1.1 prior to
   this hospitalization.  FENa consistent with prerenal etiology and Cr
   has continued very slightly.  Urine output has been good.
   - Monitor bladder pressures to prevent peritoneal pressures obstructing
   renal perfusion.
   - Fluid repletion should happen via feeds.  We will try to place a
   dobhoff today to allow for POs.
   Type II Diabetes:  Had been on an insulin gtt at the outside hospital.
   Today we will try to convert to long-acting insulin and sliding scale.
   - calculate insulin needs over last 24 hours, convert half to
   long-acting and give half by standing doses Q6hrs.
   Elevated troponin:  Troponin 0.10 in the setting of acute renal failure
   with flat CKs.  Unlikely to represent acute coronary syndrome given
   normal CKs.  EKG did not show signs of ischemia.
   - not a candidate for aspirin, plavix, heparin, beta blocker or statin
   in current medical condition
   - will trend cardiac enzymes
   FEN: Albumin 50 grams post paracentesis, replete electrolytes, NPO
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   Access: Right IJ.  Left arterial line pulled by patient this morning.
   Will replace as patient needs frequent ABGs and blood pressure

If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan: 60 year old female with a history of hepatitis C
   cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who is transferred from
   [**Hospital 1241**] hospital for management of recurrent variceal bleeding.
   Variceal Bleeding:  s/p TIPS procedure.  [**Last Name (un) 466**] removed yesterday by
   radiology.  While her Hct is slowly trending down there are no signs of
   acute bleed.  No changes for now.  Access is 12 F triple lumen.
   - appreciate liver consult
   - maintain active type and screen
   - 12 F triple lumen in place in right IJ
   - Q8hr hematocrits today.
   - pantoprazole to 40mg IV BID
   - continue octreotide drip.
   Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease:  Secondary to hepatitis C and
   alcohol abuse.  She is now off of sedation and remains significantly
   altered likely from encephalopathy.  Ideally we need to be able to give
   PO lactulose and rifaximin.  We will attempt a dobhoff placement
   today.  Current MELD score is 21.  She has recurrent variceal
   bleeding.  The remainder of her history is unclear at this time.  Per
   secretary at hepatology office, she was on the transplant list, but we
   need further clarification.
   - liver team following.  Will discuss dobhoff placement with them.
   - treatment of variceal bleeding as above
   - vancomycin for bacteremia.
   - octreotide drip and pantoprazole IV for variceal bleeding
   - currently given lactulose PR, will give PO after dobhoff placement.
   Respiratory Failure:  CXR has worsening patchy infiltrates today.
   Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**] with difficulty weaning
   secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.  The etiology of her
   respiratory failure is unclear but was initially felt to be secondary
   to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes of blood.  Her
   respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant ascites and
   small lung volumes.
   - continue assist control ventilation for now given difficult
   oxygenation.
   - propofol for sedation
   - no indication for trach at this time, especially as she has difficult
   access.
   Fevers:  Cultures grew GPC in clusters and pairs here on [**2-19**] bottles.
   At OSH grew what appears to be staph aureus on [**3-21**] bottles with
   sensitivities pending.  Has been on vancomycin and ceftazidime.
   Febrile again this morning when cultures were drawn.  Given that we
   have found a probable source of fevers, we will continue vancomycin and
   narrow to ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis.
   - ID consult given positive culture.
   - Has already had ECHO while bacteremic without signs of vegetations.
   - Continue vancomycin.  If MSSA can change to nafcillin.
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at 1.5 from baseline of 1.1 prior to
   this hospitalization.  FENa consistent with prerenal etiology and Cr
   has continued very slightly.  Urine output has been good.
   - Monitor bladder pressures to prevent peritoneal pressures obstructing
   renal perfusion.
   - Fluid repletion should happen via feeds.  We will try to place a
   dobhoff today to allow for POs.
   Type II Diabetes:  Had been on an insulin gtt at the outside hospital.
   Today we will try to convert to long-acting insulin and sliding scale.
   - calculate insulin needs over last 24 hours, convert half to
   long-acting and give half by standing doses Q6hrs.
   Elevated troponin:  Troponin 0.10 in the setting of acute renal failure
   with flat CKs.  Unlikely to represent acute coronary syndrome given
   normal CKs.  EKG did not show signs of ischemia.
   - not a candidate for aspirin, plavix, heparin, beta blocker or statin
   in current medical condition
   - will trend cardiac enzymes
   FEN: Albumin 50 grams post paracentesis, replete electrolytes, NPO
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   Access: Right IJ.  Left arterial line pulled by patient this morning.
   Will replace as patient needs frequent ABGs and blood pressure
   monitoring.
   Code:  Full (discussed with  HCP)
   Communication: Brother [**Name (NI) 1309**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (3) 9128**]-327.  He

   Assessment and Plan: 60 year old female with a history of hepatitis C
   cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who is transferred from
   [**Hospital 1241**] hospital for management of recurrent variceal bleeding.
   Variceal Bleeding:  s/p TIPS procedure.  [**Last Name (un) 466**] removed already.
   While her Hct is slowly trending down there are no signs of acute
   bleed.  No changes for now.  Access is 12 F triple lumen.
   - Plan is to transfer her to [**Hospital1 1910**] where she is known to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 9171**] and
   she was being worked up for transplant
   - appreciate liver consult
 will f/u their recs
   - maintain active type and screen, rescreen today
   - has 7U PRBC's crossmatched. Will need to cancel them for today
   - 12 F triple lumen in place in right IJ
   - Q8hr hematocrits today.
   - pantoprazole to 40mg IV BID
   - continue octreotide drip.
   Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease:  Secondary to hepatitis C and
   alcohol abuse.  She is now off of sedation and remains significantly
   altered likely from encephalopathy.  Getting lactulose and rifaxamin by
   Dobhoff.  Current MELD score is 21.
   - treatment of variceal bleeding as above
   - now getting PO Rifaxamin and Lactulose
   - Vancomycin for bacteremia.
   - octreotide drip and pantoprazole IV for variceal bleeding
   Respiratory Failure:  Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**]
   with difficulty weaning secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.
   The etiology of her respiratory failure is unclear but was initially
   felt to be secondary to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes
   of blood.  Her respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant
   ascites and small lung volumes.
   - Wean PEEP today from 18 to 15
   - Watch O2 sats
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need trach but will try to wean to better PEEPs
    Fevers:  Cultures grew GPC in clusters and pairs here on [**2-19**] bottles.
   At OSH grew what appears to be staph aureus on [**3-21**] bottles with
   sensitivities pending.  Has been on vancomycin and ceftazidime but
   switched to Vanc and Ceftriaxone.  Febrile to 100.7 yesterday 8pm.
   - ID consult given positive culture.
   - Has already had ECHO while bacteremic without signs of vegetations.
   - Will continue Vanc and Ceftriaxone per liver recs
   - Now day 4 Vanc and day 2 Ceftriaxone
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at admission 1.5 from baseline of 1.1
   prior to this hospitalization.  FENa consistent with prerenal etiology
   and Cr has continued to trend downward.  Urine output has been good.
   - Will give 500cc's D5 this am with potassium and f/u Cr this pm
   Type II Diabetes:  Had been on an insulin gtt at the outside hospital
   and here but have now started subQ insulin.
   - Currently on Glargine 25 qhs and SSI
   - Watch BS's and adjust accordingly, have been in the 100's through
   yesterday
   -Hypernatremia: Likely from poor fluid intake as she is negative 2.6
   through LOS and was negative through yesterday
   - Will replace K this am with 500cc D5W
   - Start free H20 flushes through feeding tube
   - repeat lytes this pm and f/u
   FEN: Albumin 50 grams post paracentesis, replete electrolytes, has now
   started tube feeds through Dobhoff

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - From [**Hospital1 1910**] (liver): Patient was listed for transplant at [**Hospital1 1910**],
   actually active on the transplant list as they had not heard of her
   most recent hospitalization, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 9171**] believes that they would like
   her back to transplant her. They will call when an ICU bed is
   available...
   - Had frothy fluid from ETT, suctioned, O2 sats in low 90s, PEEP of 18,
   given Lasix 20mg, 20mg, CXR with pulm edema

She has a TIPS procedure and is being worked up for liver transplant. She is currently intubated due to respiratory failure and has a history of acute kidney injury.

The patient's recent events include:

* Arterial line placement
* Changes to her antibiotic regimen
* Placement of a 12F triple lumen catheter in her right IJ
* Administration of octreotide drip and pantoprazole IV for variceal bleeding
* Weaning of PEEP from 18 to 15
* Switch to subQ insulin for type II diabetes
* Replacement of potassium and fluid therapy for hypernatremia

Medical Complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated for several days and is experiencing difficulty weaning due to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine has increased from 1.1 to 1.5, and she has been diagnosed with acute kidney injury.
* Bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture and is being treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
* Delirium: The patient is significantly altered and has a history of encephalopathy.
* Hypernatremia: The patient has a negative fluid balance and is at risk for hypernatremia.
* Acute liver failure: The patient has a MELD score of 21 and is being worked up for liver transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Further respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may continue to deteriorate, and she may require further intervention.
* Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia may lead to sepsis, which could worsen her respiratory and renal function.
* Liver failure: The patient's liver function may continue to deteriorate, leading to further complications.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of variceal bleeding and may experience further bleeding episodes.
* Infection: The patient's bacteremia and respiratory failure may lead to further infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Assessment and Plan: 60 year old female with a history of hepatitis C
   cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who is transferred from
   [**Hospital 1241**] hospital for management of recurrent variceal bleeding.
   Variceal Bleeding:  s/p TIPS procedure.  [**Last Name (un) 466**] removed yesterday by
   radiology.  While her Hct is slowly trending down there are no signs of
   acute bleed.  No changes for now.  Access is 12 F triple lumen.
   - Plan is to transfer her to [**Hospital1 1910**] where she is known to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 9171**] and
   she was being worked up for transplant
   - appreciate liver consult
   - maintain active type and screen, rescreen today
   - has 7U PRBC's crossmatched. Will need to cancel them for today
   - 12 F triple lumen in place in right IJ
   - Q8hr hematocrits today.
   - pantoprazole to 40mg IV BID
   - continue octreotide drip.
   Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease:  Secondary to hepatitis C and
   alcohol abuse.  She is now off of sedation and remains significantly
   altered likely from encephalopathy.  Ideally we need to be able to give
   PO lactulose and rifaximin.  We will attempt a dobhoff placement
   today.  Current MELD score is 21.  She has recurrent variceal
   bleeding.  The remainder of her history is unclear at this time.  Per
   secretary at hepatology office, she was on the transplant list, but we
   need further clarification.
   - liver team following.  Will discuss dobhoff placement with them.
   - treatment of variceal bleeding as above
   - now getting PO Rifaxamin and Lactulose
   - vancomycin for bacteremia.
   - octreotide drip and pantoprazole IV for variceal bleeding
   Respiratory Failure:  CXR has worsening patchy infiltrates today.
   Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**] with difficulty weaning
   secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.  The etiology of her
   respiratory failure is unclear but was initially felt to be secondary
   to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes of blood.  Her
   respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant ascites and
   small lung volumes.
   - continue assist control ventilation for now given difficult
   oxygenation, will try a spontaneous breath trial today
   - Will need new tube as there appears to be a cuff leak
   - now off sedation
   - no indication for trach at this time, especially as she has difficult
   access.
   Pulm edema: seen on CXR with frothy liquid coming from ETT
   - keep negative for today: will give 20mg Lasix today and monitor UOP
    Fevers:  Cultures grew GPC in clusters and pairs here on [**2-19**] bottles.
   At OSH grew what appears to be staph aureus on [**3-21**] bottles with
   sensitivities pending.  Has been on vancomycin and ceftazidime but
   switched to Vanc and Ceftriaxone.  Febrile to 100.7 yesterday 8pm.
   - ID consult given positive culture.
   - Has already had ECHO while bacteremic without signs of vegetations.
   - Will continue Vanc and Ceftriaxone per liver recs
   - Now day 4 Vanc and day 2 Ceftriaxone
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at admission 1.5 from baseline of 1.1
   prior to this hospitalization.  FENa consistent with prerenal etiology
   and Cr has continued to trend downward.  Urine output has been good.
   - Monitor bladder pressures to prevent peritoneal pressures obstructing
   renal perfusion.
   - Fluid repletion should happen via feeds.  We will try to place a
   dobhoff today to allow for POs.
   - Will give 500cc's D5 this am with potassium and f/u Cr this pm
   Type II Diabetes:  Had been on an insulin gtt at the outside hospital
   and here but have now started subQ insulin.
   - Currently on Glargine 25 qhs and SSI
   - Watch BS's and adjust accordingly, have been in the 100's through
   yesterday
   -Hypernatremia: Likely from poor fluid intake as she is negative 2.6
   through LOS and was negative through yesterday
   - Will replace K this am with 500cc D5W
   - repeat lytes this pm and f/u
   FEN: Albumin 50 grams post paracentesis, replete electrolytes, has now
   started tube feeds through Dobhoff
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   Access: Right IJ. R art line.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan: 60 year old female with a history of hepatitis C
   cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who is transferred from
   [**Hospital 1241**] hospital for management of recurrent variceal bleeding.
   Variceal Bleeding:  s/p TIPS procedure.  [**Last Name (un) 466**] removed yesterday by
   radiology.  While her Hct is slowly trending down there are no signs of
   acute bleed.  No changes for now.  Access is 12 F triple lumen.
   - Plan is to transfer her to [**Hospital1 1910**] where she is known to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 9171**] and
   she was being worked up for transplant
   - appreciate liver consult
   - maintain active type and screen, rescreen today
   - has 7U PRBC's crossmatched. Will need to cancel them for today
   - 12 F triple lumen in place in right IJ
   - Q8hr hematocrits today.
   - pantoprazole to 40mg IV BID
   - continue octreotide drip.
   Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease:  Secondary to hepatitis C and
   alcohol abuse.  She is now off of sedation and remains significantly
   altered likely from encephalopathy.  Ideally we need to be able to give
   PO lactulose and rifaximin.  We will attempt a dobhoff placement
   today.  Current MELD score is 21.  She has recurrent variceal
   bleeding.  The remainder of her history is unclear at this time.  Per
   secretary at hepatology office, she was on the transplant list, but we
   need further clarification.
   - liver team following.  Will discuss dobhoff placement with them.
   - treatment of variceal bleeding as above
   - now getting PO Rifaxamin and Lactulose
   - vancomycin for bacteremia.
   - octreotide drip and pantoprazole IV for variceal bleeding
   Respiratory Failure:  CXR has worsening patchy infiltrates today.
   Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**] with difficulty weaning
   secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.  The etiology of her
   respiratory failure is unclear but was initially felt to be secondary
   to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes of blood.  Her
   respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant ascites and
   small lung volumes.
   - continue assist control ventilation for now given difficult
   oxygenation, will try a spontaneous breath trial today
   - Will need new tube as there appears to be a cuff leak
   - now off sedation
   - no indication for trach at this time, especially as she has difficult
   access.
   Pulm edema: seen on CXR with frothy liquid coming from ETT
   - keep negative for today: will give 20mg Lasix today and monitor UOP
    Fevers:  Cultures grew GPC in clusters and pairs here on [**2-19**] bottles.
   At OSH grew what appears to be staph aureus on [**3-21**] bottles with
   sensitivities pending.  Has been on vancomycin and ceftazidime but
   switched to Vanc and Ceftriaxone.  Febrile to 100.7 yesterday 8pm.
   - ID consult given positive culture.
   - Has already had ECHO while bacteremic without signs of vegetations.
   - Will continue Vanc and Ceftriaxone per liver recs
   - Now day 4 Vanc and day 2 Ceftriaxone
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at admission 1.5 from baseline of 1.1
   prior to this hospitalization.  FENa consistent with prerenal etiology
   and Cr has continued to trend downward.  Urine output has been good.
   - Monitor bladder pressures to prevent peritoneal pressures obstructing
   renal perfusion.
   - Fluid repletion should happen via feeds.  We will try to place a
   dobhoff today to allow for POs.
   - Will give 500cc's D5 this am with potassium and f/u Cr this pm
   Type II Diabetes:  Had been on an insulin gtt at the outside hospital
   and here but have now started subQ insulin.
   - Currently on Glargine 25 qhs and SSI
   - Watch BS's and adjust accordingly, have been in the 100's through
   yesterday
   -Hypernatremia: Likely from poor fluid intake as she is negative 2.6
   through LOS and was negative through yesterday
   - Will replace K this am with 500cc D5W
   - repeat lytes this pm and f/u
   FEN: Albumin 50 grams post paracentesis, replete electrolytes, has now
   started tube feeds through Dobhoff

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse, who was transferred to the ICU for management of recurrent variceal bleeding. She has undergone a TIPS procedure and has a 12F triple lumen catheter in her right internal jugular vein.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: She is intubated and on assist control ventilation due to respiratory failure, with a CXR showing worsening patchy infiltrates. She has a cuff leak and is requiring high PEEP and FiO2 levels.
* Cardiovascular: Her blood pressure is 125/52 mmHg, and her central venous pressure (CVP) is 10 mmHg.
* Neurological: She is significantly altered and likely has encephalopathy, with no signs of increased intracranial pressure.
* Gastrointestinal: She has cirrhosis and is at risk for bleeding, with a current MELD score of 21.
* Renal: Her creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL, and she has been experiencing acute renal failure. Her urine output is good, and she is receiving fluid repletion via feeds.
* Endocrine: She has type II diabetes and is receiving subQ insulin.
* Hematological: Her hemoglobin is 9.4 g/dL, and her platelet count is 101 x 10^9/L.
* Infection: She has bacteremia, with cultures growing GPC and staph aureus. She is receiving vancomycin and ceftriaxone.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she is not weaned off the ventilator or if her underlying condition does not improve.
* Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia may lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly and effectively.
* Liver failure: The patient's cirrhosis and encephalopathy may progress to liver failure, which can be fatal if not treated with a liver transplant.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if she does not receive adequate fluid repletion and management of her underlying condition.
* Diabetes complications: The patient's type II diabetes may lead to complications such as hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, or diabetic nephropathy if not managed effectively.
* Bleeding: The patient's cirrhosis and variceal bleeding may lead to further bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding or hemorrhage.

To prevent or manage these complications, the patient should be closely monitored and receive appropriate medical treatment, including antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals as needed. She should also receive supportive care, including fluid repletion, nutritional support, and management of her underlying conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   #Variceal Bleeding:  s/p TIPS procedure.  [**Last Name (un) 466**] removed. HCT
   stable.  No changes for now.  Access is 12 F triple lumen.
   - Plan is to transfer her to [**Hospital1 1910**] where she is known to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 9171**] and
   she was being worked up for transplant
   - appreciate liver consult
 will f/u their recs
   - maintain active type and screen,
   - 12 F triple lumen in place in right IJ
   - Q8hr hematocrits today.
   - pantoprazole to 40mg IV BID
   - continue octreotide drip.
   #Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease:  Secondary to hepatitis C, alcohol
   abuse and NASH.  HCV viral load 12,500 . She is now off of sedation and
   remains significantly altered likely from encephalopathy.  Getting
   lactulose and rifaxamin by Dobhoff.  Current MELD score is 16. ALT and
   AST trending upward. Alk phos also acutely elevated. [**Month (only) 11**] be cholestasis
   secondary to NPO given patient was NPO for sig time.
   - treatment of variceal bleeding as above
   - now getting PO Rifaxamin and Lactulose
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**]
   with difficulty weaning secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.
   The etiology of her respiratory failure is unclear but was initially
   felt to be secondary to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes
   of blood.  Her respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant
   ascites and small lung volumes.
   -PEEP currently at 12, tolerating well, will try to wean to 10 today.
   - Watch O2 sats
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need trach but will try to wean to better PEEPs
   # Fevers:  Cultures grew GPC in clusters and pairs here on [**2-19**]
   bottles.  At OSH grew Staph Epidermis 3/4 bottles with sensitivity only
   to vancomycin.  Has been on vancomycin and ceftazidime but switched to
   Vanc and Ceftriaxone.
   - ID consult given positive culture.
   - Has already had ECHO while bacteremic without signs of vegetations.
   - Will continue Vanc and Ceftriaxone per liver recs
   - Now day 5 Vanc and day 3 Ceftriaxone
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at admission 1.5 from baseline of 1.1
   prior to this hospitalization.  FENa consistent with prerenal etiology
   and Cr has continued to trend downward.  Urine output has been good.
   #Type II Diabetes:  Had been on an insulin gtt at the outside hospital
   and here but have now started subQ insulin. Blood sugars in 200s.
   - Currently on Glargine 30 qhs and SSI
   - Increase glargine to 38 qhs.
   -Hypernatremia: Likely from poor fluid intake as she is negative 2.3
   through LOS. Improving with free water flushes.
   -Continue free water flushes 250ml q4 hours
   - repeat lytes this pm and f/u
   #Thrombocytopenia: Patient continues to trend down. Per notes from OSH,
   patient appears to usually be around 100.
   -Continue to monitor
   #FEN: Albumin 50 grams post paracentesis, replete electrolytes, has now
   started tube feeds through Dobhoff

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital for management of recurrent variceal bleeding. She has undergone a TIPS procedure and has a triple lumen catheter in her right internal jugular vein. She is intubated and has been on mechanical ventilation since November 9th due to respiratory failure, which is unclear in etiology. She has a high PEEP and FiO2 requirement, and her respiratory mechanics are affected by ascites and small lung volumes.

The patient has a variety of medical complications, including:

1. Bacteremia: Cultures grew GPC in clusters and pairs, and she has been treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
2. Acute Renal Failure: Her creatinine has trended downward, and urine output has been good.
3. Type II Diabetes: She has been on insulin therapy, and her blood sugars have been in the 200s.
4. Hypernatremia: She has been treated with free water flushes to improve her sodium levels.
5. Thrombocytopenia: Her platelet count has trended down, and she has been monitored closely.
6. FEN (Fluid, Electrolyte, and Nutritional) imbalance: She has been repleted with electrolytes and has started tube feeds through a Dobhoff tube.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and positive cultures may lead to sepsis, which can cause organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's high PEEP and FiO2 requirement may lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis and liver disease may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause confusion, disorientation, and even coma.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure, which can require dialysis.
5. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and positive cultures may lead to infection, which can cause sepsis and organ dysfunction.
6. Bleeding: The patient's liver disease and thrombocytopenia may lead to bleeding, which can be life-threatening.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's bacteremia and adjust treatment as necessary.
2. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with PEEP and FiO2 adjustments.
3. Monitor the patient's liver function and adjust treatment as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's blood sugars and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Continue to provide supportive care, including nutrition and hydration, to the patient."

   Assessment and Plan: 60 year old female with a history of hepatitis C
   cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who is transferred from
   [**Hospital 1241**] hospital for management of recurrent variceal bleeding.
   #Variceal Bleeding:  s/p TIPS procedure.  [**Last Name (un) 466**] removed. HCT
   stable.  No changes for now.  Access is 12 F triple lumen.
   - Plan is to transfer her to [**Hospital1 1910**] where she is known to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 9171**] and
   she was being worked up for transplant
   - appreciate liver consult
 will f/u their recs
   - maintain active type and screen,
   - 12 F triple lumen in place in right IJ
   - [**Hospital1 **] HCT
   - pantoprazole to 40mg IV BID
   - d/c octreotide drip per liver recs
   #Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease:  Secondary to hepatitis C, alcohol
   abuse and NASH.  HCV viral load 12,500 . She is now off of sedation and
   remains significantly altered likely from encephalopathy.  Getting
   lactulose and rifaxamin by Dobhoff.  Current MELD score is 16. ALT and
   AST trending upward. Alk phos also acutely elevated. [**Month (only) 11**] be cholestasis
   secondary to NPO given patient was NPO for sig time.
   - treatment of variceal bleeding as above
   - now getting PO Rifaxamin and Lactulose
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**]
   with difficulty weaning secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.
   The etiology of her respiratory failure is unclear but was initially
   felt to be secondary to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes
   of blood.  Her respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant
   ascites and small lung volumes.
   -PEEP currently at 12, tolerating well, will try to wean today as
   tolerated
   - Watch O2 sats
   - ABG to assess weaning
   # Fevers:  Cultures grew GPC in clusters and pairs here on [**2-19**]
   bottles.  At OSH grew Staph Epidermis 3/4 bottles with sensitivity only
   to vancomycin.  Has been on vancomycin and ceftazidime but switched to
   Vanc and Ceftriaxone.
   - Has already had ECHO while bacteremic without signs of vegetations.
   - Will continue Vanc and Ceftriaxone per liver recs
   - Now day 5 Vanc and day 3 Ceftriaxone
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at admission 1.5 from baseline of 1.1
   prior to this hospitalization.  FENa consistent with prerenal etiology
   and Cr has continued to trend downward.  Urine output has been good.
   #Type II Diabetes:  Had been on an insulin gtt at the outside hospital
   and here but have now started subQ insulin. Blood sugars in 200s.
   - Currently on Glargine 30 qhs and SSI
   - Increase glargine to 50qhs
   -Hypernatremia: Likely from poor fluid intake as she is negative 2.3
   through LOS. Improving with free water flushes.
   -Continue free water flushes 250ml q4 hours
   - repeat electrolytes this pm and f/u
   #Thrombocytopenia: Patient continues to trend down. Per notes from OSH,
   patient appears to usually be around 100.
   -Continue to monitor
   #FEN: Albumin 50 grams post paracentesis, replete electrolytes, has now
   started tube feeds through Dobhoff
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   Access: Right IJ. R art line.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan: 60 year old female with a history of hepatitis C
   cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who is transferred from
   [**Hospital 1241**] hospital for management of recurrent variceal bleeding.
   #Variceal Bleeding:  s/p TIPS procedure.  [**Last Name (un) 466**] removed. HCT
   stable.  No changes for now.  Access is 12 F triple lumen.
   - Plan is to transfer her to [**Hospital1 1910**] where she is known to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 9171**] and
   she was being worked up for transplant
   - appreciate liver consult
 will f/u their recs
   - maintain active type and screen,
   - 12 F triple lumen in place in right IJ
   - [**Hospital1 **] HCT
   - pantoprazole to 40mg IV BID
   - d/c octreotide drip per liver recs
   #Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease:  Secondary to hepatitis C, alcohol
   abuse and NASH.  HCV viral load 12,500 . She is now off of sedation and
   remains significantly altered likely from encephalopathy.  Getting
   lactulose and rifaxamin by Dobhoff.  Current MELD score is 16. ALT and
   AST trending upward. Alk phos also acutely elevated. [**Month (only) 11**] be cholestasis
   secondary to NPO given patient was NPO for sig time.
   - treatment of variceal bleeding as above
   - now getting PO Rifaxamin and Lactulose
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**]
   with difficulty weaning secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.
   The etiology of her respiratory failure is unclear but was initially
   felt to be secondary to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes
   of blood.  Her respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant
   ascites and small lung volumes.
   -PEEP currently at 12, tolerating well, will try to wean today as
   tolerated
   - Watch O2 sats
   - ABG to assess weaning
   # Fevers:  Cultures grew GPC in clusters and pairs here on [**2-19**]
   bottles.  At OSH grew Staph Epidermis 3/4 bottles with sensitivity only
   to vancomycin.  Has been on vancomycin and ceftazidime but switched to
   Vanc and Ceftriaxone.
   - Has already had ECHO while bacteremic without signs of vegetations.
   - Will continue Vanc and Ceftriaxone per liver recs
   - Now day 5 Vanc and day 3 Ceftriaxone
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at admission 1.5 from baseline of 1.1
   prior to this hospitalization.  FENa consistent with prerenal etiology
   and Cr has continued to trend downward.  Urine output has been good.
   #Type II Diabetes:  Had been on an insulin gtt at the outside hospital
   and here but have now started subQ insulin. Blood sugars in 200s.
   - Currently on Glargine 30 qhs and SSI
   - Increase glargine to 50qhs
   -Hypernatremia: Likely from poor fluid intake as she is negative 2.3
   through LOS. Improving with free water flushes.
   -Continue free water flushes 250ml q4 hours
   - repeat electrolytes this pm and f/u
   #Thrombocytopenia: Patient continues to trend down. Per notes from OSH,
   patient appears to usually be around 100.
   -Continue to monitor
   #FEN: Albumin 50 grams post paracentesis, replete electrolytes, has now
   started tube feeds through Dobhoff
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   Access: Right IJ. R art line.
   Code:  Full (discussed with  HCP)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - d/c octreotide drip per liver recs
   #Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease:  Secondary to hepatitis C, alcohol
   abuse and NASH.  HCV viral load 12,500 . She is now off of sedation and
   remains significantly altered likely from encephalopathy.  Getting
   lactulose and rifaxamin by Dobhoff.  Current MELD score is 16. ALT and
   AST trending upward. Alk phos also acutely elevated. [**Month (only) 11**] be cholestasis
   secondary to NPO given patient was NPO for sig time.
   - treatment of variceal bleeding as above
   - now getting PO Rifaxamin and Lactulose
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**]
   with difficulty weaning secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.
   The etiology of her respiratory failure is unclear but was initially
   felt to be secondary to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes
   of blood.  Her respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant
   ascites and small lung volumes.
   -PEEP currently at 12, tolerating well, will try to wean today as
   tolerated
   - Watch O2 sats
   - ABG to assess weaning
   # Fevers:  Cultures grew GPC in clusters and pairs here on [**2-19**]
   bottles.  At OSH grew Staph Epidermis 3/4 bottles with sensitivity only
   to vancomycin.  Has been on vancomycin and ceftazidime but switched to
   Vanc and Ceftriaxone.
   - Has already had ECHO while bacteremic without signs of vegetations.
   - Will continue Vanc and Ceftriaxone per liver recs
   - Now day 5 Vanc and day 3 Ceftriaxone
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at admission 1.5 from baseline of 1.1
   prior to this hospitalization.  FENa consistent with prerenal etiology
   and Cr has continued to trend downward.  Urine output has been good.
   #Type II Diabetes:  Had been on an insulin gtt at the outside hospital
   and here but have now started subQ insulin. Blood sugars in 200s.
   - Currently on Glargine 30 qhs and SSI
   - Increase glargine to 50qhs
   -Hypernatremia: Likely from poor fluid intake as she is negative 2.3
   through LOS. Improving with free water flushes.
   -Continue free water flushes 250ml q4 hours
   - repeat electrolytes this pm and f/u
   #Thrombocytopenia: Patient continues to trend down. Per notes from OSH,
   patient appears to usually be around 100.
   -Continue to monitor
   #FEN: Albumin 50 grams post paracentesis, replete electrolytes, has now
   started tube feeds through Dobhoff
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who was transferred to the ICU for management of recurrent variceal bleeding. She had undergone a TIPS procedure and was being worked up for liver transplant.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and has been on mechanical ventilation since November 9th. She has difficulty weaning due to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements. Her respiratory mechanics are affected by significant ascites and small lung volumes.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient's blood pressure is stable, with a heart rate of 83 beats per minute and a cardiac rhythm of sinus rhythm.
* Renal status: The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.5 from baseline. Her urine output has been good, and her FENa is consistent with a prerenal etiology.
* Hepatic status: The patient has cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease due to hepatitis C, alcohol abuse, and NASH. Her MELD score is 16, and her ALT and AST levels are trending upward.
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, and her abdominal ascites is significant.
* Hematological status: The patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 91 K/uL. Her WBC count is 8.4 K/uL, and her hemoglobin level is 8.9 g/dL.
* Nutritional status: The patient is malnourished, with a body mass index of 27.0.
* Infectious status: The patient has bacteremia, with cultures growing GPC in clusters and pairs. She has also been treated for pneumonia with vancomycin and ceftriaxone.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may require further mechanical ventilation or other respiratory support.
* Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver function is impaired, and she may develop encephalopathy, which could worsen her neurological status.
* Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia and pneumonia, which could lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition.
* Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and she may require further supportive care or dialysis.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to further complications, such as hemorrhagic shock.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which could increase her risk of bleeding.
* Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is high, which could lead to further complications, such as seizures or cardiac arrhythmias.

Based on this assessment, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, and hematological status. She also requires ongoing treatment for her bacteremia and pneumonia, as well as further evaluation and management of her liver disease."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**]
   with difficulty weaning secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.
   The etiology of her respiratory failure is unclear but was initially
   felt to be secondary to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes
   of blood.  Her respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant
   ascites and small lung volumes.
   -PEEP currently at 8, tolerating well, will try to wean today as
   tolerated
   - Watch O2 sats
   - ABG to assess weaning
   # Fevers:  Cultures grew GPC in clusters and pairs here on [**2-19**]

   to vancomycin.  Has been on vancomycin and ceftazidime but switched to
   Vanc and Ceftriaxone
   - Has already had ECHO while bacteremic without signs of vegetations.
   - Now day 6 Vanc and day 4 Ceftriaxone
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at admission 1.5 from baseline of 1.1
   prior to this hospitalization.  FENa consistent with prerenal etiology
   and Cr has continued to trend downward and is now normal.  Urine output
   has been good.
   #Type II Diabetes:  Had been on an insulin gtt at the outside hospital
   and here but have now started subQ insulin. Blood sugars in 200s.
   - Increased last night to Glargine 50 qhs
   - Continue ISS
   -Hypernatremia: Likely from poor fluid intake as she is negative 2.3
   through LOS. Improving with free water flushes.
   -Continue free water flushes 250ml q4 hours
   - repeat electrolytes this pm and f/u
   #Thrombocytopenia: Patient continues to trend down. Per notes from OSH,
   patient appears to usually be around 100.
   -Continue to monitor

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who was admitted to the ICU for management of recurrent variceal bleeding. She has undergone a TIPS procedure and is currently being treated for respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and sepsis. Her laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, hypernatremia, and thrombocytopenia. She has been intubated since November 9th and has been on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 8 cmH2O. She has also been receiving antibiotics and antifungals for suspected bacterial and fungal infections.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue, and there is a risk of further deterioration due to her underlying liver disease and ascites. Prolonged mechanical ventilation may lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia, lung injury, and muscle weakness.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen, leading to multi-organ dysfunction, particularly in her liver, kidneys, and lungs.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is already compromised, and further deterioration may lead to liver failure, which could be fatal.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease and the need for dialysis.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to bleeding complications, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may worsen, leading to central nervous system symptoms, such as headache, seizures, and coma.
7. Infection: The patient is at high risk of developing further infections, particularly in her respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
8. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may worsen, leading to hemorrhagic shock and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her mechanical ventilation settings as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and antifungals, and consider adding other antimicrobial agents if necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's liver function and consider listing her for liver transplantation if her liver function continues to deteriorate.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and consider dialysis if her creatinine levels continue to rise.
5. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider platelet transfusions if necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her fluid management accordingly.
7. Consider adding anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombotic complications.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust her insulin therapy as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-inch tall male who has been admitted to the ICU with a history of cirrhosis of the liver, diabetes mellitus type II, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been receiving various medications, including octreotide, Humalog, and antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 75 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 120/47 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 174.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.1 x 10^9/L, a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, and a platelet count of 99 x 10^9/L. The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, with an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 46 IU/L and an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 78 IU/L.

The patient's imaging studies show a large amount of ascites and a small amount of pleural effusion. The patient's microbiology results show the presence of Gram-negative rods (GNR) in the sputum, but the patient's C. difficile test is negative.

The patient's clinical status is complicated by the presence of delirium, gastrointestinal bleeding, and respiratory failure. The patient's nutritional status is altered, and the patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and altered nutritional status make them susceptible to sepsis.
2. Liver failure: The patient's cirrhosis of the liver and elevated liver enzymes increase the risk of liver failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation increase the risk of respiratory failure.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and altered nutritional status increase the risk of further bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and altered nutritional status increase the risk of infection.
6. Delirium: The patient's delirium and altered mental status increase the risk of falls and other complications.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's altered nutritional status and need for TPN increase the risk of malnutrition.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications. Close monitoring and management of the patient's conditions are necessary to prevent further complications and improve their clinical status."

   Assessment and Plan: 60 year old female with a history of hepatitis C
   cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who is transferred from
   [**Hospital 1241**] hospital for management of recurrent variceal bleeding.
   #Variceal Bleeding:  s/p TIPS procedure.  [**Last Name (un) 466**] removed. HCT
   stable.  No changes for now.  Access is 12 F triple lumen.
   - Plan is to transfer her to [**Hospital1 1910**] where she is known to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 9171**] and
   she was being worked up for transplant
   - appreciate liver consult
 octreotide gtt stopped
   - maintain active type and screen currently outdate [**2187-11-27**]
   - 12 F triple lumen in place in right IJ
   - [**Hospital1 **] HCT
   - pantoprazole to 40mg IV BID
   #Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease:  Secondary to hepatitis C, alcohol
   abuse and NASH.  HCV viral load 12,500 . She is now off of sedation and
   remains significantly altered likely from encephalopathy.  Getting
   lactulose and rifaxamin by Dobhoff.  Current MELD score is 16. ALT and
   AST now down after trending upward. Alk phos also acutely elevated. [**Month (only) 11**]
   be cholestasis secondary to NPO given patient was NPO for sig time.
   - treatment of variceal bleeding as above
   - now getting PO Rifaxamin and Lactulose
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**]
   with difficulty weaning secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.
   The etiology of her respiratory failure is unclear but was initially
   felt to be secondary to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes
   of blood.  Her respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant
   ascites and small lung volumes.
   -PEEP currently at 8, tolerating well, will try to wean today as
   tolerated
   - Watch O2 sats
   - ABG to assess weaning
   # Fevers:  Cultures grew GPC in clusters and pairs here on [**2-19**]
   bottles.  At OSH grew Staph Epidermis 3/4 bottles with sensitivity only
   to vancomycin.  Has been on vancomycin and ceftazidime but switched to
   Vanc and Ceftriaxone
   - Has already had ECHO while bacteremic without signs of vegetations.
   - Now day 6 Vanc and day 4 Ceftriaxone
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at admission 1.5 from baseline of 1.1
   prior to this hospitalization.  FENa consistent with prerenal etiology
   and Cr has continued to trend downward and is now normal.  Urine output
   has been good.
   #Type II Diabetes:  Had been on an insulin gtt at the outside hospital
   and here but have now started subQ insulin. Blood sugars in 200s.
   - Increased last night to Glargine 50 qhs
   - Continue ISS
   -Hypernatremia: Likely from poor fluid intake as she is negative 2.3
   through LOS. Improving with free water flushes.
   -Continue free water flushes 250ml q4 hours
   - repeat electrolytes this pm and f/u
   #Thrombocytopenia: Patient continues to trend down. Per notes from OSH,
   patient appears to usually be around 100.
   -Continue to monitor
   #FEN: replete electrolytes, has now started tube feeds through Dobhoff
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   Access: Right IJ. R art line.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who was transferred to the ICU for management of recurrent variceal bleeding. She has undergone a TIPS procedure and has a 12F triple lumen catheter in place in her right internal jugular vein. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 8 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. Her respiratory mechanics are affected by significant ascites and small lung volumes.

The patient has a MELD score of 16 and is being treated for liver cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. She has a history of bacteremia and has been treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime, but switched to vancomycin and ceftriaxone. She also has a history of acute renal failure, but her creatinine has trended downward and is now normal.

The patient has a number of other medical conditions, including type II diabetes, thrombocytopenia, and hypernatremia. She is being treated with insulin, lactulose, and rifaximin, and is receiving tube feeds through a Dobhoff tube.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to her underlying liver disease and ascites, but it may also be exacerbated by her intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has a history of bacteremia and may be at risk for further infections, particularly if her catheters are not properly maintained.
3. Liver failure: The patient's MELD score is 16, which indicates that she is at high risk for liver failure. She may require further treatment, such as liver transplantation, to improve her chances of survival.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine has trended downward and is now normal, but she may still be at risk for further renal damage if her blood pressure is not well-controlled.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is likely due to her poor fluid intake and may be exacerbated by her ascites. She may require further treatment, such as free water flushes, to correct this imbalance.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be due to her underlying liver disease or may be a side effect of her medications. She may require further treatment, such as platelet transfusions, to correct this imbalance.
7. Diabetes: The patient's type II diabetes may require further treatment, such as adjustments to her insulin regimen, to control her blood sugar levels.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."
