You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has been experiencing angioedema, likely caused by Ativan, which has improved significantly overnight. The patient's mental status has also cleared, and they are now awake and following commands. The patient has a history of anaphylaxis to Dilantin and has been treated with antibiotics, including Infusions of Heparin Sodium. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 113/54 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O, which may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has experienced an episode of Afib with RVR, and is currently on metoprolol, which may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving heparin infusion, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Infection: The patient has had multiple blood cultures, which may indicate the presence of an infection.
5. Neurological complications: The patient has experienced angioedema, which may indicate a neurological complication.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of nausea and vomiting, which may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications.
7. Renal complications: The patient has had dialysis catheter insertion, which may increase the risk of renal complications.
8. Sepsis: The patient has had multiple blood cultures, which may indicate the presence of sepsis.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring their vital signs, lab results, and clinical status closely to identify any potential complications early and intervene promptly."

   This is a 63 yo female with PMH of ESRD on HD s/p failed kidney
   transplant, recent ex-lap for benign pneumatosis, who presents with
   acute episode of AMS.
   .
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: The episode of decreased responsiveness is
   likely due to postictal state/medication effect (ativan, propofol).
   Her mental status now is appropriate. Head CT and tox screens were
   negative.   EEG yesterday (prelim) negative for status.   Would hold
   off on using ativan for any recurrent seizure as it may have been
   responsible for her angioedema yesterday.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) after a failed kidney transplant, who presented with acute mental status changes (AMS) and angioedema. She was found to have a seizure and was intubated. Her mental status has improved overnight, and she is now awake and following commands. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. She is currently on HD and has a central venous catheter for emergency access.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure recurrence: The patient had a seizure and was prescribed Depakote and Keppra. However, the EEG yesterday was negative, and the patient's mental status has improved. Nevertheless, the patient is at risk for seizure recurrence, and close monitoring is necessary.
2. Angioedema: The patient had angioedema, which may have been caused by the administration of Ativan. The patient will need an outpatient allergy workup, and steroids will be given to help manage the condition.
3. Hypotension: The patient had hypotension, which may have been caused by medication effects. The patient is now back on metoprolol, and fentanyl will be used for bolus sedation as needed.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient has missed two outpatient HD sessions and was dialyzed yesterday in the MICU. Daily dialysis will be continued to treat uremia.
5. Afib on coumadin: The patient has Afib on coumadin, and the INR is subtherapeutic. The patient will need to restart coumadin once extubated.
6. HTN: The patient has hypertension, and metoprolol will be continued. Lisinopril will be discontinued due to the association with angioedema.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, and a statin will be continued.
8. DM: The patient has diabetes, and RISS and FSG will be continued.
9. Access: The patient has a central venous catheter for emergency access, and obtaining central access may be difficult due to previous central venous DVT.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with altered mental status (AMS). She had a recent episode of acute respiratory failure, sepsis, and angioedema. She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. She is being treated with antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and she requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of respiratory failure due to pneumonia, sepsis, or other underlying conditions.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of sepsis due to her ESRD, immunocompromised state, and recent episode of sepsis.
3. Angioedema: The patient has a history of angioedema, and there is a risk of recurrence due to her ESRD and medication use.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and there is a risk of further imbalance due to her ESRD, dialysis, and medication use.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to her ESRD, immunocompromised state, and recent episode of sepsis.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, and there is a risk of cardiovascular complications due to her ESRD, medication use, and underlying conditions.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient has a history of seizures and altered mental status, and there is a risk of further neurological complications due to her ESRD, medication use, and underlying conditions.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to monitor her closely and adjust her treatment plan as necessary to prevent and manage potential medical complications."

   This is a 63 yo female with PMH of ESRD on HD s/p failed kidney
   transplant, recent ex-lap for benign pneumatosis, who presents with
   acute episode of AMS.
   .
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: The episode of decreased responsiveness is
   likely due to postictal state coupled with medication effect (ativan,
   propofol).  Her mental status now is appropriate. Head CT and tox
   screens were negative.   EEG (prelim) negative for status.   Would hold
   off on using ativan for any recurrent seizure as it may have been
   responsible for her angioedema yesterday.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), who presented with an acute episode of altered mental status (AMS). The patient's AMS was likely due to a postictal state and medication effect. 

The patient has been experiencing various medical complications, including:

1. Angioedema: The patient developed angioedema, which may have been caused by the administration of ativan. The patient has a history of?tracheal stenosis, which may affect her ability to develop a cuff leak.
2. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which is being treated with metoprolol and amlodipine. Lisinopril has been discontinued due to its association with angioedema.
3. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, which is being treated with a statin.
4. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has diabetes mellitus, which is being managed with RISS and FSG.
5. ESRD on HD: The patient has missed two outpatient HD sessions and was dialyzed yesterday in the MICU. Daily dialysis is being continued to treat uremia.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is being treated with coumadin. The INR is subtherapeutic, and it is unclear if the patient is compliant with her home medications. Metoprolol has been restarted for rate control.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's angioedema may lead to respiratory failure if it is not managed promptly.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure.
3. Renal complications: The patient's ESRD on HD may lead to further renal complications, such as acute kidney injury, if her dialysis is not managed properly.
4. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system may increase her risk of infection, particularly respiratory and urinary tract infections.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's diabetes and hypertension may increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding and pancreatitis.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk of developing various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent these complications and ensure the patient's overall well-being."

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are identified:

Summary:

The patient has been in the ICU for several days, receiving various medications and treatments. They have been on a heparin drip, which was discontinued due to delays in midline placement. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, and blood pressure of 139/60 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy through an endotracheal tube and are on a ventilator. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and lactate, indicating potential kidney and metabolic derangements.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 32. This may indicate underlying respiratory failure or impending respiratory arrest.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, with a systolic pressure of 139 mmHg, which may indicate underlying cardiac disease or hypertension.
3. Renal Complications: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential kidney damage or failure. This may require further evaluation and treatment.
4. Metabolic Complications: The patient's potassium level is elevated, which may indicate underlying metabolic derangements or electrolyte imbalances.
5. Infection Complications: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to address this concern.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status is not well-documented, but the patient's lack of response to stimuli and abnormal tone may indicate underlying neurological damage or dysfunction.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's abdominal pain and nausea may indicate underlying gastrointestinal issues, such as pancreatitis or bowel obstruction.

Based on these findings, further evaluation and treatment are necessary to address these potential medical complications and ensure the patient's overall well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 yo female with PMH of ESRD on HD s/p failed kidney
   transplant, recent ex-lap for benign pneumatosis, who presents with
   acute episode of AMS.
   #Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection in setting of
   altered mental status.  Now, with persistant apnea of unclear
   etiology
even when awake.   Does not have cuff leak, but has ? history
   of tracheal stenosis after previous trach.
   -plan to try to extuabate today with anesthesia present in case of need
   for urgent reintubation
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: The episode of decreased responsiveness is
   likely due to postictal state coupled with medication effect (ativan,
   propofol).  Her mental status now is appropriate. Head CT and tox
   screens were negative.   EEG (prelim) negative for status.
   -- neuro following
   -- depakote [**Hospital1 **], will taper dose per neuro
   -- continue keppra , currently at 500 [**Hospital1 7**] and extra dose with HD
   -- daily HD to treat uremia
   -- Seizure precautions
   .
   #angioedema- may have been due to ativan administration.   Given
   steroids x 24 hours, but still without cuff leak today.  Has h/o
   ?tracheal stenosis, so may not ever develop cuff leak.
   -hold ativan
   -hold lisinopril  as this is also associated with angioedema
   -will need outpatient allergy workup
   -monitor for now
   -anticipate extubation later today.
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Missed 2 outpatient HD sessions. Dialyzed yesterday in
   MICU.
   -daily dialysis to treat uremia per renal
   -- continue nephrocaps and sensipar
   -- renally dose meds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   -plan to try to extuabate today with anesthesia present in case of need
   for urgent reintubation
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: The episode of decreased responsiveness is
   likely due to postictal state coupled with medication effect (ativan,
   propofol).  Her mental status now is appropriate. Head CT and tox

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who presented with acute mental status changes (AMS) and was intubated for airway protection. She has been experiencing persistent apnea despite being awake, which is unclear in etiology. The patient's mental status is currently appropriate, and her head CT and toxicology screens were negative. She has a history of tracheal stenosis after a previous tracheostomy.

The patient is currently on multiple medications, including Keppra, Depakote, and Heparin, and is receiving daily HD to treat uremia. She is also taking medications for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, as well as decreased hemoglobin and albumin levels. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a tidal volume of 400-850 mL and a respiratory rate of 12-20 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 100%, and her blood pressure is 112/53 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent apnea despite being awake may indicate a respiratory failure, which could be due to a variety of factors, including pneumonia, aspiration, or respiratory muscle weakness.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and LDH levels may indicate an underlying sepsis, which could be caused by a variety of factors, including pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or surgical site infection.
3. Uremic complications: The patient's ESRD and HD may increase her risk of developing uremic complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and seizures.
4. Angioedema: The patient's history of angioedema and her current treatment with Heparin may increase her risk of developing angioedema again.
5. Tracheal stenosis: The patient's history of tracheal stenosis after a previous tracheostomy may increase her risk of developing tracheal stenosis again, which could lead to respiratory failure.
6. Infection: The patient's history of tracheostomy and her current intubation may increase her risk of developing an infection, such as pneumonia or tracheitis.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and hyperlipidemia may increase her risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her ventilator settings as necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medications as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her HD schedule as necessary.
4. Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's treatment regimen to prevent and treat potential infections.
5. Consider adding anti-seizure medications to the patient's treatment regimen to prevent and treat potential seizures.
6. Consider adding a tracheostomy to the patient's treatment regimen to improve her respiratory status and reduce her risk of developing tracheal stenosis.
7. Consider adding a cardioverter-defibrillator to the patient's treatment regimen to reduce her risk of developing cardiovascular complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 64 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 112/53 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate that they have a severe sepsis with a white blood cell count of 344 K/uL, and elevated lactate levels of 0.9 mmol/L. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 14.5 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 27.4 mg/dL.

The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with a potassium level of 3.3 mEq/L and a magnesium level of 1.8 mg/dL. The patient's liver function is impaired, with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels.

The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.4 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 38.9 seconds. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, with a troponin-T level of 513 ng/mL.

The patient's respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube, and they are receiving mechanical ventilation with a pressure support of 5 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 40 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 120 mmHg.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction: The patient's laboratory results indicate severe sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and they require mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
5. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver function is impaired, which can lead to coagulopathy, jaundice, and other complications.
6. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, which can indicate myocardial injury or infarction.
7. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, which can lead to acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
8. Infection: The patient's sepsis may be complicated by secondary infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
10. Stress ulcer: The patient's prolonged critical illness increases the risk of developing stress ulcers.

In summary, the patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical history, who requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 year old female with PMH of ESRD on HD s/p failed kidney
   transplant, recent ex-lap for benign pneumatosis, admitted with AMS
   likely secondary to opioids and missed dialysis, transferred to MICU
   after intubation for airway protection following a seizure +/-
   angioedema secondary to ?ativan.
   1.  Airway.  Patient initially intubated for airway protection in
   post-ictal state +/- angioedema secondary to ?ativan.  Was apneic and
   without cuff leak initially.  Extubated yesterday and doing well now on
   room air.
   2.  AMS.  Admitted for altered mental status, likely secondary to
   missing dialysis and opioids at home.  Her mental status now is
   appropriate. Head CT and tox screens were negative.   EEG (prelim)
   negative for status.
   -- neuro following
   -- d/c depakote
   -- continue keppra , currently at 500 [**Hospital1 7**] and extra dose with HD
   -- daily HD to treat uremia
   -- Seizure precautions
   .
   3.  Angioedema.  This  may have been due to ativan administration.
   Given steroids x 24 hours, but still without cuff leak yesterday.  Has
   h/o ?tracheal stenosis, so may not ever develop cuff leak.
   -hold ativan
   -hold lisinopril  as this is also associated with angioedema
   -will need outpatient allergy workup
   -monitor for now
   -anticipate extubation later today.
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: Dialyzed today.
   -daily dialysis to treat uremia per renal
   -- continue nephrocaps and sensipar
   -- renally dose meds
   -- epo at HD
   .
   5.  Afib on coumadin.  Patient admitted with subtherapeutic INR so
   unclear if taking meds at home.
   -- metoprolol for rate control
   -- IV BB prn RVR
   --restarted coumadin yesterday
   - follow PTT
   .
   6.       HTN: on metoprolol and amlodipine. Discontinue lisinopril due
   to association with angioedema.
   - increase amlodipine to home dose

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a complex medical history, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), recent failed kidney transplant, and a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status (AMS) likely secondary to missing dialysis and opioids at home. She was intubated for airway protection after a seizure and possible angioedema secondary to Ativan administration.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Airway: Extubated yesterday and doing well on room air.
* AMS: Mental status is now appropriate, and head CT and tox screens were negative.
* Angioedema: May have been due to Ativan administration, and steroids were given for 24 hours. The patient has a history of possible tracheal stenosis, which may affect her ability to develop a cuff leak.
* ESRD on HD: Dialyzed today, and daily dialysis will be continued to treat uremia.
* Afib on coumadin: Patient was admitted with subtherapeutic INR, and coumadin was restarted yesterday. Metoprolol was started for rate control.
* HTN: On metoprolol and amlodipine, and lisinopril was discontinued due to association with angioedema.
* Hyperlipidemia: Statin therapy will be continued.
* DM: RISS, FSG qid, and diabetic/renal diet will be continued.
* FEN: Diabetic/renal diet will be continued.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection, and extubation may be challenging due to possible tracheal stenosis.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and Afib on coumadin, which may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications.
* Renal failure: The patient has ESRD on HD, and daily dialysis will be continued to treat uremia.
* Infection: The patient has a history of possible tracheal stenosis, which may increase her risk of respiratory infections.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of possible angioedema and may be at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
* Neurological complications: The patient has a history of seizures and may be at risk for further neurological complications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 year old female with PMH of ESRD on HD s/p failed kidney
   transplant, recent ex-lap for benign pneumatosis, admitted with AMS
   likely secondary to opioids and missed dialysis, transferred to MICU
   after intubation for airway protection following a seizure +/-
   angioedema secondary to ?ativan.
   1.  Airway.  Patient initially intubated for airway protection in
   post-ictal state +/- angioedema secondary to ?ativan.  Was apneic and
   without cuff leak initially.  Extubated yesterday and doing well now on
   room air.
   2.  AMS.  Admitted for altered mental status, likely secondary to
   missing dialysis and opioids at home.  Her mental status now is
   appropriate. Head CT and tox screens were negative.   EEG (prelim)
   negative for status.
   -- neuro following
   -- d/c depakote
   -- continue keppra , currently at 500 [**Hospital1 7**] and extra dose with HD
   -- daily HD to treat uremia
   -- Seizure precautions
   .
   3.  Angioedema.  This  may have been due to ativan administration.
   Given steroids x 24 hours, but still without cuff leak yesterday.  Has
   h/o ?tracheal stenosis, so may not ever develop cuff leak.
   -hold ativan
   -hold lisinopril  as this is also associated with angioedema

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a complex medical history, including ESRD on HD, failed kidney transplant, and recent ex-lap for benign pneumatosis. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS) likely secondary to missing dialysis and opioids at home. She was intubated for airway protection following a seizure and possible angioedema secondary to?ativan.

Current vital signs:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* Heart rate: 69 bpm (63-77 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 134/64 mmHg (81-152/97-102 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 13 breaths/min (13-21 breaths/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

Laboratory results:

* Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 390 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 9.6 K/uL
* Creatinine: 14.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 63 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 6.2 mg/dL
* Albumin: 4.3 g/dL
* LDH: 237 IU/L
* Ca++: 8.2 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL
* PO4: 6.2 mg/dL

Medical conditions and concerns:

* ESRD on HD: The patient is on daily dialysis to treat uremia.
* Angioedema: The patient may have developed angioedema secondary to?ativan administration, and is being monitored for further episodes.
* Hypertension: The patient is on metoprolol and amlodipine for blood pressure control.
* Hyperlipidemia: The patient is on a statin for lipid management.
* Diabetes: The patient has diabetes and is on an insulin sliding scale.
* Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of seizures and is being treated with Keppra.
* Airway management: The patient was intubated for airway protection and was recently extubated.

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of respiratory failure due to her underlying chronic respiratory disease and potential for further airway compromise.
* Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of hypertension and may be at risk for cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
* Neurological complications: The patient has a history of seizures and may be at risk for further neurological complications, such as status epilepticus or cerebral edema.
* Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her indwelling catheters and potential for colonization of the respiratory tract.
* Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to her platelet count and potential for anticoagulation therapy.

Assessment and plan:

* The patient's airway is stable, but she will require continued monitoring for signs of airway compromise.
* The patient's AMS is improving, but she will require continued monitoring for signs of worsening mental status.
* The patient's angioedema is being monitored, and she will require further evaluation and treatment as needed.
* The patient's ESRD on HD will require continued dialysis therapy to manage her uremia.
* The patient's hypertension will require continued management with medications.
* The patient's hyperlipidemia will require continued management with medications.
* The patient's diabetes will require continued management with insulin therapy.
* The patient's seizure disorder will require continued management with Keppra therapy.
* The patient's airway management will require continued monitoring and adjustment as needed.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a range of medical complications, including respiratory failure, cardiac complications, neurological complications, infection, and bleeding. Continued close monitoring and management of her medical conditions will be necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 year old female with PMH of ESRD on HD s/p failed kidney
   transplant, recent ex-lap for benign pneumatosis, who presents with
   acute episode of AMS.
   #Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection in setting of
   altered mental status.  Now, with persistant apnea of unclear
   etiology
even when awake.   Does not have cuff leak, but has ? history
   of tracheal stenosis after previous trach.
   -plan to try to extuabate today with anesthesia present in case of need
   for urgent reintubation
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: The episode of decreased responsiveness is
   likely due to postictal state coupled with medication effect (ativan,
   propofol).  Her mental status now is appropriate. Head CT and tox
   screens were negative.   EEG (prelim) negative for status.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) following a failed kidney transplant, recent ex-lap for benign pneumatosis, and a recent episode of altered mental status (AMS). She was intubated for airway protection and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.2°F (36.8°C), heart rate of 69 bpm, and blood pressure of 134/64 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes a nasal cannula with a FiO2 of 40% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient has several medical conditions, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status, and now has persistent apnea of unclear etiology.
2. Altered mental status: The episode of decreased responsiveness is likely due to a postictal state coupled with medication effect. Her mental status is now appropriate.
3. Angioedema: The patient may have had angioedema due to ativan administration, which is being held. She has a history of tracheal stenosis, which may not allow for cuff leak.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient has missed two outpatient HD sessions and is receiving daily dialysis to treat uremia.
5. Afib on coumadin: The patient's INR is subtherapeutic, and it is unclear if she is compliant with her home medications.
6. HTN: The patient is on metoprolol and amlodipine, and lisinopril has been discontinued due to association with angioedema.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is receiving a statin.
8. DM: The patient's glucose levels are being monitored and managed with insulin sliding scale.
9. FEN: The patient is NPO for now.
10. ACCESS: The patient has a PIV and an HD cath for emergency, and is trying for a PICC today.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent apnea may lead to respiratory arrest or further respiratory compromise.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status may deteriorate further, leading to increased risk of falls, aspiration, or other complications.
3. Angioedema: The patient's angioedema may worsen, leading to airway compromise or other systemic complications.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient's uremia may worsen, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Afib on coumadin: The patient's subtherapeutic INR may lead to bleeding complications or increased risk of stroke.
6. HTN: The patient's hypertension may worsen, leading to increased risk of cardiovascular complications.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may worsen, leading to increased risk of cardiovascular complications.
8. DM: The patient's diabetes may worsen, leading to increased risk of complications such as ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic coma, or diabetic nephropathy.
9. FEN: The patient's fasting status may lead to malnutrition, dehydration, or other complications.
10. ACCESS: The patient's access issues may lead to further complications such as bleeding, infection, or catheter malfunction.

Based on this assessment, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiac, and metabolic status, as well as ongoing management of her underlying medical conditions."
