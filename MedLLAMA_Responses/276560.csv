You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOGLYCEMIA
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   Assessment and Plan: 62 year old female with a history of alcohol abuse
   transferred to this hospital for management of a possible subarachnoid
   hemorrhage now admitted to the MICU for management of alcohol
   withdrawal.  She was not considered to have competency to leave AMA
   last night.
   Decision making: She has very poor insight into her overall situation
   and does not appear worried by her repeated falls while intoxicated at
   home.  She was seen by psych last night who did not feel she had
   capacity to risk withdrawal at home last night.  She does not have
   improved capacity today, but her risk of withdrawal is now largely
   passed.
   - Will talk again w/ psych this morning.  Her competency has not
   improved, but her imminent medical risk has also decreased.
   Alcohol withdrawal:  Self reports long history of alcohol abuse which
   she says is improving, though alcohol level was in the 600s on
   presentation to [**Hospital3 **].  This morning she is calm,
   non-tremulous with CIWA scores of [**2-18**] off of valium.  She is unable to
   give a clear plan of how she will remain sober at home, but does not
   want to consider rehab.
   - valium 10 mg IV Q1H:PRN CIWA > 10
   - thiamine, folate, multivitamins
   - social work consult -> she is now willing to talk to social work.
   s/p fall:  Patient currently confused and reports history of fall with
   possible head trauma.  Transferred for possible subarachnoid hemorrhage
   at OSH.  Here CT head and C-spine negative, C-spine cleared yesterday.
   She is still at high risk of falls at home and cannot articulate a plan
   to be safer at home.
   - PT eval.
   Skin Lesions:  Patient with multiple small superficial lesions on her
   back and lower extremities with mild erythema.  She has no leukocytosis
   or fevers and lesions do not appear super-infected.  We can continue
   Keflex while she is here pending wound cultures, but she does not need
   to go home with a course of antibiotics.
   - f/u blood and wound cultures.
   Tobacco Abuse:
   - nicotine patch
   FEN: regular diet, replete electrolytes.
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin
   Communication: w/ patient and husband.  [**Name (NI) 133**] contact PCP today by
   email.
   Code: Full code.
   Dispo: She should stay here through the day to see if we can resolve
   pending issues and send her home tonight.  To floor in evening if still
   here.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, admitted to the MICU for management of a possible subarachnoid hemorrhage and alcohol withdrawal. The patient has been experiencing hypoglycemia, pain, and delirium tremens (DTs) symptoms. She has a history of falls and possible head trauma, which may have contributed to her current condition.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 144/87 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100%. Her physical examination reveals ecchymosis over the right side of her face and injected right conjunctiva, as well as multiple healing excoriations on her back and lower extremities.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 186 K/uL. Her blood glucose level is 122 mg/dL, and her liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 141 mg/dL and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 40 mg/dL.

The patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including:

1. Seizures: The patient's history of DTs and elevated LFTs increase her risk of seizures.
2. Infections: The patient's multiple skin lesions and elevated white blood cell count may indicate the presence of an infection.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is unstable, with a total fluid intake of 7,245 mL and a total fluid output of 5,390 mL.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 3.1 mEq/L and a phosphorus level of 1.5 mg/dL.
5. Delirium: The patient's delirium tremens symptoms may persist or worsen if not properly managed.

To manage these potential complications, the patient should continue to receive valium for pain control and delirium management. She should also receive prophylactic antibiotics for her skin lesions and continue to receive fluids and electrolyte replacement as needed. The patient's family should be educated on the importance of proper wound care and infection prevention."

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOGLYCEMIA
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   Assessment and Plan: 62 year old female with a history of alcohol abuse
   transferred to this hospital for management of a possible subarachnoid
   hemorrhage now admitted to the MICU for management of alcohol
   withdrawal.  She was not considered to have competency to leave AMA
   last night.
   Decision making: She has very poor insight into her overall situation
   and does not appear worried by her repeated falls while intoxicated at
   home.  She was seen by psych last night who did not feel she had
   capacity to risk withdrawal at home last night.  She does not have
   improved capacity today, but her risk of withdrawal is now largely
   passed.
   - Will talk again w/ psych this morning.  Her competency has not
   improved, but her imminent medical risk has also decreased.
   Alcohol withdrawal:  Self reports long history of alcohol abuse which
   she says is improving, though alcohol level was in the 600s on
   presentation to [**Hospital3 **].  This morning she is calm,
   non-tremulous with CIWA scores of [**2-18**] off of valium.  She is unable to
   give a clear plan of how she will remain sober at home, but does not
   want to consider rehab.
   - valium 10 mg IV Q1H:PRN CIWA > 10
   - thiamine, folate, multivitamins
   - social work consult -> she is now willing to talk to social work.
   s/p fall:  Patient currently confused and reports history of fall with
   possible head trauma.  Transferred for possible subarachnoid hemorrhage
   at OSH.  Here CT head and C-spine negative, C-spine cleared yesterday.
   She is still at high risk of falls at home and cannot articulate a plan
   to be safer at home.
   - PT eval.
   Skin Lesions:  Patient with multiple small superficial lesions on her
   back and lower extremities with mild erythema.  She has no leukocytosis
   or fevers and lesions do not appear super-infected.  We can continue
   Keflex while she is here pending wound cultures, but she does not need
   to go home with a course of antibiotics.
   - f/u blood and wound cultures.
   Tobacco Abuse:
   - nicotine patch
   FEN: regular diet, replete electrolytes.
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin
   Communication: w/ patient and husband.  [**Name (NI) 133**] contact PCP today by
   email.
   Code: Full code.
   Dispo: She should stay here through the day to see if we can resolve
   pending issues and send her home tonight.  To floor in evening if still
   here.

   Overnight, demanding to leave but unable to explain reasons to leave.
   Seen by psych who agreed that pt lacked capacity to make this
   decision.  Received 60 Valium, last at 9am (requested, not meeting req
   for CIWA).

   Agree with plan for with SW, Psych re-eval, PT if agreeable.
   Difficult situation as lacks insight, but whether truly lacks capacity
   is not clear.
   Based on d/w psych, is not committable to psych facility.  Does lack
   insight (and thus capacity) d/t dementia regarding medical decision
   making, and likely to return home to EtOH abuse and subsequent falls.
   No medical reasons to keep her as is improved from withdrawal
   standpoint, no further treatment needed.
   Pt is adamant about leaving, and says that she will stop drinking and
   be more careful to avoid falling.  Currently appears that risks of
   pharmacological and physical restraints likely needed to keep patient
   here, outweigh potential benefits.
   D/w resident, pt, husband, to the best of my ability, need to stop EtOH
   abuse and need to ensure safety at home.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: EtOH withdrawal
   24 Hour Events:
   - [**1-17**] amp D50 for hypoglycemia in early AM
   - getting valium 10mg for CIWA's [**12-29**] -> total 40mg in AM, then
   improved.
   - changed vanco to keflex for question skin infection.
   - social work -> haven't come yet.
   - patient demanding to leave AMA through afternoon.  Saying she wants
   to be at home in her bed with her dogs. Unable to really fully explain
   what would happen to her.  Seen by psychiatry -> generally intact, but
   does not have capacity for this decision, so can be kept against will.
   On further discussion, patient amenable to staying at least overnight.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, admitted to the ICU for management of a possible subarachnoid hemorrhage and alcohol withdrawal. She has been experiencing hypoglycemia, pain, and acute and chronic pain, and has a history of falls while intoxicated. She was seen by psychiatry and was deemed to lack capacity to make medical decisions, including leaving against medical advice (AMA). She was given valium to manage her withdrawal symptoms and has been cooperative with her treatment plan.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 144/87 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 100%. Her laboratory results show mild anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function.

The patient has multiple small superficial lesions on her back and lower extremities, which are being treated with keflex. She is at high risk of falls at home and has no clear plan to be safer at home.

Potential medical complications:

1. Seizures: The patient is at risk of developing seizures due to her history of alcohol withdrawal and the use of valium.
2. Infection: The patient has multiple small superficial lesions on her back and lower extremities, which are being treated with keflex. She is at risk of developing an infection, especially if the lesions become infected.
3. Fall-related injuries: The patient is at high risk of falls at home and has no clear plan to be safer at home. She may suffer from fall-related injuries, such as head trauma, if she continues to fall.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she is at risk of developing respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, if she develops an infection.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but she is at risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as hypertension, if she continues to consume alcohol.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may indicate liver damage. She is at risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as pancreatitis, if she continues to consume alcohol.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is stable, but she is at risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures, if she continues to experience withdrawal symptoms."

 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   Assessment and Plan: 62 year old female with a history of alcohol abuse
   transferred to this hospital for management of a possible subarachnoid
   hemorrhage now admitted to the MICU for management of alcohol
   withdrawal.  There are now significant concerns for her safety at home.
   Dementia/decision making: She has very poor insight into her overall
   situation and does not appear worried by her repeated falls while
   intoxicated at home.  She is showing more signs of dementia at this
   time, though we do not know her baseline functional status.  She does
   not show signs of delirium.  We cannot provide a safe discharge plan at
   this time and she does not have capacity to decide to leave AMA.
   - f/u psych recommendations
   - establish contact with patient
s PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Social work is trying to establish contact with her daughter.
   Alcohol withdrawal:  Now stable and has not gotten valium for over
   24hrs, making her stable for transfer to the floor.  Self reports long
   history of alcohol abuse which she says is improving, though alcohol
   level was in the 600s on presentation to [**Hospital3 **].  This
   morning she is calm, non-tremulous with CIWA scores of [**2-18**] off of
   valium.  She is unable to give a clear plan of how she will remain
   sober at home, but does not want to consider rehab.
   - continue valium 10 mg IV Q1H:PRN CIWA > 10
   - thiamine, folate, multivitamins
   - social work consult
   s/p fall:  Physical therapy felt the patient is so unsteady that she
   should have placement with 24 hour supervision/assistance and use a
   walker at all times if at home.  She was transferred for possible
   subarachnoid hemorrhage at OSH.  Here CT head and C-spine negative,
   C-spine cleared yesterday.  Her inability to understand that she is at
   imminent risks for falls is probably the main reason she needs to stay
   inpatient at this time.
   UTI:  Patient
s urine culture grew >100,000 gram negative rods.  She
   was already on Keflex for possible super-infection of her skin
   lesions.  We will not start any other antibiotics unless the GNRs are
   cephalosporin resistant.
   Skin Lesions:  Patient with multiple small superficial lesions on her
   back and lower extremities with mild erythema.  She has no leukocytosis
   or fevers and lesions do not appear super-infected.  We can continue
   Keflex while she is here pending wound cultures, but she does not need
   to go home with a course of antibiotics.
   - f/u blood and wound cultures.
   Tobacco Abuse:
   - nicotine patch
   FEN: regular diet, replete electrolytes.
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, admitted to the MICU for management of a possible subarachnoid hemorrhage and now for alcohol withdrawal. The patient has been stable on valium for 24 hours, with a CIWA score of 2-18. She is unable to give a clear plan for remaining sober at home and does not want to consider rehab.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Delirium tremens (DTs) due to alcohol withdrawal, which can lead to seizures, hallucinations, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Seizures, which can be a complication of DTs or due to other underlying conditions such as subarachnoid hemorrhage.
3. Hypoglycemia, which is already present and can worsen if not properly managed.
4. UTI, which has already been diagnosed and may require further treatment.
5. Skin lesions, which may become super-infected if not properly managed.
6. Falls, which are a significant concern due to the patient's impaired gait and lack of understanding of her situation.
7. DVT, which is being prophylactically treated with subcutaneous heparin.
8. VAP, which is a potential complication of prolonged ICU stay.
9. Wound infections, which may occur if the patient's skin lesions become super-infected.

The patient's current medical status is stable, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent these potential complications. Further evaluation of her home situation is recommended before discharge to the floor."

 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   Assessment and Plan: 62 year old female with a history of alcohol abuse
   transferred to this hospital for management of a possible subarachnoid
   hemorrhage now admitted to the MICU for management of alcohol
   withdrawal.  She was not considered to have competency to leave AMA
   last night.
   Decision making: She has very poor insight into her overall situation
   and does not appear worried by her repeated falls while intoxicated at
   home.  She was seen by psych last night who did not feel she had
   capacity to risk withdrawal at home last night.  She does not have
   improved capacity today, but her risk of withdrawal is now largely
   passed.
   - Will talk again w/ psych this morning.  Her competency has not
   improved, but her imminent medical risk has also decreased.
   Alcohol withdrawal:  Self reports long history of alcohol abuse which
   she says is improving, though alcohol level was in the 600s on
   presentation to [**Hospital3 **].  This morning she is calm,
   non-tremulous with CIWA scores of [**2-18**] off of valium.  She is unable to
   give a clear plan of how she will remain sober at home, but does not
   want to consider rehab.
   - valium 10 mg IV Q1H:PRN CIWA > 10
   - thiamine, folate, multivitamins
   - social work consult -> she is now willing to talk to social work.
   s/p fall:  Patient currently confused and reports history of fall with

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan: 62 year old female with a history of alcohol abuse
   transferred to this hospital for management of a possible subarachnoid
   hemorrhage now admitted to the MICU for management of alcohol
   withdrawal.  She was not considered to have competency to leave AMA
   last night.
   Decision making: She has very poor insight into her overall situation
   and does not appear worried by her repeated falls while intoxicated at
   home.  She was seen by psych last night who did not feel she had
   capacity to risk withdrawal at home last night.  She does not have
   improved capacity today, but her risk of withdrawal is now largely
   passed.
   - Will talk again w/ psych this morning.  Her competency has not
   improved, but her imminent medical risk has also decreased.
   Alcohol withdrawal:  Self reports long history of alcohol abuse which
   she says is improving, though alcohol level was in the 600s on
   presentation to [**Hospital3 **].  This morning she is calm,
   non-tremulous with CIWA scores of [**2-18**] off of valium.  She is unable to
   give a clear plan of how she will remain sober at home, but does not
   want to consider rehab.
   - valium 10 mg IV Q1H:PRN CIWA > 10
   - thiamine, folate, multivitamins
   - social work consult -> she is now willing to talk to social work.
   s/p fall:  Patient currently confused and reports history of fall with
   possible head trauma.  Transferred for possible subarachnoid hemorrhage
   at OSH.  Here CT head and C-spine negative, C-spine cleared yesterday.
   She is still at high risk of falls at home and cannot articulate a plan
   to be safer at home.
   - PT eval.
   Skin Lesions:  Patient with multiple small superficial lesions on her
   back and lower extremities with mild erythema.  She has no leukocytosis
   or fevers and lesions do not appear super-infected.  We can continue
   Keflex while she is here pending wound cultures, but she does not need
   to go home with a course of antibiotics.
   - f/u blood and wound cultures.

   - nicotine patch
   FEN: regular diet, replete electrolytes.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, admitted to the ICU for management of a possible subarachnoid hemorrhage and alcohol withdrawal. She was not considered competent to leave against medical advice (AMA) last night and still lacks capacity to make decisions today. The patient reports a long history of alcohol abuse and is currently calm, non-tremulous, and CIWA scores are 2-18 off valium. She is unable to provide a clear plan for remaining sober at home and does not want to consider rehabilitation.

The patient has multiple small superficial lesions on her back and lower extremities with mild erythema, which are being treated with Keflex pending wound cultures. She is at high risk of falls at home and has a history of falls with possible head trauma.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Delirium Tremens (DTs): The patient is at risk of developing DTs due to her history of alcohol abuse and current withdrawal symptoms.
2. Seizures: The patient's history of falls and possible head trauma increases her risk of seizures, which could be exacerbated by her alcohol withdrawal.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of poor nutrition and potential malnutrition increases her risk of hypoglycemia, which could be exacerbated by her alcohol withdrawal.
4. Infection: The patient's superficial lesions on her back and lower extremities are at risk of infection, which could be complicated by her impaired immune function due to her alcohol abuse.
5. Falls: The patient is at high risk of falls at home, which could lead to further injuries, particularly to her head.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of falls and possible head trauma increases her risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of falls and possible head trauma increases her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue valium 10 mg IV Q1H as needed to manage CIWA scores.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and neurological status closely for signs of delirium tremens, seizures, or hypoglycemia.
3. Provide wound care and antibiotics as necessary for the patient's superficial lesions.
4. Consider a social work consult to help the patient develop a plan for remaining sober at home.
5. Monitor the patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Consider a prophylactic anticonvulsant medication to reduce the risk of seizures.
7. Consider a prophylactic antibiotic medication to reduce the risk of infection.
8. Monitor the patient's mental status and cognitive function closely for signs of impaired knowledge, gait, or balance."
