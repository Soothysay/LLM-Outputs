   Assessment and Plan
   69F with DM2, HTN, recent diverticulitis and nephrolithiasis presents
   with fevers, rigors and tachycardia after lithotripsy and ureteral
   stent placement.
   # Fever: High fever with rigors concerning for bacterial
   infection/bacteremia.  Given recent GU manipulation most likely source
   is urine, especially given positive UA.  CXR clear, no localizing
   pulmonary symptoms suggestive of pneumonia.  PE unlikely given acuity,
   degree of fever and lack of hypoxia.  Pt has history of recent
   antibiotic tx raising concern for c. diff although leukocytosis lower
   than previously and no diarrhea.  Also had treatment for diverticulitis
   2 months ago with associated microperforation, although non-tender on
   abd exam with no recent abd pain or change in stool.  Did have
   relatively recent knee tap, but without evidence for prior or ongoing
   infection in the joint.
   -blood cultures
   -urine cultures
   -Empiric antibiotics with vanc (given recent procedure), cipro/ctx for
   double GNR coverage for potential GU source
   -Tylenol PRN fevers
   -c. diff toxin
   -r/o flu
   -Low threshold for CT abd to eval for abscess if continues to spike.
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach.  Pt most likely dry based on subjective
   thirst, procedurization, febrility and prolonged NPO status prior to
   procedure.
   -PO and IV hydration overnight
   -Check TSH
   -1gram tylenol prn fever
   -tx likely infection as above.
   # ARF: Creatinine has ranged 1.0-2.0 in past 3 months, baseline likely
   1-1.3.  Had ARF in setting of diverticulitis which fully resolved, had
   cr of 2.0 as outpatient for unclear reasons, was 1.6 prior to procedure
   and 1.9 currently.  Urine lytes with FeNa 2%, in setting of pt being on
   HCTZ yesterday and after hydration, so is less informative. Elevation
   likely pre-renal despite this.
   -Hold lisinopril and HCTZ acutely
   -Agressive IVF/PO hydration
   -Tx infection as above
   -consider repeat GU imaging if persists to ensure no new obstruction in
   setting of instrumentation, although unlikely given stent in place.
   # Nephrolithiasis: s/p lithotripsy/ureteral stent replacement
   -f/u urology recs

   # HTN:
   -continue atenolol, hold HCTZ/ACEI as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, recent diverticulitis, and nephrolithiasis who was admitted to the ICU with fevers, rigors, and tachycardia after lithotripsy and ureteral stent placement.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.9°C (100.3°F)
* Heart rate: 107 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 116/60 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's physical examination is notable for tachycardia, regular heart rhythm, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft, diffusely non-tender to deep palpation, and the Foley catheter is draining pink urine.

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 29.9 K/μL
* Hemoglobin: 8.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 350 K/μL
* Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 31 mg/dL
* Glucose: 138 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.7 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.8 g/dL
* Calcium: 7.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.1 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* High fever with rigors concerning for bacterial infection or bacteremia, likely due to a urinary source given the positive urine culture and recent GU manipulation.
* Empiric antibiotics with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftiaxone for double GNR coverage.
* Tylenol PRN for fever.
* Low threshold for CT abdomen to evaluate for abscess if the fever persists.
* Sinus tachycardia likely due to dehydration, fever, and prolonged NPO status.
* PO and IV hydration overnight.
* Check TSH.
* 1 gram of tylenol PRN for fever.
* Treatment of infection as above.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis due to bacterial infection or bacteremia.
* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to pre-renal azotemia or tubular damage.
* Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia due to diabetes and medication changes.
* Hypotension or hypertension due to dehydration, medication changes, or underlying medical conditions.
* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
* Cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock due to underlying cardiac disease or medication changes.

The patient's ICU care plan includes aggressive IV and PO hydration, hold of lisinopril and HCTZ acutely, and treatment of infection as above. The patient will also require close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to ensure prompt detection and management of potential complications."

   with fevers, rigors and tachycardia after lithotripsy and ureteral
   stent placement.
   # Fever: High fever with rigors concerning for bacterial
   infection/bacteremia.  Given recent GU manipulation most likely source
   is urine, especially given positive UA.  Pt has history of recent
   antibiotic tx raising concern for c. diff and now with elevated WBC
   count there is a high concern for C. diff even without diarrhea.  Also
   had treatment for diverticulitis 2 months ago with associated
   microperforation, although non-tender on abd exam with no recent abd
   pain or change in stool.  Did have relatively recent knee tap, but
   without evidence for prior or ongoing infection in the joint.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, recent diverticulitis, and nephrolithiasis who presented with fevers, rigors, and tachycardia after lithotripsy and ureteral stent placement. The patient has been treated with empiric antibiotics, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and flagyl, for potential bacterial infection, particularly in the urinary tract.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.9°C (100.3°F)
* Heart rate: 107 bpm (98-117 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 116/60 mmHg (72-120/65 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute (21-31 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Tachycardia
* Minimal rhales in the lower lobes of the lungs
* Soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds
* No edema or peripheral pulses abnormalities

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 29.9 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 27.2%
* Platelet count: 350 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 138 mg/dL
* Glucose: 138 mg/dL
* Other lab results, including PT, PTT, INR, lactic acid, albumin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* High fever with rigors, concerning for bacterial infection or bacteremia
* Elevated white blood cell count and possible C. difficile infection
* Tachycardia, likely due to dehydration and infection
* Acute renal failure, possibly pre-renal in etiology
* Hypokalemia, likely due to diuresis
* Nephrolithiasis, with a Foley catheter in place
* Hypertension, with ongoing treatment with atenolol
* Diabetes, with oral antihyperglycemics held and a diabetic diet in place

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to untreated bacterial infection
* C. difficile colitis or pseudomembranous colitis
* Acute kidney injury or acute tubular necrosis due to pre-renal or post-renal causes
* Hypokalemia or hypophosphatemia due to diuresis or other causes
* Nephrolithiasis or urinary tract obstruction
* Hypertensive crisis or cardiac complications due to hypertension
* Diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome due to untreated diabetes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis, complicated by nephrolithiasis and post-operative tachycardia and fever. She has a history of ureteral stent replacement and lithotripsy. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics (Vanco, Flagyl, CTX, and Cipro) for coverage of possible urinary source of sepsis. She is also receiving fluid boluses for volume support and vasodilatory state. The patient's abdominal exam is reassuring, and CT abdomen is planned to rule out abscess. She has acute renal failure, and IVF and fluid bolus are being given to resolve tachycardia. The patient is also being monitored for possible pre-renal source of insult and is receiving prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis progression: The patient's sepsis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Acute Renal Failure progression: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Post-operative bleeding: The patient's ureteral stent replacement and lithotripsy may lead to post-operative bleeding, which could worsen her condition.
4. Infection: The patient's urinary source of sepsis may lead to infection, which could spread to other parts of her body and worsen her condition.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachycardia and fever may lead to respiratory failure, which could worsen her condition and potentially lead to life-threatening complications.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia and fever may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, which could worsen her condition and potentially lead to life-threatening complications.
7. Thrombosis: The patient's DVT prophylaxis may not be effective, leading to thrombosis, which could worsen her condition and potentially lead to life-threatening complications.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis may not be effective, leading to stress ulcer, which could worsen her condition and potentially lead to life-threatening complications."

   -micro data- GNR in blood from [**5-16**], started cefepime (curbsided ID, if
   decompensates, give meropenem); uro attdg was concerned that patient
   had +bcx after dose of ceftriaxone; however, ID agreed that cefepime
   offers better GNR/pseudomonal coverage than ceftriaxone and was the
   next best antibiotic to use
   -cefepime (pseudomonas) + vanco (enterococcus), stopped Cipro
   -Flaygl (empiric C dif)
   -CT [**Last Name (un) 42**]/pelv- 1. interval placement of ureteral stent, 2. minimal
   residual nephrolithiasis, 3. no evidence of further diverticulitis, 4.
   left adrenal adenoma
   -CXR- there is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels that could
   reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The cardiac silhouette
   appears somewhat more prominent, supporting this diagnosis. There is
   also some increasing opacification at the left base consistent with
   atelectasis and possible small pleural effusion.
   -progressed diet- ADAT
   -wrote for prn nebs for wheezing
   -difficult access for lab draws; consider A-line versus PICC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -micro data- GNR in blood from [**5-16**], started cefepime (curbsided ID, if
   decompensates, give meropenem); uro attdg was concerned that patient
   had +bcx after dose of ceftriaxone; however, ID agreed that cefepime
   offers better GNR/pseudomonal coverage than ceftriaxone and was the
   next best antibiotic to use
   -cefepime (pseudomonas) + vanco (enterococcus), stopped Cipro
   -Flaygl (empiric C dif)
   -CT [**Last Name (un) 42**]/pelv- 1. interval placement of ureteral stent, 2. minimal
   residual nephrolithiasis, 3. no evidence of further diverticulitis, 4.
   left adrenal adenoma
   -CXR- there is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels that could
   reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The cardiac silhouette
   appears somewhat more prominent, supporting this diagnosis. There is
   also some increasing opacification at the left base consistent with
   atelectasis and possible small pleural effusion.
   -progressed diet- ADAT
   -wrote for prn nebs for wheezing
   -difficult access for lab draws; consider A-line versus PICC
   -Urine and blood cx from [**5-16**] growing budding yeast, started on
   fluconazole
   -Started on IV fluids for low bicarb and increasing anion gap

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of DM2, HTN, recent diverticulitis, and nephrolithiasis who presents with fevers, rigors, and tachycardia after lithotripsy and ureteral stent placement. 

The patient has a high fever with rigors, which is concerning for bacterial infection or bacteremia, and the most likely source is the urine, given the positive urine culture. The patient has a history of recent antibiotic treatment, raising concern for C. difficile and now with elevated WBC count, there is a high concern for C. difficile even without diarrhea. 

The patient's WBC count is elevated, and the differential shows a high percentage of neutrophils, which is consistent with an inflammatory response. The patient's creatinine level is increasing, which may be due to pre-renal azotemia or acute kidney injury. 

The patient has a history of hypertension, which is being managed with atenolol, and the patient's blood pressure is within normal limits. The patient's diabetes is being managed with diet and HISS, and the patient is being held on oral antihyperglycemics. 

The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypokalemia, which may be due to diuresis of potassium. The patient's calcium and magnesium levels are normal. 

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 95%, and the patient is not requiring oxygen therapy. The patient's cardiac status is also stable, with a normal cardiac silhouette and no murmurs or rubs appreciated. 

The patient's abdominal examination is normal, with no evidence of tenderness or guarding. The patient's extremities are normal, with no evidence of edema or decreased pulses. 

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated WBC count, with a high percentage of neutrophils, and an elevated creatinine level. The patient's liver function tests are normal, and the patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal. 

The patient's medical plan includes empiric antibiotics with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole for double GNR coverage for potential GU source and now flagyl for C. difficile coverage. The patient will also receive IV hydration and PO hydration overnight, and the patient's electrolyte levels will be closely monitored. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Sepsis: Given the patient's elevated WBC count and positive urine culture, there is a high risk of developing sepsis.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, which may be due to pre-renal azotemia or acute kidney injury.
* C. difficile colitis: Given the patient's history of recent antibiotic treatment and elevated WBC count, there is a high risk of developing C. difficile colitis.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypokalemia, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's SpO2 is 95%, and the patient is not requiring oxygen therapy, but the patient may develop respiratory failure if the patient's condition worsens.
* Cardiac failure: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but the patient may develop cardiac failure if the patient's condition worsens.

Overall, the patient's condition is unstable, and the patient requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment to prevent potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, recent diverticulitis, and nephrolithiasis, who presented with fevers, rigors, and tachycardia after lithotripsy and ureteral stent placement.

The patient has been diagnosed with possible GNR bacteremia and candidemia, likely originating from the urine source given recent manipulation. She has remained afebrile overnight with improvement in her WBC count and subjective improvement.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Leukocytosis (WBC count: 29.9)
* Anion gap metabolic acidosis (bicarbonate: 13 mEq/L, anion gap: 1.7 mg/dL)
* Respiratory alkalosis (pCO2: 26.1 mmHg)
* Elevated creatinine (1.8 mg/dL)
* Hypokalemia (potassium: 3.9 mEq/L)

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* Fever: Possible GNR bacteremia and candidemia
* Low bicarbonate: Anion and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis
* Acute kidney injury (ARF): Pre-renal etiology, resolving with fluids
* Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, likely due to dehydration
* Hypokalemia: Potassium depletion due to diuresis
* Nephrolithiasis: S/p lithotripsy and ureteral stent replacement
* Hypertension: Ongoing management with atenolol
* Diabetes mellitus: Ongoing management with diabetic diet and HISS
* Left adrenal mass: Found incidentally on CT imaging, likely adenoma

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to GNR bacteremia and candidemia
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to anion gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis
* Renal failure due to pre-renal etiology or non-anion gap metabolic acidosis
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to hypokalemia
* Electrolyte imbalances due to fluid and electrolyte management
* Infection due to instrumentation and urinary tract manipulation

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing vancomycin and cefepime for GNR bacteremia and candidemia
* Narrowing antibiotic coverage pending sensitivities
* Re-checking blood and urine cultures
* Managing anion gap metabolic acidosis with IV fluids and electrolyte management
* Monitoring for ARF and adjusting fluid management accordingly
* Continuing antihypertensive therapy with atenolol
* Managing diabetes with diabetic diet and HISS
* Following up with urology recommendations for nephrolithiasis
* Monitoring left adrenal mass for any changes or complications."

   69  yo female admitted with nephrolithiasis and now s/p ureteral stent
   placement and lithotripsy but with concerning evolution of significant
   bacteremia and fungemia with likely urinary source for both.  We have
   maintained reasonable vigilance in terms of evaluation of further
   possible sources with abdominal CT which did not show focal collection
   of GI source of polymicrobial infection.
   1)Sepsis-Reasonable response to fluids to date, no pressors required
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl to continue
   -IVF bolus as needed
   -Consider D/C of flagyl with C. Diff negative
   -Will pursue micafungin in the setting of yeast seen in blood
   -Will follow up sensitivities
   2)Acidosis-She has a component of Anion Gap and Non-Anion Gap acidisos-
   -This may be related in large part to renal failure, diarrhea and NS
   given which all may contribute
   -Will check Lactate and ketones to confirm the above.
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Renal dose meds
   -continue with adequate IVf support

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female admitted to the ICU with sepsis of urinary origin. The patient has a history of nephrolithiasis and underwent ureteral stent placement and lithotripsy. The patient's condition has worsened, with significant bacteremia and fungemia likely originating from the urinary tract.

The patient is currently receiving antibiotics (Vanco, Cefepime, and Flagyl) and antifungal therapy (fluconazole). The patient's acidosis is worsening, with a component of anion gap and non-anion gap acidosis, which may be related to renal failure, diarrhea, and normal saline administration.

The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure, and the medical team is considering renal dose medications and adequate IV fluid support. The patient's stent is in place, and the medical team is monitoring for any signs of worsening kidney function.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Fungal dissemination: The patient's fungemia may lead to fungal dissemination to other parts of the body, including the lungs, brain, and heart.
3. Renal failure progression: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure, requiring dialysis and potentially affecting overall quality of life.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's acidosis and kidney dysfunction may lead to electrolyte imbalances, including hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia.
5. Infection-related complications: The patient's polymicrobial infection may lead to complications such as abscesses, empyema, and septic shock.

The medical team should continue to monitor the patient's condition closely, adjusting antibiotic and antifungal therapy as necessary, and providing supportive care to manage the patient's acidosis, renal failure, and electrolyte imbalances."
