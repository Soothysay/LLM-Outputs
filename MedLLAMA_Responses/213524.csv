   Assessment and Plan
   74 M with dialated cardiomyopathy s/p AICD placement admitted for
   hypovolemic hypotension.
   .
   HYPOTENSION - Multiple potential causes exist for his hypotension.  He
   was well diuresed, coming in 2 lbs over dry weight following 1.5 L
   resuscitation in the ED.  He was also discharged on increased
   beta-blockade.  The absence of p-waves on his EKG raises the
   possibility of atrial-venous asynchrony.  He has reduced cardiac output
   from cardiomyopathy.  He is on chronic steroids and could have a
   component of adrenal insufficiency.  Although he had a recent
   infection, this was treated with broad spectrum antibiotic coverage and
   he has no signs of infection.  No evidence of active ischemia or
   cardiogenic shock.  Lactate is non-specific.  PE unlikely given
   therapeutic INR, but would consider if hypotension persists.
   - hold antihypertensives, would discharge on lower BB dose.
   - no antibiotics for now
   - follow blood, urine, sputum cultures, fever curve, white count.
   - PA and lateral CXR
   - trend lactate
   - wean levophed
   - consider swan-catheter to eval volume status and cardiac function in
   AM
   .
   VENTRICULAR ARRYTHMIA: History of VT in the setting of volume
   overload.  Also, scheduled for ablation on Monday.
   - hold coumadin in preparation for ablation
   - monitor on tele
   - Will make EP aware.
   .
   CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: Was likely at or below dry weight on
   admission, now up 1.5 L.  Elevated BNP, JVP, CVP.
   - will diurese gently with Lasix 60 mg daily.
   .
   COPD: Does not appear to be in acute flair
   - Advair/Spireva/Prednisone
   .
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: On last admission, Cr improved
   initially with lasix and then increased.  Now elevated well over
   baseline.  Urine shows hyaline casts.  FeUrea 35%.  All consistent with
   pre-renal.
   - Watch Cr with rehydration

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy, hypovolemic hypotension, and a recent AICD placement. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 107/74 mmHg, heart rate of 88 bpm, and respiratory rate of 19 inspirations per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on 2L nasal cannula.

The patient's cardiac examination reveals a regular rhythm with a pacemaker, with a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. The patient's lungs are wheezing, and there are scattered crackles throughout.

Laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating myocardial injury, and elevated lactate levels, suggesting possible cardiac dysfunction. The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient's ECG shows NSVT with alternating native and paced beats, which is concerning for ventricular arrhythmia. The patient's chest X-ray shows increased opacity in the left perihilar region, possibly indicating an infiltrate.

The patient's medical plan includes holding antihypertensives, discontinuing antibiotics, and following blood, urine, and sputum cultures. The patient will also undergo a PA and lateral chest X-ray, and his lactate level will be trended.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of VT and the presence of NSVT on ECG increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's dilated cardiomyopathy and elevated troponin-T levels increase the risk of cardiogenic shock.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure and elevated creatinine levels increase the risk of further renal deterioration.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's wheezing and scattered crackles throughout the lungs increase the risk of respiratory failure.
5. Infection: The patient's recent infection and elevated white blood cell count increase the risk of further infection.
6. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's chronic steroid use and elevated cortisol levels increase the risk of adrenal insufficiency.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of dialated cardiomyopathy, admitted to the ICU for hypovolemic hypotension. The patient's condition is complex and multifaceted, with several potential causes for his hypotension, including:

1. Atrial-ventricular asynchrony due to the absence of p-waves on his EKG
2. Reduced cardiac output from cardiomyopathy
3. Adrenal insufficiency due to chronic steroid use
4. Volume depletion from recent diuresis

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin T levels, indicating possible cardiac injury, and elevated lactate levels, which could be indicative of tissue hypoxia or metabolic acidosis.

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Tachycardia with a heart rate of 88 bpm
* Hypotension with a blood pressure of 107/74 mmHg
* Tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 19 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula
* Cardiac examination reveals a regular, irregularly irregular rhythm with a 1-2/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border

The patient's medical history is significant for:

* AICD placement
* Chronic steroid use
* Dialated cardiomyopathy
* Recent infection treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics
* History of VT in the setting of volume overload

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Holding antihypertensives
* Not initiating antibiotics at this time
* Following blood, urine, and sputum cultures, as well as the fever curve and white count
* Trending lactate levels
* Weaning levophed
* Considering a Swan-Ganz catheter to evaluate volume status and cardiac function
* Holding Coumadin in preparation for ablation
* Monitoring on telemetry
* Following X-ray and oxygen requirement
* Repleting fluids as needed for pressure support

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as VT or ventricular fibrillation
* Cardiogenic shock
* Acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease
* Respiratory failure or worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
* Sepsis or septic shock
* Adrenal insufficiency
* Volume overload or congestive heart failure

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan of care accordingly to prevent these potential complications and optimize the patient's outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 M with dialated cardiomyopathy s/p AICD placement admitted for
   hypovolemic hypotension.
   .
   HYPOTENSION - Multiple potential causes exist for his hypotension.  He
   was well diuresed, coming in 2 lbs over dry weight following 1.5 L
   resuscitation in the ED.  He was also discharged on increased
   beta-blockade.  The absence of p-waves on his EKG raises the
   possibility of atrial-venous asynchrony.  He has reduced cardiac output
   from cardiomyopathy.  He is on chronic steroids and could have a
   component of adrenal insufficiency.  Although he had a recent
   infection, this was treated with broad spectrum antibiotic coverage and
   he has no signs of infection.  No evidence of active ischemia or
   cardiogenic shock.  Lactate is non-specific.  PE unlikely given
   therapeutic INR, but would consider if hypotension persists.
   - hold antihypertensives, would discharge on lower BB dose.
   - no antibiotics for now
   - follow blood, urine, sputum cultures, fever curve, white count.
   - PA and lateral CXR
   - trend lactate
   - wean levophed
   - consider swan-catheter to eval volume status and cardiac function in
   AM
   .
   VENTRICULAR ARRYTHMIA: History of VT in the setting of volume
   overload.  Also, scheduled for ablation on Monday.
   - hold coumadin in preparation for ablation
   - monitor on tele
   - Will make EP aware.
   CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: Was likely at or below dry weight on
   admission, now up 1.5 L.  Elevated BNP, JVP, CVP.
   - will diurese gently with Lasix 60 mg daily.
   COPD: Does not appear to be in acute flair
   - Advair/Spireva/Prednisone
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: On last admission, Cr improved
   initially with lasix and then increased.  Now elevated well over
   baseline.  Urine shows hyaline casts.  FeUrea 35%.  All consistent with
   pre-renal.
   - Watch Cr with rehydration
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Resolved on admission to CCU following fluid
   resuscitation with falling lactate.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of dialated cardiomyopathy, who was admitted to the ICU for hypovolemic hypotension. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.3°C, heart rate 90 bpm, blood pressure 99/61 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation 96%.
* Cardiac status: The patient has a history of VT and is scheduled for ablation on Monday. He is currently being monitored on tele and will be made aware of his condition to the EP.
* Respiratory status: The patient has COPD and is being treated with Advair/Spireva/Prednisone.
* Renal status: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, with elevated creatinine levels and hyaline casts in his urine.
* Fluid status: The patient is currently 1.5 liters over his dry weight and is being diuresed with Lasix 60 mg daily.
* Laboratory results: The patient's troponin-T level is 0.02 ng/mL, and his lactate level is 0.9 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's history of VT and scheduled ablation on Monday increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and potentially life-threatening complications.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's COPD and respiratory rate of 20 inspirations per minute increase the risk of respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
* Renal complications: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure and elevated creatinine levels increase the risk of further kidney damage and potentially life-threatening complications.
* Fluid overload: The patient's current fluid status, being 1.5 liters over his dry weight, increases the risk of fluid overload and potentially life-threatening complications.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, the following plan should be implemented:

* Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and be prepared to intervene if any arrhythmias occur.
* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and be prepared to intervene if any respiratory failure occurs.
* Monitor the patient's renal status closely and be prepared to intervene if any further kidney damage occurs.
* Continue to diuresed the patient with Lasix 60 mg daily to help reduce fluid overload.
* Consider inserting a Swan-Ganz catheter to evaluate the patient's volume status and cardiac function.
* Consider weaning the patient off levophed and increasing the dose of beta-blocker to help reduce blood pressure.
* Continue to monitor the patient's lactate level and be prepared to intervene if it increases further."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU for hypovolemic hypotension secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy and AICD placement.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 99/61 mmHg. He is receiving fluids and diuretics to manage his hypotension and volume overload.

The patient's cardiac status is concerning, with a reduced ejection fraction of 15% and mild mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension. His cardiac rhythm is ventricular-paced, and he has a 1-2/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. His lung examination reveals wheezes, but otherwise, his lungs are clear.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, mild thrombocytopenia, and elevated creatinine and lactate levels. His troponin-T level is elevated, indicating cardiac injury.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of ventricular tachycardia and the presence of a ventricular-paced rhythm increase his risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Heart failure: The patient's dilated cardiomyopathy and pulmonary hypertension increase his risk of heart failure, which can lead to worsening respiratory and cardiac status.
3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and lactate levels indicate potential kidney damage, which can worsen his overall condition.
4. Sepsis: The patient's history of hypotension and his current respiratory status increase his risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure.
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient's thrombocytopenia and his history of atrial fibrillation increase his risk of developing thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary embolism or stroke.

Based on these findings, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his cardiac, respiratory, and renal status. He should be continued on diuretics and vasopressors as needed to manage his hypotension and volume overload. His cardiac rhythm should be monitored closely, and he should be considered for cardiac ablation if his ventricular tachycardia persists."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypovolemic hypotension and a history of ventricular arrhythmia. He has a diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy and was recently placed with an Automatic Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (AICD). The patient has been experiencing ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ectopy. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, and blood pressure of 99/61 mmHg. He has a history of allergies to several medications and has been receiving various treatments for his conditions, including digoxin, mexiletine, and Lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventricular Arrhythmia: The patient's history of VT and ectopy increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
2. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy and his history of volume overload increase the risk of congestive heart failure, which can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs and other organs.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's history of acute on chronic renal failure increases the risk of acute kidney injury, which can lead to further renal damage and the need for dialysis.
4. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient's history of anion gap acidosis increases the risk of acid-base disturbances, which can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular complications.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's diagnosis of COPD increases the risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to the need for mechanical ventilation.
6. Sepsis: The patient's history of multiple antibiotics and his diagnosis of acute on chronic renal failure increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust his medication regimen as needed to prevent further ventricular arrhythmias.
2. Continue to manage the patient's congestive heart failure with diuretics and other medications, and monitor his fluid status closely.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his medication regimen as needed to prevent further acute kidney injury.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's acid-base status and adjust his medication regimen as needed to prevent further acid-base disturbances.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his medication regimen as needed to prevent further respiratory failure.
6. Consider adding prophylactic antibiotics to the patient's regimen to prevent sepsis."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypotension and lightheadedness. He has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and was admitted for hypovolemic hypotension.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 99/61 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia and is scheduled for ablation on Monday. He is currently on medications including digoxin, mexiletine, Lopressor, losartan, omeprazole, colace, and prednisone.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.3, hemoglobin of 11.0 g/dL, platelet count of 183 K/uL, and creatinine of 2.5 mg/dL. His troponin-T level is 0.02 ng/mL, and his lactate level is 0.9 mmol/L.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypotension: Resolved. The patient's blood pressure is occasionally in the 70s on Lasix, and the medication has been discontinued.
* Ventricular arrhythmia: The patient has a history of VT in the setting of volume overload. Ablation is scheduled for Monday.
* Congestive heart failure: The patient's condition is stable, and he will start taking oral Lasix to achieve a goal of even fluid balance.
* COPD: The patient's condition does not appear to be in acute flair, and he is being treated with Advair, Spiriva, and prednisone. Xopenex will be added.
* Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's condition is improving, and he will be monitored for changes in his creatinine level.
* Anion gap acidosis: The patient's condition has resolved since admission to the CCU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Ventricular arrhythmia: The patient's history of VT and scheduled ablation increase his risk of arrhythmia complications.
* Congestive heart failure: The patient's condition is stable, but he is at risk of exacerbation if his fluid balance is not maintained.
* Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's condition is improving, but he is at risk of further deterioration if his creatinine level increases.
* Anion gap acidosis: The patient's condition has resolved, but he is at risk of recurrence if his acid-base balance is not maintained.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD and potential for respiratory decompensation increase his risk of respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient's history of antibiotic use and potential for infection increase his risk of sepsis.
* Cardiac tamponade: The patient's history of VT and scheduled ablation increase his risk of cardiac tamponade."

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Patient Information**

* Age: 74 years old
* Sex: Male
* Admission diagnosis: Hypovolemic hypotension
* Current diagnosis: Ventricular arrhythmia, dilated cardiomyopathy, acute on chronic renal failure, anion gap acidosis, and congestive heart failure

**Vital Signs**

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* Heart rate: 81 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 99/61 mmHg (70/42-104/72 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 29 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Weight: 90.4 kg (admission weight)

**Lab Results**

* White blood cell count: 8.3-10.6 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.8-10.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 150-183 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.7-2.5 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.02-<0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 88-156 mg/dL
* Other lab results: see below

**Potential Medical Complications**

1. Ventricular arrhythmia: The patient's history of VT in the setting of volume overload and ongoing VT and ectopy increase the risk of further arrhythmia complications.
2. Congestive heart failure: The patient's diagnosis of CHF and ongoing fluid management increase the risk of further fluid overload and worsening heart failure.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function and increased creatinine levels increase the risk of further renal failure and potential need for dialysis.
4. Anion gap acidosis: The patient's resolved anion gap acidosis on admission to CCU increases the risk of further acidosis if fluid resuscitation is inadequate.
5. Hypovolemic hypotension: The patient's ongoing hypotension increases the risk of further hypovolemia and potential need for vasopressors.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's COPD diagnosis and ongoing respiratory support increase the risk of further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of diarrhea and ongoing use of medications that can cause gastrointestinal side effects (e.g., metronidazole) increase the risk of further gastrointestinal complications, such as Clostridioides difficile infection.

**Plan**

* Continue digoxin and increase Mexiletine to 200mg TID
* Hold coumadin for now, restart if no plans for procedure
* Monitor on tele
* Continue Lopressor 25mg and Losartan 12.5mg
* Continue po Lasix, goal even
* Add Xopenex for COPD
* Watch Cr, has been improving
* Prophylaxis: therapeutic INR, Colase & Senna, add SQ heparin if INR < 2

**IV Access**

* Temporary central access (ICU) Location: Right Internal Jugular
* Order date: [**11-17**] @ 2105"
