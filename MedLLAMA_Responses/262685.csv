   Ms. [**Known lastname 7854**] is a 20 year old previously healthy female admitted to the
   MICU for hypoxia, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and fever.
   .
   # Fever/Bandemia/tachycardia: Meets criteria for sepsis.  Patient
   received an additional 3L of IVF overnight. Presumptive diagnosis is
   Lemierre
s given the h/o severe sore throat and neck pain followed by
   hypoxia as well as the CT chest c/w septic emboli in setting of growing
   anaerobic GNRs at the OSH. However, the CT of the neck was negative for
   thrombophlebitis although this is only positive in 30-40% of cases.
   Other potential sources include an abdominal source given her original
   presentation including abdominal pain and concern for an acute abdomen.
   Potential alternatives include bacterial pneumonia/CAP, atypical
   pneumonia, although these are less likely.  TTE showed no vegetations,
   ruling out endocarditis as a source of septic emboli.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 20-year-old female admitted to the MICU for hypoxia, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and fever. She has a history of severe sore throat and neck pain followed by hypoxia, and a CT chest showed septic emboli. The presumptive diagnosis is Lemierre syndrome. She received 3L of IV fluid overnight and is currently receiving oxygen via nasal cannula. She has diffuse crackles on lung examination, mild mitral valve prolapse, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension on echocardiogram. Her laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. She has also been treated with antibiotics and is being monitored for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's diagnosis of Lemierre syndrome and her laboratory results indicate that she may be at risk for sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and diffuse crackles on lung examination suggest that she may be at risk for respiratory failure.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's mild mitral valve prolapse and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension on echocardiogram suggest that she may be at risk for cardiovascular complications.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's laboratory results show coagulopathy, which may increase her risk for bleeding complications.
5. Infection: The patient's diagnosis of Lemierre syndrome and her laboratory results suggest that she may be at risk for infection.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's laboratory results show thrombocytopenia, which may increase her risk for bleeding complications.
7. Anemia: The patient's laboratory results show anemia, which may increase her risk for fatigue and weakness.
8. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's laboratory results show hyperbilirubinemia, which may increase her risk for liver damage.

Overall, the patient is at risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 20-year-old female, is admitted to the MICU for hypoxia, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and fever. She has a history of severe sore throat and neck pain, and a CT chest shows septic emboli. The patient is suspected to have Lemierre's syndrome, but other potential sources of infection include abdominal, pulmonary, and extrapulmonary sources. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, and further testing is being conducted to determine the source of the infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and bandemia indicate a high risk of sepsis. If not managed promptly, sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction, failure, and death.
2. Lemierre's Syndrome: The patient's symptoms are consistent with Lemierre's syndrome, a life-threatening infection caused by anaerobic bacteria. If left untreated, Lemierre's syndrome can lead to septicemia, pneumonia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be a sign of disseminated intravascular coagulation, which can lead to bleeding complications if not managed promptly.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be a sign of hemolysis, which can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may be a sign of disseminated intravascular coagulation, which can lead to bleeding complications if not managed promptly.
6. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's hypoxia and pulmonary nodules may indicate pulmonary complications such as pneumonia or septic emboli, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed promptly.
7. Abdominal Complications: The patient's abdominal pain and hyperbilirubinemia may indicate abdominal complications such as pancreatitis or cholecystitis, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure if not managed promptly.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's headache and altered mental status may indicate neurological complications such as meningitis or encephalitis, which can lead to permanent brain damage or death if not managed promptly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and antifungals as prescribed.
2. Monitor hemodynamics and adjust IVF boluses as needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 7854**] is a 20 year old previously healthy female admitted to the
   MICU for hypoxia, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and fever.
   .
   # Fever/Bandemia/tachycardia: Meets criteria for SIRS with concern for
   infectious process (i.e. sepsis).  Patient has received a total of 10
   liters of IVF (4L OSH, 6L [**Hospital1 19**] ED) with most recent venous lactate of
   2.1.  Potential sources include bacterial pneumonia/CAP, atypical
   pneumonia including Legionella, MTB or atypical mycobacterium.  IJ
   thrombophlebitis after pharyngitis is also a distinct possibility with
   pulmonary nodules representing septic emboli/developing cavitary
   lesions.  Extra-pulmonary infectious sources including Ehrlichia given
   fever, bandemia, HA, thombocytopenia, anemia, and LFT abnormalities
   especially as patient may have been at risk.  Patient was Influenza A+B
   and monospot negative at OSH. Patient has no risk factors for HIV but
   cannot be ruled out at this time.
   - Monitor hemodynamics (MAP>65, UOP>30 cc/hour) with IVF boluses prn.
   - Recheck venous lactate
   - Levofloxacin and doxycline for CAP, atypical and tick borne
   illnesses. Low threshold to expand coverage if hemodynamically
   unstable.
   - Follow-up BCx, final CT read. Can consider bedside U/S to assess for
   IJ thrombus suggestive of thrombophlebitis and starting anaerobic GNR
   coverage (i.e. fusobacterium) coverage with pip/tazo, imipenem, or
   ticarcillin-clav.  If clinical suspicion increases, will order CT neck
   w/ and w/o contrast.
   - Given possibility of septic emboli, will also check TTE. No murmurs
   on exam. Low threshold for expanding coverage.
   - Check Legionella urinary antigen, Ehrlichia and lyme serologies,
   thick and thin smear
   - Recheck monospot, EBV serology
   - Follow-up OSH culture data
   - Repeat BCx
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient with new oxygen requirement with abnormal CTA chest
   demonstrating scattered ground glass opacities and pulmonary nodules
   versus septic emboli with concern for cavitary RUL lesion.  Given
   overall clinical picture, infectious process is much more likely,
   although non-infectious etiologies including nodular sarcoid are on the
   differential.
   - Negative pressure isolation for now.
   - Cover for CAP and atypical pna with levofloxacin.
   - Check ABG
   - Follow-up final CTA chest read. Will need to consider MTB and
   atypical mycobacterium rule out with induced sputum x3 if read
   continues as cavitary.  Will also need to consider alternative
   diagnoses for cavitary lesion including fungal (Aspergillosis, Cocci,
   Histo) or malignancy.
   .
   # Abdominal pain/Hyperbilirubinemia: Mixed direct and indirect
   hyperbilirubinemia.  Repeat RUQ U/S negative for acute biliary
   process.
   - Serial abdominal exams
   - Trend hyperbili, check hemolysis labs.
   - Follow-up final CT read to r/o appendicitis.
   - Supportive care, analgesia prn.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Smear negative for
   schistocytes, although coagulopathy, anemia, and thrombocytopenia
   somewhat concerning for DIC, consumptive coagulopathy, or hemolysis.
   As above, would also consider Parvo B19 on the differential although
   this does not explain hypoxia.
   - Trend counts
   - Check hemolysis labs
   - Iron studies
   - Call PCP in AM to determine baseline hematocrit and platelet as well
   as past hemoglobin electrophoresis.
   - Consider hemoglobin electrophoresis given family history of
   thalassemia
   .
   # HA: LP negative for bacterial or viral meningitis.
   - Acetaminophen prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 20-year-old female, is admitted to the MICU with hypoxia, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and fever. The patient has a presumptive diagnosis of Lemierre's syndrome given the history of severe sore throat and neck pain followed by hypoxia, and the CT chest showing septic emboli in the setting of growing anaerobic Gram-negative rods at the OSH.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.5°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, and blood pressure of 100/51 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has an SpO2 of 96%. The patient's respiratory support includes a 5-6L nasal cannula, which has improved their oxygen saturation to 98% after receiving another dose of Lasix.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.0 K/μL, hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL, platelet count of 94 K/μL, and a lactate level of 1.5 mmol/L. The patient's differential shows 80% polys without bands.

The patient's medical conditions include fever, bandemia, tachycardia, hypoxia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and coagulopathy. The patient's laboratory results suggest a possible diagnosis of Lemierre's syndrome, and the patient is being treated with Zosyn and Lasix.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's diagnosis of Lemierre's syndrome puts them at risk for developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and respiratory distress require close monitoring and treatment to prevent respiratory failure.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia increases their risk for bleeding complications, such as petechiae, ecchymoses, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy increases their risk for bleeding complications, such as petechiae, ecchymoses, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia increases their risk for fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased exercise tolerance.
6. Infection: The patient's diagnosis of Lemierre's syndrome increases their risk for developing secondary infections, such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections.
7. Organ dysfunction: The patient's diagnosis of Lemierre's syndrome increases their risk for developing organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury and liver dysfunction.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue Zosyn 4.5mg q6h for presumptive diagnosis of Lemierre's syndrome.
2. Monitor hemodynamics, including MAP and UOP, to ensure adequate perfusion and prevent organ dysfunction.
3. Continue Lasix 10mg IV PRN to manage respiratory distress and hypoxia.
4. Follow up blood cultures to monitor for growth and sensitivities.
5. Continue doxycycline for possible atypical pneumonia or tick-borne illness.
6. Follow up EBV serologies, Lyme serology, Ehrlichia serologies, and babesiosis serologies to determine the cause of the patient's illness.
7. Monitor the patient's abdominal pain and hyperbilirubinemia, and provide supportive care and analgesia as needed.
8. Trend the patient's platelet count and hemoglobin levels to monitor for signs of bleeding or anemia.
9. Provide supportive care, including nutrition and glycemic control, as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 20-year-old female admitted to the MICU for hypoxia, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and fever. The patient's condition has been stable, with improving oxygen saturation and decreasing lung infiltrates on CXR. The patient is receiving antibiotics, Lasix, and other medications as needed.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient meets criteria for sepsis, and ongoing low-grade fevers may indicate a persistent infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen requirements are increasing, and the CXR shows scattered ground glass opacities and pulmonary nodules, which may indicate ongoing lung damage.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is still decreasing, and the smear is negative for schistocytes, which may indicate a hemolytic process.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, and the fibrinogen level is decreased, which may indicate a bleeding tendency.
5. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain is persistent, and the RUQ U/S is negative for acute biliary process, which may indicate a different etiology.
6. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's bilirubin level is elevated, and the smear is negative for schistocytes, which may indicate a hemolytic process.
7. Thalassemia: The patient's Hb electrophoresis is pending, but the high suspicion for thalassemia may indicate a genetic disorder.
8. Meningitis: The patient's LP is negative for bacterial or viral meningitis, but the patient's symptoms may indicate a different etiology.
9. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheters.
10. VAP: The patient is at risk for VAP due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's ongoing care should focus on managing these potential complications, including continued antibiotic therapy, Lasix, and other medications as needed. The patient's oxygen requirements should be closely monitored, and the CXR should be repeated to assess for any changes in lung infiltrates. The patient's platelet count and INR should be closely monitored, and the patient should be counseled on the importance of blood transfusions if necessary. The patient's abdominal pain should be managed with analgesia and supportive care, and the patient's bilirubin level should be monitored for any signs of hemolysis. The patient's Hb electrophoresis should be repeated to confirm or rule out thalassemia, and the patient's LP should be repeated to rule out meningitis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following is a summary of the patient's health status:

The patient is a 20-year-old previously healthy female admitted to the MICU for hypoxia, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and fever. She has a presumptive diagnosis of Lemierre's syndrome given her history of severe sore throat and neck pain followed by hypoxia, as well as the CT chest showing septic emboli in the setting of growing anaerobic GNRs (Fusobacterium) at the OSH.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.5°C (101.3°F)
* Heart rate: 106 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 100/51 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 35 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: MAP > 65 mmHg, UOP > 30 cc/hour

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC count: 8.0 K/uL
* Hct: 25.6%
* Platelet count: 94 K/uL
* Cr: 0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 94 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 15.0/29.4/1.3, ALT/AST: 32/51, Alk Phos/T Bili: 98/2.4, Amylase/Lipase: 19/10, Differential-Neuts: 79.1%, Lymph: 16.8%, Mono: 3.5%, Eos: 0.3%, D-dimer: 4611 ng/mL, Fibrinogen: 817 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 1.5 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.8 g/dL, LDH: 197 IU/L, Ca++: 8.3 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.5 mg/dL, PO4: 2.7 mg/dL

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuing Zosyn 4.5mg q6h
* Asking ID about stopping doxycycline and eventual switch to PO Flagyl or PICC
* Monitoring hemodynamics (MAP > 65, UOP > 30 cc/hour)
* Continuing Lasix 10mg IV PRN, goal TBV -1L
* Following blood cultures
* Following OSH lab results
* Following EBV serologies, Lyme serologies, Ehrlichia serologies, and babesiosis serologies

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Hemorrhagic complications due to thrombocytopenia
* Abdominal pain and hyperbilirubinemia
* Coagulopathy
* Hemolytic anemia
* Meningitis
* Pneumonia
* VAP
* DVT
* Stress ulcer bleeding
* Gastrointestinal bleeding

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and treatment response to prevent or manage these potential complications."
