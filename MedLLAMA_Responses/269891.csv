   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 20 year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety
   and recent initiation of antipsychotic medications presenting with
   increasing paranoia, fevers and stiffness.
   .
   Plan:
   # Fever, rigitidy: Patient remained afebrile overnight and his rigidity
   has improved with ativan. Initial presentation concerning for NMS-
   fever, rigidity, tachycardia and elevated BP, and mental status
   changes, namely catatonia/mutism and paranoia. These have largely
   improved. CK have remained stable, LDH increased. Malignant catatonia,
   a psychiatric diagnosis, also presents in this manner. Patient has no
   signs of meningitis on exam, TSH is normal, which make infection and
   thyrotoxicosis less likely. Per psychiatry patients with low serum iron
   studies have worse prognosis in NMS; patient is slightly anemic.
   - IV NS@ 150cc/hr
   - Trend CK, lactate
   - Ativan 0.5-1mg PO q3, 1mg PO PRN and 1mg IV PRN
   - EKG q6h
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   .
   # Paranoia
 Improved since admission with benzo. Will touch base with
   psychiatry prior to transfer/discharge to ensure appropriate follow-up
   and recommendations regarding psych medications. Given patient's
   discontinued use of marijuana this could be due to withdrawal vs. new
   onset schizophrenia (increased risk given first degree relative with
   diagnosis)vs. malignant catatonia. Unlikely to be drug related given
   patient's toxicology is negative. Also unlikely is a primary CNS
   mass/hemorrhage given negative CT.
   -treat as above with benzos, avoid neuroleptics
   -f/u any new psych recommendations
   -psych consult
   # Leukocytosis - Most concerning for infection, given fever and
   tachycardia. Blood and urine cultures were taken in the ED and are
   pending. The patient does not present with any meningeal signs on exam.
   Will continue to monitor his mental status, fever curve and WBC for
   indications of meningitis. He also has a new murmur on exam which has
   not been documented previously.
   -repeat CBC
   -f/u pending cultures
   -ETT to work-up new murmur on exam
   # Asthma - currently stable on exam. Patient taking his own
   albuterol/fluticasone IH.
   .
   # Eczema- restart outpatient topical creams.
   # FEN: IV NS@150cc/hr, monitor electrolytes closely, regular diet as
   tolerated

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 20-year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety, and recent initiation of antipsychotic medications, presenting with increasing paranoia, fevers, and stiffness. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has received various medications, including antibiotics, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 105 bpm, and blood pressure of 136/63 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 100% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, with a peak of 13.1 K/uL, and an increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. His creatine kinase (CK) levels have remained stable, and his troponin-T level is normal. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low serum iron level.

The patient's physical examination reveals a guarded demeanor, with increased tone in the right leg and normal tone in the upper extremities. He has eczema patches on his arms and legs. His neurologic examination shows poor eye contact, soft voice, and increased tone in the right leg.

The patient's condition is being managed with IV fluids, antibiotics, and benzodiazepines. He is also receiving antipsychotic medications to manage his paranoia and agitation.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest the possibility of an underlying infection, which needs to be ruled out through further laboratory tests and imaging studies.
2. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS): The patient's symptoms, including fever, rigidity, and elevated CK levels, are consistent with NMS. However, the patient's response to benzodiazepines suggests that this may not be the primary diagnosis.
3. Malignant catatonia: The patient's symptoms, including catatonia, mutism, and paranoia, are consistent with malignant catatonia. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's response to benzodiazepines and the absence of other underlying causes.
4. Psychiatric complications: The patient's recent initiation of antipsychotic medications and his history of anxiety and asthma may increase his risk of developing psychiatric complications, such as psychosis or depression.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's new murmur on examination suggests the possibility of underlying cardiovascular disease, which needs to be further evaluated.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex and requires careful management to prevent potential medical complications. Further laboratory tests and imaging studies are needed to rule out underlying infections and cardiovascular disease. The patient's psychiatric symptoms require ongoing management with benzodiazepines and antipsychotic medications."

   # Fever, rigitidy: Patient remained afebrile overnight and his rigidity
   has improved with ativan. Initial presentation concerning for NMS-
   fever, rigidity, tachycardia and elevated BP, and mental status
   changes, namely catatonia/mutism and paranoia. These have largely
   improved. CK have remained stable, LDH increased. Malignant catatonia,
   a psychiatric diagnosis, also presents in this manner. Patient has no
   signs of meningitis on exam, TSH is normal, which make infection and

Summary:

The patient is a 20-year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety, and recent initiation of antipsychotic medications, presenting with increasing paranoia, fevers, and stiffness. He has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management. Overnight, he had several episodes of tachycardia, but his EKG remained unchanged. His vital signs have stabilized, and his rigidity has improved with Ativan. His CK levels have remained stable, and LDH has increased. He has no signs of meningitis on exam, and his TSH is normal, making infection and thyrotoxicosis less likely.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's fever and tachycardia may indicate an underlying infection, and blood and urine cultures are pending. Monitoring his mental status, fever curve, and WBC count is essential to rule out meningitis.
2. Malignant Catatonia: The patient's presentation, including fever, rigidity, tachycardia, and mental status changes, is concerning for malignant catatonia. His low serum iron studies may indicate a worse prognosis.
3. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): The patient's recent initiation of antipsychotic medications and his presentation raise concerns for NMS. His CK levels have remained stable, but LDH has increased, which may indicate ongoing muscle damage.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's new murmur on exam requires further evaluation, and an ETT is planned to work up this finding.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's asthma is currently stable, but close monitoring is necessary to ensure continued stability.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's IV fluids and medications require close monitoring to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's recent use of marijuana and his presentation raise concerns for gastrointestinal complications, including pancreatitis or bowel obstruction."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with an unknown allergy to aspirin. The patient has received infusions of lorazepam (Ativan) and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.5°C (97.7°F)
* Heart rate: 105 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 136/63 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient has received a total of 1,800 mL of fluids over the past 24 hours, with a net balance of -1,440 mL. The patient has also received blood products, with a total out of 1,890 mL.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 12.6 K/uL (increased)
* Hemoglobin: 13.3 g/dL (normal)
* Platelet count: 327 K/uL (decreased)
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL (normal)
* Blood glucose: 79 mg/dL (normal)
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 13.3/27.2/1.1, CK / CKMB / Troponin-T: 103//, LDH: 281 IU/L, Ca++: 9.5 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL, PO4: 3.5 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the lack of assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Septic shock due to the patient's elevated white blood cell count and platelet count.
2. Acute kidney injury due to the patient's decreased urine output and increased creatinine levels.
3. Respiratory failure due to the patient's tachypnea and decreased oxygen saturation.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's sinus tachycardia and elevated troponin-T levels.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to the patient's immobility and risk factors.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation.

The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status and disposition are also documented."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 20 year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety
   and recent initiation of antipsychotic medications presenting with
   increasing paranoia, fevers and stiffness.
   .
   Plan:
   # Fever, rigitidy: Patient remained afebrile overnight and his rigidity
   has improved with ativan. Initial presentation concerning for NMS-
   fever, rigidity, tachycardia and elevated BP, and mental status
   changes, namely catatonia/mutism and paranoia. These have largely
   improved. CK have remained stable, LDH increased. Malignant catatonia,
   a psychiatric diagnosis, also presents in this manner. Patient has no
   signs of meningitis on exam, TSH is normal, which make infection and
   thyrotoxicosis less likely. Per psychiatry patients with low serum iron
   studies have worse prognosis in NMS; patient is slightly anemic.
   - continue IV NS@ 100cc/hr
   - Trend CK, lactate
   - Ativan 2mg IV, would switch to PO today and decrease to [**Hospital1 **]
   - EKG q6h
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   .
   # Paranoia
 Improved significantly since admission. Will touch base
   with psychiatry prior to transfer/discharge to ensure appropriate
   follow-up and recommendations regarding psych medications. Given
   patient's discontinued use of marijuana this could be due to withdrawal
   vs. new onset schizophrenia (increased risk given first degree relative
   with diagnosis)vs. malignant catatonia. Unlikely to be drug related
   given patient's toxicology is negative. Also unlikely is a primary CNS
   mass/hemorrhage given negative CT.
   -treat as above with benzos, avoid neuroleptics
   -f/u any new psych recommendations
   -psych consult
   # Leukocytosis - Most concerning for infection, given fever and
   tachycardia. Blood and urine cultures were taken in the ED and are
   pending. The patient does not present with any meningeal signs on exam.
   Will continue to monitor his mental status, fever curve and WBC for
   indications of meningitis. He also has a new murmur on exam which has
   not been documented previously.
   -repeat CBC
   -f/u pending cultures
   -ETT to work-up new murmur on exam
   # Asthma - currently stable on exam. Would hold off giving albuterol
   standing as pt is still tachycardic.
   # FEN: IV NS@100cc/hr, monitor electrolytes closely, regular diet as
   tolerated
   .
   # Access: PIV
   .
   # PPx:  heparin SC

   # Code:  presumed full

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   a psychiatric diagnosis, also presents in this manner. Patient has no
   signs of meningitis on exam, TSH is normal, which make infection and
   thyrotoxicosis less likely. Per psychiatry patients with low serum iron
   studies have worse prognosis in NMS; patient is slightly anemic.
   - continue IV NS@ 100cc/hr
   - Trend CK, lactate
   - Ativan 2mg IV, would switch to PO today and decrease to [**Hospital1 **]
   - EKG q6h
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   .
   # Paranoia
 Improved significantly since admission. Will touch base
   with psychiatry prior to transfer/discharge to ensure appropriate
   follow-up and recommendations regarding psych medications. Given
   patient's discontinued use of marijuana this could be due to withdrawal
   vs. new onset schizophrenia (increased risk given first degree relative
   with diagnosis)vs. malignant catatonia. Unlikely to be drug related
   given patient's toxicology is negative. Also unlikely is a primary CNS
   mass/hemorrhage given negative CT.
   -treat as above with benzos, avoid neuroleptics
   -f/u any new psych recommendations
   -psych consult
   # Leukocytosis - Most concerning for infection, given fever and
   tachycardia. Blood and urine cultures were taken in the ED and are
   pending. The patient does not present with any meningeal signs on exam.
   Will continue to monitor his mental status, fever curve and WBC for
   indications of meningitis. He also has a new murmur on exam which has
   not been documented previously.
   -repeat CBC
   -f/u pending cultures
   -ETT to work-up new murmur on exam
   # Asthma - currently stable on exam. Would hold off giving albuterol
   standing as pt is still tachycardic.

Summary:

The patient is a 20-year-old male admitted to the ICU with increasing paranoia, fevers, and stiffness. He has a history of asthma, anxiety, and recent initiation of antipsychotic medications. He presented with tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and mental status changes, including catatonia and paranoia. His condition has improved overnight, with his fever and rigidity decreasing, but his CK levels remain stable, and LDH levels have increased. He has a new murmur on exam, and his WBC count is elevated. The patient's allergies include aspirin, and he is currently receiving IV NS at 100cc/hr.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and fever suggest the possibility of infection. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and the patient's mental status, fever curve, and WBC count will be closely monitored for indications of meningitis.
2. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): The patient's initial presentation was concerning for NMS, and although his condition has improved, his CK levels remain stable, and LDH levels have increased. He is at risk for NMS due to his history of antipsychotic medication use.
3. Malignant Catatonia: The patient's presentation is also concerning for malignant catatonia, a psychiatric diagnosis that can present with fever, rigidity, and mental status changes.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's new murmur on exam and elevated blood pressure suggest the possibility of cardiac complications, such as cardiomyopathy or valvular disease.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's history of asthma and tachycardia suggest the possibility of respiratory complications, such as bronchospasm or respiratory failure.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's elevated LDH levels and possible infection suggest the possibility of gastrointestinal complications, such as pancreatitis or cholecystitis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IV NS at 100cc/hr and monitor electrolytes closely.
2. Repeat CBC and follow up on pending cultures.
3. ETT to work up new murmur on exam.
4. Hold off on giving albuterol standing until the patient's tachycardia resolves.
5. Monitor the patient's mental status, fever curve, and WBC count for indications of meningitis.
6. Consider consulting psychiatry to rule out malignant catatonia and to discuss psych medication recommendations.
7. Consider consulting cardiology to rule out cardiac complications.
8. Consider consulting gastroenterology to rule out gastrointestinal complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a complex medical history. Over the past 24 hours, their vital signs have remained stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 105 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 136/63 mmHg. Respiratory support is not required, and their oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. The patient has received various medications, including lorazepam, and has undergone multiple infusions.

Lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (12.6-13.1 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin (13.3 g/dL), and increased creatinine (0.8-0.7 mg/dL). The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hypokalemia (23 mEq/L), hypomagnesemia (0.7 mg/dL), and hypophosphatemia (4.1 mEq/L). The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and abnormal lab results suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's decreased hemoglobin and increased creatinine levels indicate potential kidney damage, which can worsen if not addressed promptly.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications if not corrected.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged PT and aPTT may indicate a bleeding risk, which can be exacerbated by the patient's critical illness.
5. Respiratory failure: Although the patient is not currently receiving respiratory support, their underlying condition may still put them at risk for respiratory failure, particularly if their oxygen saturation drops or they develop a respiratory infection.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and abnormal blood pressure readings may indicate cardiovascular instability, which can worsen if not managed promptly.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's abnormal lab results and medication regimen may increase their risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
8. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's risk factors, including their critical illness and immobility, make them susceptible to VTE, which can lead to serious complications if not prevented or treated promptly."

   Assessment and Plan
   23 year old male with asthma, eczema, recent development of anxiety and
   paranoia.
   Worsening paranoia after Seroquel, in combintation with rigid muscle
   tone, fevers, elevated BP's concerning for neuroleptic malignant
   syndrome vs malignant catatonia.
   Throughout the night, he has had intermittent worsening of increased
   tone/tachycardia despite scheduled Ativan. Recurrence at 4 am after
   getting 10 pm dose suggests that Ativan needs to be dosed in shorter
   intervals. Other measures such as CK's, fevers, QT by EKG have not been
   concerning.
   Plan:
   *Change to Ativan 2 mgIV or po Q6h and also q2 h prn
   *Increase volume resuscitation to 150 cc/hour
   *Continue monitoring of ECG's and lactate
   *Psych continuing to follow

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 23-year-old male with a history of asthma, eczema, and recent development of anxiety and paranoia. He was started on Seroquel, which led to worsening paranoia and rigidity, with fevers and elevated blood pressure, concerning for neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or malignant catatonia.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Heart rate: 126 bpm
* Blood pressure: 143/60 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 44 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Increased rigidity, particularly in the lower extremities
* Warm skin with no signs of jaundice or cyanosis
* No muscle wasting or weakness
* No signs of respiratory distress

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 13.3 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 12.6 K/uL
* Platelet count: 327 K/uL
* Creatine kinase (CK): 103 IU/L
* Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 281 IU/L
* Calcium: 9.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.5 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Changing Ativan to 2 mg IV or PO every 6 hours, with additional doses as needed
* Increasing volume resuscitation to 150 cc/hour
* Continuing monitoring of ECGs and lactate
* Psychiatric follow-up
* Continuing to follow cultures and echocardiogram

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS): a life-threatening condition characterized by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, and autonomic instability
* Malignant catatonia: a psychiatric emergency characterized by catatonic behavior, rigidity, and autonomic instability
* Respiratory failure: due to muscle rigidity and respiratory depression
* Cardiac arrhythmias: due to electrolyte imbalances and tachycardia
* Infection: due to prolonged hospitalization and immunosuppression
* Nutritional deficiencies: due to inadequate nutrition and prolonged hospitalization."

   Assessment and Plan
   20 year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety and recent
   initiation of antipsychotic medications presenting with increasing
   paranoia, fevers and stiffness.
   #. Intermittent tachycardia
   #. Paranoia
   #. Leukocytosis
   #. Asthma
   Plan:
   # Fever, rigitidy: Patient remained afebrile overnight and his rigidity
   has improved with ativan. Initial presentation concerning for NMS-
   fever, rigidity, tachycardia and elevated BP, and mental status
   changes, namely catatonia/mutism and paranoia. These have largely
   improved. CK have remained stable, LDH increased. Malignant catatonia,
   a psychiatric diagnosis, also presents in this manner. Patient has no
   signs of meningitis on exam, TSH is normal, which make infection and
   thyrotoxicosis less likely. Per psychiatry patients with low serum iron
   studies have worse prognosis in NMS; patient is slightly anemic.
   - IV NS@ 150cc/hr
   - Trend CK, lactate
   - Ativan 0.5-1mg PO q3, 1mg PO PRN and 1mg IV PRN
   - EKG q6h
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   .
   # Paranoia
 Improved since admission with benzo. Will touch base with
   psychiatry prior to transfer/discharge to ensure appropriate follow-up
   and recommendations regarding psych medications. Given patient's
   discontinued use of marijuana this could be due to withdrawal vs. new
   onset schizophrenia (increased risk given first degree relative with
   diagnosis)vs. malignant catatonia. Unlikely to be drug related given
   patient's toxicology is negative. Also unlikely is a primary CNS
   mass/hemorrhage given negative CT.
   -treat as above with benzos, avoid neuroleptics
   -f/u any new psych recommendations
   -psych consult
   # Leukocytosis - Most concerning for infection, given fever and
   tachycardia. Blood and urine cultures were taken in the ED and are
   pending. The patient does not present with any meningeal signs on exam.
   Will continue to monitor his mental status, fever curve and WBC for
   indications of meningitis. He also has a new murmur on exam which has
   not been documented previously.
   -repeat CBC
   -f/u pending cultures
   -ETT to work-up new murmur on exam
   # Asthma - currently stable on exam. Patient taking his own
   albuterol/fluticasone IH.
   .
   # Eczema- restart outpatient topical creams.
   # FEN: IV NS@150cc/hr, monitor electrolytes closely, regular diet as
   tolerated
   .
   # Access: PIV
   .
   # PPx:  heparin SC
   .
   # Code:  presumed full
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   20 year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety and recent
   initiation of antipsychotic medications presenting with increasing
   paranoia, fevers and stiffness.
   #. Intermittent tachycardia
   #. Paranoia
   #. Leukocytosis
   #. Asthma
   Plan:
   # Fever, rigitidy: Patient remained afebrile overnight and his rigidity
   has improved with ativan. Initial presentation concerning for NMS-
   fever, rigidity, tachycardia and elevated BP, and mental status
   changes, namely catatonia/mutism and paranoia. These have largely
   improved. CK have remained stable, LDH increased. Malignant catatonia,
   a psychiatric diagnosis, also presents in this manner. Patient has no
   signs of meningitis on exam, TSH is normal, which make infection and
   thyrotoxicosis less likely. Per psychiatry patients with low serum iron
   studies have worse prognosis in NMS; patient is slightly anemic.
   - IV NS@ 150cc/hr
   - Trend CK, lactate
   - Ativan 0.5-1mg PO q3, 1mg PO PRN and 1mg IV PRN
   - EKG q6h
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   .
   # Paranoia
 Improved since admission with benzo. Will touch base with
   psychiatry prior to transfer/discharge to ensure appropriate follow-up
   and recommendations regarding psych medications. Given patient's
   discontinued use of marijuana this could be due to withdrawal vs. new
   onset schizophrenia (increased risk given first degree relative with
   diagnosis)vs. malignant catatonia. Unlikely to be drug related given
   patient's toxicology is negative. Also unlikely is a primary CNS
   mass/hemorrhage given negative CT.
   -treat as above with benzos, avoid neuroleptics
   -f/u any new psych recommendations
   -psych consult
   # Leukocytosis - Most concerning for infection, given fever and
   tachycardia. Blood and urine cultures were taken in the ED and are
   pending. The patient does not present with any meningeal signs on exam.
   Will continue to monitor his mental status, fever curve and WBC for
   indications of meningitis. He also has a new murmur on exam which has
   not been documented previously.
   -repeat CBC
   -f/u pending cultures
   -ETT to work-up new murmur on exam
   # Asthma - currently stable on exam. Patient taking his own
   albuterol/fluticasone IH.
   .
   # Eczema- restart outpatient topical creams.
   # FEN: IV NS@150cc/hr, monitor electrolytes closely, regular diet as
   tolerated

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is a 20-year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety, and recent initiation of antipsychotic medications. He presented with increasing paranoia, fevers, and stiffness. He had intermittent tachycardia, leukocytosis, and a new murmur on exam. His initial presentation was concerning for Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), but his symptoms have largely improved with treatment. He is currently receiving IV fluids, ativan, and monitoring for signs of infection and meningitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen if left untreated. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and the patient's mental status, fever curve, and WBC count should be closely monitored for signs of meningitis.
2. Meningitis: The patient's symptoms could also be indicative of meningitis, which is a life-threatening condition. A CT scan was negative, but a lumbar puncture may be necessary to rule out meningitis.
3. NMS: Although the patient's symptoms have improved, NMS is a serious condition that requires close monitoring. The patient's serum iron studies are slightly low, which may indicate a worse prognosis.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiomyopathy.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's asthma is currently stable, but his respiratory status should be closely monitored for signs of worsening asthma or respiratory failure.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's paranoia and stiffness may indicate neurological complications, such as seizures or encephalitis.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's new murmur on exam may indicate a gastrointestinal bleed or other gastrointestinal complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and treatment for his various medical complications. Further testing, such as a lumbar puncture and imaging studies, may be necessary to rule out underlying infections or other conditions."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of fever, stiffness, and paranoia. The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 98.6°F (37°C)
* Heart rate: 99-161 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 100/56 mmHg (68/53-126/120 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 100% (not on oxygen therapy)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 12.6-13.1 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 12.3 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 311-363 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.7-0.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 55-109 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: normal
* Liver function tests: normal

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their inability to assess certain vital signs and body systems. The patient's neurological examination is also incomplete.

The patient's medical history is significant for allergies to aspirin and unknown substances. The patient has received antibiotics, lorazepam (Ativan), and metoprolol.

The patient's 24-hour events include:

* EKGs at 12:00 PM, 5:48 PM, and 7:45 PM
* Development of tachycardia up to 160 bpm with blood pressure of 160 mmHg, which responded to lorazepam
* Switch from IV to PO lorazepam and increase in dose
* New peripheral IV line placement
* Increase in ativan dose as recommended by psychiatry

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's fever and leukocytosis
* Pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis due to the patient's tachycardia and risk factors for venous thromboembolism
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's tachypnea and risk factors for respiratory failure
* Neurological complications due to the patient's paranoia and incomplete neurological examination
* Infection or abscess formation due to the patient's fever and leukocytosis
* Cardiovascular complications due to the patient's tachycardia and hypertension

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results
* Management of tachycardia and hypertension with medications as needed
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prevention
* Nutrition and glycemic control management
* Frequent assessment and reassessment of the patient's neurological and cardiovascular status."

   Assessment and Plan
   20 year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety and recent
   initiation of antipsychotic medications presenting with increasing
   paranoia, fevers and stiffness.
   #. Intermittent tachycardia
 Sinus tachycardia to 160 last night.
   Unclear etiology.  Per psychiatry, unlikely NMS. Possible malignant
   catatonia which can be associated with autonomic dysfunction. No
   indication of infection. Thyroid function is normal. BUN/creatinine
   does not support that he is dry. Negative tox screen on admission.
   Given beta-blocker last night. As unclear of etiology, will hold off on
   further beta-blocker until hemodynamically unstable.
   -          Continue to monitor on telemetry.
   -          Beta-blocker if tachycardia and hemodynamically unstable.
   -          Ativan standing and prn for anxiety related tachycardia
   -          Encourage good PO intake
   #. Paranoia
 Per psychiatry, patient likely needs to be on
   antipsychotic
 still with paranoia, occasional agitation. Psychiatry
   would like to try Seroquel once again while in hospital
   -          Start Seroquel at low-dose today
   -          Ativan 4mg Q6 standing + Ativan prn with hold parameters
   -          Touch base regarding transfer to psychiatry
   -          Follow-up psychiatry recommendations
   #. Leukocytosis
 Unclear origin. Afebrile since admission to ICU;
   febrile to 100.8 in ED. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures with no
   growth to this point. NMS can be associated with mild leukocytosis;
   unsure if this is the same with malignant catatonia.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 20-year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety, and recent initiation of antipsychotic medications, presenting with increasing paranoia, fevers, and stiffness. He has been admitted to the ICU due to intermittent tachycardia, unclear etiology, and concerns about malignant catatonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, and blood pressure of 100/56 mmHg. He is receiving lorazepam for anxiety and metoprolol for tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Malignant Catatonia: The patient's symptoms, including fever, tachycardia, and paranoia, are concerning for malignant catatonia. This condition can lead to autonomic dysfunction, respiratory failure, and even death if left untreated.
2. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Although the patient's psychiatry team has ruled out NMS, it is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely for signs of NMS, such as increased muscle rigidity, fever, and altered mental status.
3. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and fever could be indicative of an underlying infection. It is crucial to continue monitoring blood, urine, and sputum cultures to rule out any potential infections.
4. Thyroid dysfunction: The patient's normal thyroid function tests do not rule out the possibility of thyroid dysfunction, which can contribute to his symptoms.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium and magnesium, should be closely monitored to ensure that they are within normal ranges.
6. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is concerning, with a negative balance of 1,251 mL. This could lead to hypovolemia, hypotension, and organ dysfunction if not addressed.
7. Respiratory compromise: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, particularly given his history of asthma and potential for malignant catatonia.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and potential for malignant catatonia increase the risk of cardiovascular instability, including arrhythmias and cardiac arrest."
