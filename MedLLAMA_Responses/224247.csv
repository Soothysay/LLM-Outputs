   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 10%
   with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, recently
   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**2123-9-22**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2266**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic on ABG likely from contraction alkolosis
   [**12-21**] overdiuresis and overcompensated resp alkalosis for lactate.
   Elevated lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis
   concerning for sepsis. Source of infection include a mesenteric
   ischemia given his afib that had not been anticoagulated prior to
   admission or HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and AMS.
   Less likely to be PNA given lack of hypoxia on ABG. Cdiff neg x1 this
   admission and no diarrhea currently(which you would also expect with
   mesenteric ischemia). Has not spiked fever yet. Patient transfered to
   [**Hospital1 **] for lower ext pain but ulcers and quite superficial and do not
   appear to be source of infection. Also with leukocytosis and elevated
   dbili should consider cholangitis in differential. Another likely
   possibility is cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion and
   lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.
   -broad spectrum abx with Vanc/Zosyn
   -f/u CXR from admission
   -f/u sputum GS and culture, UA, UCx, BCx
   -dopamine was switched to neo given ectopy.
   -f/u lipase, LFTS
   .
   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**9-23**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**12-21**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. Cardiac
   -hold diuresis
   -would benefit from beta-blocker and ACEI once more medically stable
   -IJ central line placed, consider CVP measurement
   -consider ICD in future if patient stabilizes
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in Afib, likely [**12-21**] to dilated atria and
   MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 368**] old LBBB so hard to interpret for new ischemia but should rule
   it out.
   -monitor on tele
   -would benefit from cardioversion which was planned for today but will
   hold off until medically stable
   -hold rate control given sepsis
   -hold anticoagulation as subratherapeutic INR.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has history of CAD and CABG. No history of CP and
   LBBB makes it difficult to interpret ischemic pattern on EKG.
   -trend CEZ
   -cont asa, hold gemfibrozil and BB
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Had completed 7 day course of Levaquin for pneumonia at
   OSH, please see discussion above for concerns of possible infectious
   etiologies and plan.
   .
   # AMS: Patient's mental status and been normal and AAOx3 prior to this
   morning. Underlying infectious process combinted with lactic acidosis
   and respiratory alkalosis likely contributing. Also, did have a fall
   and hit head two days prior to transfer with normal head CT at the
   time. In setting of supratherapeutic INR, should obtain head CT to rule
   out any evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Also having myoclonic
   jerks which is likely to be toxic-metabolic in nature as elytes are
   within normal limits.
   -correct INR (see below)
   -f/u CT head noncontrast
   -intubated for airway protection
   -monitor elytes
   -treat infection as above
   -hold amytriptiline
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Anticoagulated for Afib. Patient received 7.5
   mg of coumadin while being bridged on heparin and INR became
   supratherapeutic to [**3-24**] on [**9-25**] and both medication were discontinued.
   Unclear etiology but patient may have Vit K consumption [**12-21**] underlying
   bowel ishcemia. DIC less likely given normal platelets and fibrinogen.
   -given [**12-23**] U FFP with get INR<2 prior to central line placement
   -give 10 IV VitK x1 for now
   -trend coags
   .
   # AOCKD: Patient baseline 1.6, now 2.5 in setting of diuresis so likely
   pre-renal. Also possible is ATN is setting of hypoperfusion with low
   CO. Also has history of elevated PSA so BPH and postobstructive is
   possible but patient has foley in place but it has been intermittantly
   clotted.
   -give 1L fluid
   -would like to give acetylcysteine prior to contrast load but may not
   be time.
   -f/u urine lytes
   -f/u UA and UCX
   -in future consider renal ultrasound
   .
   # Transaminitis/hyperbilirubinemia: Has AST, LDH elevated which may be
   [**12-21**] hepatic congestion with low EF. With bili elevated also should
   consider cholangitis.
   -trend LFTS
   -f/u CT abd
   .
   # HTN: Has a history of hypertension but currently hypotensive with
   severe shock.
   -hold BB and monitor
   .
   # HL: Hold gemfibrozil given transaminitis and shock
   .
   # DM: HA1C 7.3 on admission, had episodes of hypoglycemia at OSH so
   holding lantus.
   -cont RISS
   -follow BS, if continuously elevated can resume lantus and low dose
   .
   # Polycythemia: Hct elevated since OSH. Likely [**12-21**] to chronic hypoxia
   and stimulated epo response.
   -monitor for now
   .
   # COPD: Unclear how severe, no PFTs in computer. Satting well on room
   air prior to transfer. Does not appear to be chornic CO2 retainer.
   -hold advair while intubated
   -ipratropium/albuterol nebs
   .
   # LE ulcers/edema: Edema likely [**12-21**] venous insufficiency given multiple
   venous grafts. Otherwise intravascularly dry so unlikely related to
   heart failure. Ulcer differential includes PAD and venous
   insufficiency. Does not appear to be a diabetic ulcer. Vascular
   following.
   -vascular to do peripheral graft survival study when more stable
   -cont wound care
   -cont pneumoboots
   .
   # Hematuria: Apparently started in setting of fall that caused trauma
   to foley.
   -cont CBI(althought it makes urine output difficult to monitor)
   -consider Urology consult if not improving.
   .
   # Anxiety: Apparently started in setting of son's diagnosis of cancer.
   Had been with poor appetite. Patient to be intubated.
   -readdress when more stable
   -hold amytriptilline
   .
   # FEN: patient received 1 L NS, follow and replete [**Hospital1 **] elytes
   .
   # ACCESS: 1PIV and 1EJ
   .
   #PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with supratherapeutic INR

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   of 8. Patient was alkalotic on ABG likely from contraction alkolosis
   [**12-21**] overdiuresis and overcompensated resp alkalosis for lactate.
   Elevated lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis
   concerning for sepsis. Source of infection include a mesenteric
   ischemia given his afib that had not been anticoagulated prior to
   admission or HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and AMS.
   Less likely to be PNA given lack of hypoxia on ABG. Cdiff neg x1 this
   admission and no diarrhea currently(which you would also expect with
   mesenteric ischemia). Has not spiked fever yet. Patient transfered to
   [**Hospital1 **] for lower ext pain but ulcers and quite superficial and do not
   appear to be source of infection. Also with leukocytosis and elevated
   dbili should consider cholangitis in differential. Another likely
   possibility is cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion and
   lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation, who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital with severe sepsis, respiratory arrest, and hypoxia. He has a history of mesenteric ischemia, pulmonary embolism, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was found non-responsive and hypoxic on admission and was intubated for airway protection.

The patient has a supratherapeutic INR and is receiving anticoagulation therapy. He has a history of bleeding and is at risk for bleeding complications. He has a fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis, which are concerning for sepsis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate, elevated creatinine, and elevated liver enzymes, which may indicate liver congestion or cholangitis. His chest X-ray shows no evidence of gross volume overload.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat sepsis
* Vasopressors to support blood pressure
* Cardiac medications to manage atrial fibrillation
* Anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombosis
* Pain management with fentanyl
* Bowel regimen with colace/senna
* VAP bundle
* PPI

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Bleeding complications
* Liver dysfunction
* Kidney dysfunction
* Respiratory failure
* Neurological complications

Recommendations:

* Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat sepsis
* Monitor for signs of sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Manage atrial fibrillation with cardiac medications
* Monitor for bleeding complications and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary
* Monitor liver enzymes and consider liver function tests
* Monitor kidney function and consider renal ultrasound
* Monitor respiratory status and consider mechanical ventilation if necessary
* Monitor neurological status and consider imaging studies if necessary
* Continue pain management with fentanyl
* Continue bowel regimen with colace/senna
* Continue VAP bundle
* Consider PPI if necessary"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**2123-9-22**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2266**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic on ABG likely from contraction alkolosis
   [**12-21**] overdiuresis and overcompensated resp alkalosis for lactate.
   Elevated lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis
   concerning for sepsis. Source of infection include a mesenteric
   ischemia given his afib that had not been anticoagulated prior to
   admission or HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and AMS.
   Less likely to be PNA given lack of hypoxia on ABG. Cdiff neg x1 this
   admission and no diarrhea currently(which you would also expect with
   mesenteric ischemia). Has not spiked fever yet. Patient transfered to
   [**Hospital1 **] for lower ext pain but ulcers and quite superficial and do not
   appear to be source of infection. Also with leukocytosis and elevated
   dbili should consider cholangitis in differential. Another likely
   possibility is cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion and
   lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, and PVD who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital. The patient has been experiencing severe shock, and the note highlights several potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has elevated lactate levels, leukocytosis, and tachycardia, which are concerning for sepsis. The source of infection is unclear, but it could be related to mesenteric ischemia, HAP/aspiration, or cholangitis.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has a history of CAD and CHF, and his EF is only 10%. He is currently in cardiogenic shock, which may be exacerbated by sepsis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation. He has a history of COPD, but it is unclear how severe it is.
4. Neurological dysfunction: The patient has altered mental status, which may be related to sepsis, hypoxia, or medication. He also has myoclonic jerks, which could be toxic-metabolic in nature.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient has AKI, which may be related to pre-renal causes, ATN, or post-renal causes. He also has a history of elevated PSA, which could be related to BPH or post-obstructive nephropathy.
6. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient has transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia, which could be related to hepatic congestion, cholangitis, or myocyte necrosis.
7. Hematuria: The patient has hematuria, which may be related to trauma to the foley catheter or underlying kidney disease.
8. Anxiety: The patient has anxiety, which may be related to his son's diagnosis of cancer and his own poor appetite.

The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and the team is considering additional diagnostic tests, including a CTA chest and abdomen, TEE, and a renal ultrasound. The patient is also receiving supportive care, including vasopressors, inotropes, and mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

1. Septic shock
2. Cardiac arrest
3. Respiratory failure
4. Neurological deterioration
5. Renal failure
6. Hepatic failure
7. Hemorrhagic complications
8. Infection-related complications, such as pneumonia or sepsis

The patient's care plan should focus on addressing these potential complications and providing supportive care to stabilize his condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 10%
   with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, recently
   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**2123-9-22**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2266**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic on ABG likely from contraction alkolosis
   [**12-21**] overdiuresis and overcompensated resp alkalosis for lactate.
   Elevated lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis
   concerning for sepsis. Source of infection include a mesenteric
   ischemia given his afib that had not been anticoagulated prior to
   admission or HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and AMS.
   Less likely to be PNA given lack of hypoxia on ABG. Cdiff neg x1 this
   admission and no diarrhea currently(which you would also expect with
   mesenteric ischemia). Has not spiked fever yet. Patient transfered to
   [**Hospital1 **] for lower ext pain but ulcers and quite superficial and do not
   appear to be source of infection. Also with leukocytosis and elevated
   dbili should consider cholangitis in differential. Another likely
   possibility is cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion and
   lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.
   - on vancomycin for presumed sepsis
   - AG closing
   - Lactate decreased to 2.9
   - CXR from admission did not show evidence of infiltrates
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - f/u lipase, LFTS
   .
   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**9-23**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**12-21**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. We are moving towards considering
   this endstage CHF, we will approach palliative care shortly pending
   better family understanding.
   - hold diuresis, continue milrinone
   - would benefit from beta-blocker and ACEI once more medically stable
   - CVP is down, though complicated by poor flow
   - consider ICD in future if patient stabilizes
   - currently in cardiogenic shock, ?contribution of sepsis
   - pressor dependent (milrinone +/- phenylephrine)
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in Afib, likely [**12-21**] to dilated atria and
   MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 368**] old LBBB so hard to interpret for new ischemia but should rule
   it out.  TEE revealed intracardiac thrombus so cannot cardiovert at
   this time.
   - monitor on tele
   - heparin gtt
   - continue rate control
   - stopped amiodarone
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has history of CAD and CABG. No history of CP and
   LBBB makes it difficult to interpret ischemic pattern on EKG.
   - trend CEZ, some contribution of renal failure, cath not currently
   indicated, no ischemic changes on TTE
   - cont ASA, hold gemfibrozil and BB
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Had completed 7 day course of Levaquin for pneumonia at
   OSH, please see discussion above for concerns of possible infectious
   etiologies and plan.  Now downtrending.
   - SIRS + with bacteria in sputum
   - on vanc
   .
   # AMS: Patient's mental status and been normal and AAOx3 prior to this
   morning. Underlying infectious process combinted with lactic acidosis
   and respiratory alkalosis likely contributing. Also, did have a fall
   and hit head two days prior to transfer with normal head CT at the
   time. In setting of supratherapeutic INR, should obtain head CT to rule
   out any evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Also having myoclonic
   jerks which is likely to be toxic-metabolic in nature as lytes are
   within normal limits.
   - correct INR (see below)
   - f/u MRI head, EEG
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - intubated for airway protection
   - treat infection as above
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Anticoagulated for Afib. Patient received 7.5
   mg of coumadin while being bridged on heparin and INR became
   supratherapeutic to [**3-24**] on [**9-25**] and both medication were discontinued.
   Unclear etiology but patient may have Vit K consumption [**12-21**] underlying
   bowel ischemia. DIC less likely given normal platelets and
   fibrinogen.   Received 4u FFP, INR this AM 2.3 (improved but still
   elevated).
   - given [**12-23**] U FFP with get INR<2 prior to central line placement
   - give 10 IV VitK x1 for now
   - trend coags
   .
   # AOCKD: Patient baseline 1.6, now 3.2 in setting of diuresis so likely
   pre-renal. C/w urine lytes, FeNa << 1%.  Also possible is ATN is
   setting of hypoperfusion with low CO. Also has history of elevated PSA
   so BPH and postobstructive is possible but patient has foley in place
   but it has been intermittantly clotted.
   - D/C CBI
   - Had good UOP on lasix
   - follow now that he is on milrinone alone
   - follow urine outputs
   - give 1L fluid
   - send urine cx
   .
   # Transaminitis/hyperbilirubinemia: Has AST, LDH elevated which may be
   [**12-21**] hepatic congestion with low EF. With bili elevated also should
   consider cholangitis.
   - trend LFTS
   - f/u CT abd
   .
   # HTN: Has a history of hypertension but currently hypotensive with
   severe shock.
   - hold BB and monitor
   .
   # HL: Hold gemfibrozil given transaminitis and shock
   .
   # DM: HA1C 7.3 on admission, had episodes of hypoglycemia at OSH so
   holding lantus.
   - cont RISS
   - follow BS, if continuously elevated can resume lantus and low dose
   .
   # Polycythemia: Hct elevated since OSH. Likely [**12-21**] to chronic hypoxia
   and stimulated epo response.  Improved now, could be [**12-21**] fluid shifts.
   - monitor for now
   .
   # COPD: Unclear how severe, no PFTs in computer. Satting well on room
   air prior to transfer. Does not appear to be chornic CO2 retainer.
   - hold advair while intubated
   - ipratropium/albuterol nebs
   .
   # LE ulcers/edema: Edema likely [**12-21**] venous insufficiency given multiple
   venous grafts. Otherwise intravascularly dry so unlikely related to
   heart failure. Ulcer differential includes PAD and venous
   insufficiency. Does not appear to be a diabetic ulcer. Vascular
   following.
   - vascular to do peripheral graft survival study when more stable
   - cont wound care
   - cont pneumoboots
   .
   # Hematuria: Apparently started in setting of fall that caused trauma
   to foley.
   - d/ced CBI
   - consider Urology consult if not improving.
   .
   # Anxiety: Apparently started in setting of son's diagnosis of cancer.
   Had been with poor appetite. Patient to be intubated.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 10%
   with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, recently
   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**2123-9-22**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2266**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic on ABG likely from contraction alkolosis
   [**12-21**] overdiuresis and overcompensated resp alkalosis for lactate.
   Elevated lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis
   concerning for sepsis. Source of infection include a mesenteric
   ischemia given his afib that had not been anticoagulated prior to
   admission or HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and AMS.
   Less likely to be PNA given lack of hypoxia on ABG. Cdiff neg x1 this
   admission and no diarrhea currently(which you would also expect with
   mesenteric ischemia). Has not spiked fever yet. Patient transfered to
   [**Hospital1 **] for lower ext pain but ulcers and quite superficial and do not
   appear to be source of infection. Also with leukocytosis and elevated
   dbili should consider cholangitis in differential. Another likely
   possibility is cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion and
   lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.
   - on vancomycin for presumed sepsis
   - AG closing
   - Lactate decreased to 2.9
   - CXR from admission did not show evidence of infiltrates
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - f/u lipase, LFTS
   .
   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**9-23**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**12-21**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. We are moving towards considering
   this endstage CHF, we will approach palliative care shortly pending
   better family understanding.
   - hold diuresis, continue milrinone
   - would benefit from beta-blocker and ACEI once more medically stable
   - CVP is down, though complicated by poor flow
   - consider ICD in future if patient stabilizes
   - currently in cardiogenic shock, ?contribution of sepsis
   - pressor dependent (milrinone +/- phenylephrine)
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in Afib, likely [**12-21**] to dilated atria and
   MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 368**] old LBBB so hard to interpret for new ischemia but should rule
   it out.  TEE revealed intracardiac thrombus so cannot cardiovert at
   this time.
   - monitor on tele
   - heparin gtt
   - continue rate control
   - stopped amiodarone
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has history of CAD and CABG. No history of CP and
   LBBB makes it difficult to interpret ischemic pattern on EKG.
   - trend CEZ, some contribution of renal failure, cath not currently
   indicated, no ischemic changes on TTE
   - cont ASA, hold gemfibrozil and BB
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Had completed 7 day course of Levaquin for pneumonia at
   OSH, please see discussion above for concerns of possible infectious
   etiologies and plan.  Now downtrending.
   - SIRS + with bacteria in sputum
   - on vanc
   .
   # AMS: Patient's mental status and been normal and AAOx3 prior to this
   morning. Underlying infectious process combinted with lactic acidosis
   and respiratory alkalosis likely contributing. Also, did have a fall
   and hit head two days prior to transfer with normal head CT at the
   time. In setting of supratherapeutic INR, should obtain head CT to rule
   out any evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Also having myoclonic
   jerks which is likely to be toxic-metabolic in nature as lytes are
   within normal limits.
   - correct INR (see below)
   - f/u MRI head, EEG
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - intubated for airway protection
   - treat infection as above
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Anticoagulated for Afib. Patient received 7.5
   mg of coumadin while being bridged on heparin and INR became
   supratherapeutic to [**3-24**] on [**9-25**] and both medication were discontinued.
   Unclear etiology but patient may have Vit K consumption [**12-21**] underlying
   bowel ischemia. DIC less likely given normal platelets and
   fibrinogen.   Received 4u FFP, INR this AM 2.3 (improved but still
   elevated).
   - given [**12-23**] U FFP with get INR<2 prior to central line placement
   - give 10 IV VitK x1 for now
   - trend coags
   .
   # AOCKD: Patient baseline 1.6, now 3.2 in setting of diuresis so likely
   pre-renal. C/w urine lytes, FeNa << 1%.  Also possible is ATN is
   setting of hypoperfusion with low CO. Also has history of elevated PSA
   so BPH and postobstructive is possible but patient has foley in place
   but it has been intermittantly clotted.
   - D/C CBI
   - Had good UOP on lasix
   - follow now that he is on milrinone alone
   - follow urine outputs
   - give 1L fluid
   - send urine cx
   .
   # Transaminitis/hyperbilirubinemia: Has AST, LDH elevated which may be
   [**12-21**] hepatic congestion with low EF. With bili elevated also should
   consider cholangitis.
   - trend LFTS
   - f/u CT abd
   .
   # HTN: Has a history of hypertension but currently hypotensive with
   severe shock.
   - hold BB and monitor
   .
   # HL: Hold gemfibrozil given transaminitis and shock
   .
   # DM: HA1C 7.3 on admission, had episodes of hypoglycemia at OSH so
   holding lantus.
   - cont RISS
   - follow BS, if continuously elevated can resume lantus and low dose
   .
   # Polycythemia: Hct elevated since OSH. Likely [**12-21**] to chronic hypoxia
   and stimulated epo response.  Improved now, could be [**12-21**] fluid shifts.
   - monitor for now
   .
   # COPD: Unclear how severe, no PFTs in computer. Satting well on room
   air prior to transfer. Does not appear to be chornic CO2 retainer.
   - hold advair while intubated
   - ipratropium/albuterol nebs
   .
   # LE ulcers/edema: Edema likely [**12-21**] venous insufficiency given multiple
   venous grafts. Otherwise intravascularly dry so unlikely related to
   heart failure. Ulcer differential includes PAD and venous
   insufficiency. Does not appear to be a diabetic ulcer. Vascular
   following.
   - vascular to do peripheral graft survival study when more stable
   - cont wound care
   - cont pneumoboots

   # Hematuria: Apparently started in setting of fall that caused trauma
   to foley.
   - d/ced CBI
   - consider Urology consult if not improving.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 8949**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Unresponsive.
   TEE with left atrial and vent thrombus so not candidate for DCCV.
   Off Amio.
   EEG and MRI for neuro eval.
   Urine output better on Milrinone.  Cr 3.2
   Medical Decision Making
   Will reassess neuro status and discuss plans with family.
   Prognosis very poor.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

* The patient is a 81-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, Afib, and PVD who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital with symptoms of hypoxia, AMS, and leukocytosis.
* The patient has a left atrial appendage thrombus, severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, and moderate mitral regurgitation, which is likely contributing to his cardiogenic shock and diffuse hypoperfusion.
* The patient has a supratherapeutic INR, which may be related to underlying bowel ischemia or Vit K consumption.
* The patient has transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia, which may be related to hepatic congestion or cholangitis.
* The patient has a history of hypertension, but is currently hypotensive.
* The patient has a Foley catheter in place, which has been intermittently clotted.
* The patient has a history of polycythemia, which may be related to chronic hypoxia and stimulated epo response.
* The patient has a history of COPD, but does not appear to be a chronic CO2 retainer.
* The patient has LE ulcers and edema, which may be related to venous insufficiency or PAD.
* The patient has hematuria, which may be related to a fall that caused trauma to the Foley catheter.
* The patient has anxiety and depression, which may be related to his son's diagnosis of cancer and his own poor appetite.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis, which may be related to the patient's leukocytosis and bacteria in his sputum.
* Cardiogenic shock, which may worsen the patient's hypoperfusion and lactic acidosis.
* Hepatic congestion or cholangitis, which may worsen the patient's transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia.
* Bowel ischemia or necrosis, which may worsen the patient's abdominal pain and diarrhea.
* Pulmonary edema, which may worsen the patient's hypoxia and respiratory failure.
* Renal failure, which may worsen the patient's AKI and electrolyte imbalance.
* Neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, which may worsen the patient's AMS and cognitive impairment.
* Infection, which may worsen the patient's sepsis and increase his risk of death.

Based on the patient's condition and potential medical complications, I recommend the following:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including his blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
* Continue to administer IV fluids and vasopressors as needed to maintain the patient's blood pressure and perfusion.
* Continue to monitor the patient's urine output and electrolyte levels to prevent AKI and electrolyte imbalance.
* Continue to administer antibiotics to prevent sepsis and infection.
* Consider performing a CT scan of the patient's head to rule out intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
* Consider performing a MRI of the patient's brain to evaluate his neurologic status and potential complications.
* Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and cognitive function to assess his risk of neurological complications.
* Consider referring the patient to a palliative care team to discuss his end-of-life care options and provide emotional support to his family."

   81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 10%
   with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, recently
   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**2123-9-22**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2266**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic on ABG likely from contraction alkolosis
   [**12-21**] overdiuresis and overcompensated resp alkalosis for lactate.
   Elevated lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis
   concerning for sepsis. Source of infection include a mesenteric
   ischemia given his afib that had not been anticoagulated prior to
   admission or HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and AMS.
   Less likely to be PNA given lack of hypoxia on ABG. Cdiff neg x1 this
   admission and no diarrhea currently(which you would also expect with
   mesenteric ischemia). Has not spiked fever yet. Patient transfered to
   [**Hospital1 **] for lower ext pain but ulcers and quite superficial and do not
   appear to be source of infection. Also with leukocytosis and elevated
   dbili should consider cholangitis in differential. Another likely
   possibility is cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion and
   lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.
   - on vancomycin
   - CXR from admission did not show evidence of infiltrates
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - f/u lipase, LFTS
   .
   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**9-23**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**12-21**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. Cardiac
   - hold diuresis
   - would benefit from beta-blocker and ACEI once more medically stable
   - CVP looks even, though complicated by poor flow
   - consider ICD in future if patient stabilizes

   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in Afib, likely [**12-21**] to dilated atria and
   MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 368**] old LBBB so hard to interpret for new ischemia but should rule
   it out.  TEE revealed intracardiac thrombus so cannot cardiovert at
   this time.

   - heparin gtt
   - continue rate control
   - stopped amiodarone

   # CORONARIES: Patient has history of CAD and CABG. No history of CP and
   LBBB makes it difficult to interpret ischemic pattern on EKG.
   - trend CEZ, some contribution of renal failure, cath not currently
   indicated, no ischemic changes on TTE
   - cont ASA, hold gemfibrozil and BB

   # Leukocytosis: Had completed 7 day course of Levaquin for pneumonia at
   OSH, please see discussion above for concerns of possible infectious
   etiologies and plan.  Now downtrending.

   - on vanc
   .
   # AMS: Patient's mental status and been normal and AAOx3 prior to this
   morning. Underlying infectious process combinted with lactic acidosis
   and respiratory alkalosis likely contributing. Also, did have a fall
   and hit head two days prior to transfer with normal head CT at the
   time. In setting of supratherapeutic INR, should obtain head CT to rule
   out any evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Also having myoclonic
   jerks which is likely to be toxic-metabolic in nature as elytes are
   within normal limits.
   - correct INR (see below)
   - f/u MRI head, EEG
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - intubated for airway protection
   - treat infection as above

   # Supratherapeutic INR: Anticoagulated for Afib. Patient received 7.5
   mg of coumadin while being bridged on heparin and INR became
   supratherapeutic to [**3-24**] on [**9-25**] and both medication were discontinued.
   Unclear etiology but patient may have Vit K consumption [**12-21**] underlying
   bowel ischemia. DIC less likely given normal platelets and fibrinogen.
     Received 4u FFP, INR this AM 2.3 (improved but still elevated).
   - given [**12-23**] U FFP with get INR<2 prior to central line placement
   - give 10 IV VitK x1 for now

   # AOCKD: Patient baseline 1.6, now 3.2 in setting of diuresis so likely
   pre-renal. C/w urine lytes, FeNa << 1%.  Also possible is ATN is
   setting of hypoperfusion with low CO. Also has history of elevated PSA
   so BPH and postobstructive is possible but patient has foley in place

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, DM, and PVD who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital due to cardiac arrest. He has been diagnosed with a left atrial appendage thrombus, severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, and moderate mitral regurgitation. He is currently in cardiogenic shock and is being treated with milrinone and lasix for cardiac failure. He has also been diagnosed with sepsis, likely due to a mesenteric ischemia or HAP/aspiration, and is being treated with vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac function is severely impaired, and he is at risk for further deterioration.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic state is likely to worsen if not adequately treated, and may lead to organ failure.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and he is at risk for bleeding complications.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is at risk for further deterioration.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and is at risk for further respiratory compromise.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's mental status is altered, and he is at risk for further neurological deterioration.
7. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and he is at risk for further liver dysfunction.
8. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatic enzymes are elevated, and he is at risk for pancreatitis.
9. Cholangitis: The patient's bilirubin level is elevated, and he is at risk for cholangitis.
10. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient's septic state and abnormal liver function tests suggest the possibility of an intra-abdominal abscess."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 10%
   with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, recently
   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**2123-9-22**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2266**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic on ABG likely from contraction alkolosis
   [**12-21**] overdiuresis and overcompensated resp alkalosis for lactate.
   Elevated lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis
   concerning for sepsis. Source of infection include a mesenteric
   ischemia given his afib that had not been anticoagulated prior to
   admission or HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and AMS.
   Less likely to be PNA given lack of hypoxia on ABG. Cdiff neg x1 this
   admission and no diarrhea currently(which you would also expect with
   mesenteric ischemia). Has not spiked fever yet. Patient transfered to
   [**Hospital1 **] for lower ext pain but ulcers and quite superficial and do not
   appear to be source of infection. Also with leukocytosis and elevated
   dbili should consider cholangitis in differential. Another likely
   possibility is cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion and
   lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.
   - on vancomycin for presumed sepsis
   - AG closing
   - Lactate decreased to 2.9
   - CXR from admission did not show evidence of infiltrates
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - f/u lipase, LFTS
   .
   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**9-23**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**12-21**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. We are moving towards considering
   this endstage CHF, we will approach palliative care shortly pending
   better family understanding.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 10%
   with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, recently
   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**2123-9-22**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2266**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic on ABG likely from contraction alkolosis
   [**12-21**] overdiuresis and overcompensated resp alkalosis for lactate.
   Elevated lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis
   concerning for sepsis. Source of infection include a mesenteric
   ischemia given his afib that had not been anticoagulated prior to
   admission or HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and AMS.
   Less likely to be PNA given lack of hypoxia on ABG. Cdiff neg x1 this
   admission and no diarrhea currently(which you would also expect with
   mesenteric ischemia). Has not spiked fever yet. Patient transfered to
   [**Hospital1 **] for lower ext pain but ulcers and quite superficial and do not
   appear to be source of infection. Also with leukocytosis and elevated
   dbili should consider cholangitis in differential. Another likely
   possibility is cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion and
   lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.
   - on vancomycin for presumed sepsis
   - AG closing
   - Lactate decreased to 2.9
   - CXR from admission did not show evidence of infiltrates
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - f/u lipase, LFTS
   .
   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**9-23**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**12-21**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. We are moving towards considering
   this endstage CHF, we will approach palliative care shortly pending
   better family understanding.

   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in Afib, likely [**12-21**] to dilated atria and
   MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 368**] old LBBB so hard to interpret for new ischemia but should rule
   it out.  TEE revealed intracardiac thrombus so cannot cardiovert at

   - on vanc
   .
   # AMS: Patient's mental status and been normal and AAOx3 prior to this
   morning. Underlying infectious process combinted with lactic acidosis
   and respiratory alkalosis likely contributing. Also, did have a fall
   and hit head two days prior to transfer with normal head CT at the
   time. In setting of supratherapeutic INR, should obtain head CT to rule
   out any evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Also having myoclonic
   jerks which is likely to be toxic-metabolic in nature as elytes are
   within normal limits.
   - correct INR (see below)
   - f/u MRI head, EEG
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - intubated for airway protection
   - treat infection as above
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Anticoagulated for Afib. Patient received 7.5
   mg of coumadin while being bridged on heparin and INR became
   supratherapeutic to [**3-24**] on [**9-25**] and both medication were discontinued.
   Unclear etiology but patient may have Vit K consumption [**12-21**] underlying
   bowel ischemia. DIC less likely given normal platelets and
   fibrinogen.   Received 4u FFP, INR this AM 2.3 (improved but still
   elevated).
   - given [**12-23**] U FFP with get INR<2 prior to central line placement
   - give 10 IV VitK x1 for now

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, and recent diagnosis of Afib. He was admitted to the ICU with severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, moderate mitral regurgitation, and severe thoracic aortic atherosclerosis. He has been treated with various medications, including milrinone, lasix, and heparin. His condition has been complicated by sepsis, likely caused by a mesenteric ischemia, and he has developed a left atrial appendage thrombus.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac function is severely compromised, and he may be at risk of developing cardiogenic shock, which could lead to further deterioration in his condition.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely caused by a mesenteric ischemia, and if not properly treated, it could lead to organ failure and death.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, and he may be at risk of developing respiratory failure, which could require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is deteriorating, and he may be at risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or encephalopathy.
5. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and he may be at risk of developing acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
6. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function is compromised, and he may be at risk of developing acute liver failure or chronic liver disease.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, and he may be at risk of developing bleeding complications or thrombotic events.
8. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing secondary infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or septicemia.
9. Organ failure: The patient's multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is a concern, and he may be at risk of developing organ failure, which could lead to a poor outcome.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent further complications and improve his chances of survival."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 10%
   with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, recently
   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**2123-9-22**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2266**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic on ABG likely from contraction alkolosis
   [**12-21**] overdiuresis and overcompensated resp alkalosis for lactate.
   Elevated lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis
   concerning for sepsis. Source of infection include a mesenteric
   ischemia given his afib that had not been anticoagulated prior to
   admission or HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and AMS.
   Less likely to be PNA given lack of hypoxia on ABG. Cdiff neg x1 this
   admission and no diarrhea currently(which you would also expect with
   mesenteric ischemia). Has not spiked fever yet. Patient transfered to
   [**Hospital1 **] for lower ext pain but ulcers and quite superficial and do not
   appear to be source of infection. Also with leukocytosis and elevated
   dbili should consider cholangitis in differential. Another likely
   possibility is cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion and
   lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.
   - on vancomycin for presumed sepsis
   - AG closing
   - Lactate decreased to 2.9
   - CXR from admission did not show evidence of infiltrates
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - f/u lipase, LFTS
   .
   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**9-23**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**12-21**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. We are moving towards considering
   this endstage CHF, we will approach palliative care shortly pending
   better family understanding.
   - hold diuresis, continue milrinone
   - would benefit from beta-blocker and ACEI once more medically stable
   - CVP is down, though complicated by poor flow
   - consider ICD in future if patient stabilizes
   - currently in cardiogenic shock, ?contribution of sepsis
   - pressor dependent (milrinone +/- phenylephrine)
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in Afib, likely [**12-21**] to dilated atria and
   MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 368**] old LBBB so hard to interpret for new ischemia but should rule
   it out.  TEE revealed intracardiac thrombus so cannot cardiovert at
   this time.
   - monitor on tele
   - heparin gtt
   - continue rate control
   - stopped amiodarone
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has history of CAD and CABG. No history of CP and
   LBBB makes it difficult to interpret ischemic pattern on EKG.
   - trend CEZ, some contribution of renal failure, cath not currently
   indicated, no ischemic changes on TTE
   - cont ASA, hold gemfibrozil and BB
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Had completed 7 day course of Levaquin for pneumonia at
   OSH, please see discussion above for concerns of possible infectious
   etiologies and plan.  Now downtrending.
   - SIRS + with bacteria in sputum
   - on vanc
   .
   # AMS: Patient's mental status and been normal and AAOx3 prior to this
   morning. Underlying infectious process combinted with lactic acidosis
   and respiratory alkalosis likely contributing. Also, did have a fall
   and hit head two days prior to transfer with normal head CT at the
   time. In setting of supratherapeutic INR, should obtain head CT to rule
   out any evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Also having myoclonic
   jerks which is likely to be toxic-metabolic in nature as lytes are
   within normal limits.
   - correct INR (see below)
   - f/u MRI head, EEG
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - intubated for airway protection
   - treat infection as above
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Anticoagulated for Afib. Patient received 7.5
   mg of coumadin while being bridged on heparin and INR became
   supratherapeutic to [**3-24**] on [**9-25**] and both medication were discontinued.
   Unclear etiology but patient may have Vit K consumption [**12-21**] underlying
   bowel ischemia. DIC less likely given normal platelets and
   fibrinogen.   Received 4u FFP, INR this AM 2.3 (improved but still
   elevated).
   - given [**12-23**] U FFP with get INR<2 prior to central line placement
   - give 10 IV VitK x1 for now
   - trend coags
   .
   # AOCKD: Patient baseline 1.6, now 3.2 in setting of diuresis so likely
   pre-renal. C/w urine lytes, FeNa << 1%.  Also possible is ATN is
   setting of hypoperfusion with low CO. Also has history of elevated PSA
   so BPH and postobstructive is possible but patient has foley in place
   but it has been intermittantly clotted.
   - D/C CBI
   - Had good UOP on lasix
   - follow now that he is on milrinone alone
   - follow urine outputs
   - give 1L fluid
   - send urine cx
   .
   # Transaminitis/hyperbilirubinemia: Has AST, LDH elevated which may be
   [**12-21**] hepatic congestion with low EF. With bili elevated also should
   consider cholangitis.
   - trend LFTS
   - f/u CT abd
   .
   # HTN: Has a history of hypertension but currently hypotensive with
   severe shock.
   - hold BB and monitor
   .
   # HL: Hold gemfibrozil given transaminitis and shock
   .
   # DM: HA1C 7.3 on admission, had episodes of hypoglycemia at OSH so
   holding lantus.
   - cont RISS
   - follow BS, if continuously elevated can resume lantus and low dose
   .
   # Polycythemia: Hct elevated since OSH. Likely [**12-21**] to chronic hypoxia
   and stimulated epo response.  Improved now, could be [**12-21**] fluid shifts.
   - monitor for now
   .
   # COPD: Unclear how severe, no PFTs in computer. Satting well on room
   air prior to transfer. Does not appear to be chornic CO2 retainer.
   - hold advair while intubated
   - ipratropium/albuterol nebs
   .
   # LE ulcers/edema: Edema likely [**12-21**] venous insufficiency given multiple
   venous grafts. Otherwise intravascularly dry so unlikely related to
   heart failure. Ulcer differential includes PAD and venous
   insufficiency. Does not appear to be a diabetic ulcer. Vascular
   following.
   - vascular to do peripheral graft survival study when more stable
   - cont wound care
   - cont pneumoboots
   .
   # Hematuria: Apparently started in setting of fall that caused trauma
   to foley.
   - d/ced CBI
   - consider Urology consult if not improving.
   .
   # Anxiety: Apparently started in setting of son's diagnosis of cancer.
   Had been with poor appetite. Patient to be intubated.
   - readdress when more stable

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic on ABG likely from contraction alkolosis
   [**12-21**] overdiuresis and overcompensated resp alkalosis for lactate.
   Elevated lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis
   concerning for sepsis. Source of infection include a mesenteric
   ischemia given his afib that had not been anticoagulated prior to
   admission or HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and AMS.
   Less likely to be PNA given lack of hypoxia on ABG. Cdiff neg x1 this
   admission and no diarrhea currently(which you would also expect with
   mesenteric ischemia). Has not spiked fever yet. Patient transfered to
   [**Hospital1 **] for lower ext pain but ulcers and quite superficial and do not
   appear to be source of infection. Also with leukocytosis and elevated
   dbili should consider cholangitis in differential. Another likely
   possibility is cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion and
   lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   is no evidence of CHF.
   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 10%
   with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, recently
   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**2123-9-22**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2266**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic [**12-21**] to contraction alkolosis from
   overdiuresis and resp alkalosis compensation for lactate. Elevated
   lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis concerning for
   sepsis.  Likely HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and
   AMS.  Cdiff neg x1 this admission and no diarrhea currently.
   Leukocytosis and elevated dbili concerning for cholangitis.  Most
   likely he is in cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion
   and lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.
   - on vancomycin for presumed sepsis
   - AG closing
   - Lactate decreased to 2.3
   - CXR from admission did not show evidence of infiltrates
   .
   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**9-23**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**12-21**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. We are moving towards considering
   this endstage CHF, we will approach palliative care shortly pending
   better family understanding.
   - hold diuresis and milrinone
   - would benefit from beta-blocker and ACEI
   - CVP is down, though complicated by poor flow

   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in Afib, likely [**12-21**] to dilated atria and
   MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 368**] old LBBB so hard to interpret for new ischemia but should rule
   it out.  TEE revealed intracardiac thrombus so cannot cardiovert at
   this time.
   - monitor on tele
   - heparin gtt
   - continue rate control
   - stopped amiodarone

   # CORONARIES: Patient has history of CAD and CABG. No history of CP and
   LBBB makes it difficult to interpret ischemic pattern on EKG.
   - trend CEZ, some contribution of renal failure, cath not currently
   indicated, no ischemic changes on TTE
   - cont ASA, hold gemfibrozil and BB
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Had completed 7 day course of Levaquin for pneumonia at
   OSH, please see discussion above for concerns of possible infectious
   etiologies and plan.  Now downtrending.
   - SIRS + with bacteria in sputum
   - on vanc
   .
   # AMS: Patient's mental status and been normal and AAOx3 prior to this
   morning. Underlying infectious process combinted with lactic acidosis
   and respiratory alkalosis likely contributing. Also, did have a fall
   and hit head two days prior to transfer with normal head CT at the
   time. In setting of supratherapeutic INR, should obtain head CT to rule
   out any evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Also having myoclonic
   jerks which is likely to be toxic-metabolic in nature as lytes are
   within normal limits.
   - correct INR (see below)
   - f/u MRI head, EEG
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - intubated for airway protection
   - treat infection as above

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, heart failure with an ejection fraction of 10%, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic, and has since been diagnosed with sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and acute kidney injury.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.4°C (99.4°F)
* Heart rate: 117 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 101/42 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Central venous pressure: 9 mmHg

The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and has been treated with multiple medications, including milrinone, lasix, and metoprolol. He has also received antibiotics, including vancomycin, and has been treated with heparin and aspirin.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 14.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 14.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 138 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 3.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 17.3 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.3 mmol/L
* Troponin-T: 0.95 ng/mL
* Brain natriuretic peptide: 427 pg/mL

The patient has a high risk of developing complications, including:

* Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to infection.
* Cardiogenic shock: The patient has cardiogenic shock, which is a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient has acute kidney injury, which is a condition in which the kidneys are unable to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood.
* Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure, which is a condition in which the lungs are unable to provide enough oxygen to the body.
* Neurological complications: The patient has a history of stroke and has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, which is a risk factor for stroke.

The patient's medical team is considering the following potential medical complications:

* End-stage heart failure: The patient's heart failure is severe and may be end-stage, which would require palliative care and end-of-life planning.
* Sepsis-induced cardiogenic shock: The patient's sepsis may be contributing to his cardiogenic shock, which would require close monitoring and treatment.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may be worsening, which would require close monitoring and treatment.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be worsening, which would require close monitoring and treatment.
* Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status may be worsening, which would require close monitoring and treatment.

The patient's family is being educated on his condition and is being encouraged to establish realistic goals of care. The patient's medical team is also considering the need for palliative care and end-of-life planning."

   MRI of Head [**9-29**]:
   1. No MR evidence of acute infarction or hemorrhage. Mild
   microangiopathic ischemic white matter disease.
   2. Atherosclerotic irregularity involving the cavernous portions of
   both internal carotid arteries with severe stenosis of the cavernous
   left ICA.
   CXR: [**9-29**]
   Large atelectasis in the left lower lobe new from [**9-27**] is
   unchanged from [**9-28**]. Small left pleural effusion is
   stable. Minimal right upper lobe opacity consistent with atelectasis is
   unchanged. Lines and tubes remain in place in standard position. There
   is no evidence of CHF.
   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 10%
   with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, recently
   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**2123-9-22**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2266**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic [**12-21**] to contraction alkolosis from
   overdiuresis and resp alkalosis compensation for lactate. Elevated
   lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis concerning for
   sepsis.  Likely HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and
   AMS.  Cdiff neg x1 this admission and no diarrhea currently.
   Leukocytosis and elevated dbili concerning for cholangitis.  Most
   likely he is in cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion
   and lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.
   - on vancomycin for presumed sepsis
   - AG closing
   - Lactate decreased to 2.3
   - CXR from admission did not show evidence of infiltrates
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - trend LFTS
   .
   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**9-23**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**12-21**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. We are moving towards considering
   this endstage CHF, we will approach palliative care shortly pending
   better family understanding.
   - hold diuresis and milrinone
   - would benefit from beta-blocker and ACEI once more medically stable
   - CVP is down, though complicated by poor flow
   - consider ICD in future if patient stabilizes
   - currently in cardiogenic shock, ?contribution of sepsis
   - pressor dependent (milrinone +/- phenylephrine)
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in Afib, likely [**12-21**] to dilated atria and
   MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 368**] old LBBB so hard to interpret for new ischemia but should rule
   it out.  TEE revealed intracardiac thrombus so cannot cardiovert at
   this time.
   - monitor on tele
   - heparin gtt
   - continue rate control
   - stopped amiodarone
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has history of CAD and CABG. No history of CP and
   LBBB makes it difficult to interpret ischemic pattern on EKG.
   - trend CEZ, some contribution of renal failure, cath not currently
   indicated, no ischemic changes on TTE
   - cont ASA, hold gemfibrozil and BB
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Had completed 7 day course of Levaquin for pneumonia at
   OSH, please see discussion above for concerns of possible infectious
   etiologies and plan.  Now downtrending.
   - SIRS + with bacteria in sputum
   - on vanc
   .
   # AMS: Patient's mental status and been normal and AAOx3 prior to this
   morning. Underlying infectious process combinted with lactic acidosis
   and respiratory alkalosis likely contributing. Also, did have a fall
   and hit head two days prior to transfer with normal head CT at the
   time. In setting of supratherapeutic INR, should obtain head CT to rule
   out any evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Also having myoclonic
   jerks which is likely to be toxic-metabolic in nature as lytes are
   within normal limits.
   - correct INR (see below)
   - f/u MRI head, EEG
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - intubated for airway protection
   - treat infection as above
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Anticoagulated for Afib. Patient received 7.5
   mg of coumadin while being bridged on heparin and INR became
   supratherapeutic to [**3-24**] on [**9-25**] and both medication were discontinued.
   Unclear etiology but patient may have Vit K consumption [**12-21**] underlying
   bowel ischemia. DIC less likely given normal platelets and
   fibrinogen.   Received 4u FFP, INR this AM 2.3 (improved but still
   elevated).
   - given [**12-23**] U FFP with get INR<2 prior to central line placement
   - given 10 IV VitK x1 for now
   - trend coags
   .
   # AOCKD: Patient baseline 1.6, now 3.2 in setting of diuresis so likely
   pre-renal. C/w urine lytes, FeNa << 1%.  Also possible is ATN is
   setting of hypoperfusion with low CO. Also has history of elevated PSA
   so BPH and postobstructive is possible but patient has foley in place
   but it has been intermittantly clotted.
   - D/C CBI
   - Had good UOP on lasix
   - follow now that he is on milrinone alone
   - follow urine outputs
   - give 1L fluid
   - send urine cx
   .
   # Transaminitis/hyperbilirubinemia: Has AST, LDH elevated which may be
   [**12-21**] hepatic congestion with low EF. With bili elevated also should
   consider cholangitis.
   - trend LFTS
   - f/u CT abd
   .
   # HTN: Has a history of hypertension but currently hypotensive with
   severe shock.
   - hold BB and monitor
   .
   # HL: Hold gemfibrozil given transaminitis and shock
   .
   # DM: HA1C 7.3 on admission, had episodes of hypoglycemia at OSH so
   holding lantus.
   - cont RISS
   - follow BS, if continuously elevated can resume lantus and low dose
   .
   # Polycythemia: Hct elevated since OSH. Likely [**12-21**] to chronic hypoxia
   and stimulated epo response.  Improved now, could be [**12-21**] fluid shifts.
   - monitor for now
   .
   # COPD: Unclear how severe, no PFTs in computer. Satting well on room
   air prior to transfer. Does not appear to be chornic CO2 retainer.
   - hold advair while intubated
   - ipratropium/albuterol nebs
   .
   # LE ulcers/edema: Edema likely [**12-21**] venous insufficiency given multiple
   venous grafts. Otherwise intravascularly dry so unlikely related to
   heart failure. Ulcer differential includes PAD and venous
   insufficiency. Does not appear to be a diabetic ulcer. Vascular
   following.
   - vascular to do peripheral graft survival study when more stable
   - cont wound care
   - cont pneumoboots
   .
   # Hematuria: Apparently started in setting of fall that caused trauma
   to foley.
   - d/ced CBI
   - consider Urology consult if not improving.
   .
   # Anxiety: Apparently started in setting of son's diagnosis of cancer.
   Had been with poor appetite. Patient to be intubated.
   - readdress when more stable
   - hold amytriptilline

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - stopped milrinone, lasix as patient's CVP dropped to 7-9
   - Neuro: MRI and EEG suggest unlikely but not very poor chance of
   neurologic recovery
   - patient became tachycardic to 150s-160s, rate-controlled well with IV
   metoprolol 5 mg x 1
   - family meeting; very difficult to establish ""goals of care"" - son is
   insistent that patient be ""shocked once"" despite attempts to explain
   indications for CPR; very unclear that family, as a whole, understands
   medical situation.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, and PVD, who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital with right leg edema and weeping. He was found non-responsive and hypoxic, and was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and acidosis, and is receiving treatment for these conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Cardiac arrest due to cardiogenic shock
	* Arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, which can worsen cardiac function
	* Heart failure exacerbation
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections, which can worsen respiratory status
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
	* Respiratory failure
3. Neurological complications:
	* Seizures or status epilepticus due to electrolyte imbalances or metabolic acidosis
	* Neurological deterioration due to hypoxia or cardiac arrest
	* Infection-related encephalopathy
4. Renal complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to sepsis or cardiogenic shock
	* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) exacerbation
5. Hematological complications:
	* Thrombocytopenia due to sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
	* Coagulopathy due to liver disease or vitamin K deficiency
6. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer or gastrointestinal infection
	* Pancreatitis or cholangitis due to sepsis or biliary obstruction
7. Infection-related complications:
	* Sepsis or septic shock due to bacterial or fungal infections
	* Infection-related organ failure, such as respiratory or renal failure
8. Cardiovascular complications:
	* Cardiac tamponade due to pericarditis or cardiac rupture
	* Myocardial infarction or cardiac ischemia due to cardiogenic shock or sepsis
9. Metabolic complications:
	* Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia due to insulin resistance or insulin deficiency
	* Electrolyte imbalances due to fluid shifts or metabolic acidosis
10. Other complications:
	* Wound infection or compartment syndrome due to trauma or surgery
	* Pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis due to immobility or sepsis

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 10%
   with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, recently
   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**2123-9-22**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2266**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic [**12-21**] to contraction alkolosis from
   overdiuresis and resp alkalosis compensation for lactate. Elevated
   lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis concerning for
   sepsis.  Likely HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and
   AMS.  Cdiff neg x1 this admission and no diarrhea currently.
   Leukocytosis and elevated dbili concerning for cholangitis.  Most
   likely he is in cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion
   and lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.
   - on vancomycin for presumed sepsis
   - AG closing
   - Lactate decreased to 2.3
   - CXR from admission did not show evidence of infiltrates
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - trend LFTS

   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**9-23**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**12-21**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. We are moving towards considering
   this endstage CHF, we will approach palliative care shortly pending
   better family understanding.

   # AMS: Patient's mental status and been normal and AAOx3 prior to this
   morning. Underlying infectious process combinted with lactic acidosis
   and respiratory alkalosis likely contributing. Also, did have a fall
   and hit head two days prior to transfer with normal head CT at the
   time. In setting of supratherapeutic INR, should obtain head CT to rule
   out any evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Also having myoclonic
   jerks which is likely to be toxic-metabolic in nature as lytes are
   within normal limits.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, DM, and PVD who was transferred to the ICU from the CCU due to being found non-responsive and hypoxic. He has been diagnosed with sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and respiratory failure. His condition has been complicated by the development of atrial fibrillation, and he has required intubation and mechanical ventilation. His lab results show elevated lactate levels, leukocytosis, and transaminitis, which may be indicative of liver congestion or cholangitis. He also has a history of falls and has been diagnosed with a subdural hematoma.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and leukocytosis suggest that he may be at risk for sepsis. Close monitoring of his vital signs and lab results is necessary to detect any signs of sepsis.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock may be complicated by the development of atrial fibrillation, which can further reduce his cardiac output.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be complicated by the development of pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
4. Liver failure: The patient's transaminitis and elevated bilirubin levels may be indicative of liver failure or cholangitis.
5. Intracranial hemorrhage: The patient's history of falls and subdural hematoma make him at risk for intracranial hemorrhage.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's history of pneumonia and elevated white blood cell count make him at risk for developing pneumonia.
7. Cholangitis: The patient's elevated bilirubin levels and transaminitis may be indicative of cholangitis.
8. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's history of DM and elevated blood sugar levels make him at risk for developing diabetic ketoacidosis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and lab results closely to detect any signs of sepsis or cardiogenic shock.
2. Consider the use of antibiotics to treat any potential infections.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and consider the use of liver support therapy if necessary.
4. Consider the use of anticoagulation therapy to prevent the development of deep vein thrombosis.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider the use of respiratory support therapy if necessary.
6. Consider the use of insulin therapy to control the patient's blood sugar levels.
7. Monitor the patient's neurological status and consider the use of anticonvulsant therapy if necessary.
8. Consider the use of pain management therapy to control the patient's pain."

   MRI of Head [**9-29**]:
   1. No MR evidence of acute infarction or hemorrhage. Mild
   microangiopathic ischemic white matter disease.
   2. Atherosclerotic irregularity involving the cavernous portions of
   both internal carotid arteries with severe stenosis of the cavernous
   left ICA.
   CXR: [**9-29**]
   Large atelectasis in the left lower lobe new from [**9-27**] is
   unchanged from [**9-28**]. Small left pleural effusion is
   stable. Minimal right upper lobe opacity consistent with atelectasis is
   unchanged. Lines and tubes remain in place in standard position. There
   is no evidence of CHF.
   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 10%
   with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, recently
   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**2123-9-22**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2266**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic [**12-21**] to contraction alkolosis from
   overdiuresis and resp alkalosis compensation for lactate. Elevated
   lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis concerning for
   sepsis.  Likely HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and
   AMS.  Cdiff neg x1 this admission and no diarrhea currently.
   Leukocytosis and elevated dbili concerning for cholangitis.  Most
   likely he is in cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion
   and lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.
   - on vancomycin for presumed sepsis
   - AG closing
   - Lactate decreased to 2.3
   - CXR from admission did not show evidence of infiltrates
   .
   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**9-23**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**12-21**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. We are moving towards considering
   this endstage CHF, we will approach palliative care shortly pending
   better family understanding.
   - hold diuresis and milrinone
   - would benefit from beta-blocker and ACEI
   - CVP is down, though complicated by poor flow
   - consider ICD in future if patient stabilizes
   - currently in cardiogenic shock, ?contribution of sepsis
   - on levophed
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in Afib, likely [**12-21**] to dilated atria and
   MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 368**] old LBBB so hard to interpret for new ischemia but should rule
   it out.  TEE revealed intracardiac thrombus so cannot cardiovert at
   this time.
   - monitor on tele
   - heparin gtt
   - continue rate control
   - stopped amiodarone
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has history of CAD and CABG. No history of CP and
   LBBB makes it difficult to interpret ischemic pattern on EKG.
   - trend CEZ, some contribution of renal failure, cath not currently
   indicated, no ischemic changes on TTE
   - cont ASA, hold gemfibrozil and BB
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Had completed 7 day course of Levaquin for pneumonia at
   OSH, please see discussion above for concerns of possible infectious
   etiologies and plan.  Now downtrending.
   - SIRS + with bacteria in sputum
   - on vanc
   .
   # AMS: Patient's mental status and been normal and AAOx3 prior to this
   morning. Underlying infectious process combinted with lactic acidosis
   and respiratory alkalosis likely contributing. Also, did have a fall
   and hit head two days prior to transfer with normal head CT at the
   time. In setting of supratherapeutic INR, should obtain head CT to rule
   out any evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Also having myoclonic
   jerks which is likely to be toxic-metabolic in nature as lytes are
   within normal limits.
   - correct INR (see below)
   - f/u MRI head, EEG
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - intubated for airway protection
   - treat infection as above
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Anticoagulated for Afib. Patient received 7.5
   mg of coumadin while being bridged on heparin and INR became
   supratherapeutic to [**3-24**] on [**9-25**] and both medication were discontinued.
   Unclear etiology but patient may have Vit K consumption [**12-21**] underlying
   bowel ischemia. DIC less likely given normal platelets and
   fibrinogen.   Received 4u FFP, INR this AM 2.3 (improved but still
   elevated).
   - given [**12-23**] U FFP with get INR<2 prior to central line placement
   - given 10 IV VitK x1 for now
   - trend coags
   .
   # AOCKD: Patient baseline 1.6, now 3.2 in setting of diuresis so likely
   pre-renal. C/w urine lytes, FeNa << 1%.  Also possible is ATN is
   setting of hypoperfusion with low CO. Also has history of elevated PSA
   so BPH and postobstructive is possible but patient has foley in place
   but it has been intermittantly clotted.  Progressively worsening, Cr
   now > 4.
   - follow urine outputs
   .
   # Transaminitis/hyperbilirubinemia: Has AST, LDH elevated which may be
   [**12-21**] hepatic congestion with low EF. With bili elevated also should
   consider cholangitis. CT abd is benign.
   - trend LFTS
   .
   # HTN: Has a history of hypertension but currently hypotensive with
   severe shock.
   - hold BB and monitor
   .
   # HL: Hold gemfibrozil given transaminitis and shock
   .
   # DM: HA1C 7.3 on admission, had episodes of hypoglycemia at OSH so
   holding lantus.
   - cont RISS
   .
   # Polycythemia: Hct elevated since OSH. Likely [**12-21**] to chronic hypoxia
   and stimulated epo response.  Improved now, could be [**12-21**] fluid shifts.
   - monitor for now
   .
   # COPD: Unclear how severe, no PFTs in computer. Satting well on room
   air prior to transfer. Does not appear to be chornic CO2 retainer.
   - hold advair while intubated
   - ipratropium/albuterol nebs
   .
   # LE ulcers/edema: Edema likely [**12-21**] venous insufficiency given multiple
   venous grafts. Otherwise intravascularly dry so unlikely related to
   heart failure. Ulcer differential includes PAD and venous
   insufficiency. Does not appear to be a diabetic ulcer. Vascular
   following.
   - vascular to do peripheral graft survival study when more stable
   - cont wound care
   - cont pneumoboots
   .
   # Hematuria: Apparently started in setting of fall that caused trauma
   to foley.  CBI was d/ced, currently resolved.
   .
   # Anxiety: Apparently started in setting of son's diagnosis of cancer.
   Had been with poor appetite. Patient to be intubated.
   - readdress when more stable

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - stopped milrinone, lasix as patient's CVP dropped to 7-9
   - Neuro: MRI and EEG suggest unlikely but not very poor chance of
   neurologic recovery
   - patient became tachycardic to 150s-160s, rate-controlled well with IV
   metoprolol 5 mg x 1
   - family meeting; very difficult to establish ""goals of care"" - son is
   insistent that patient be ""shocked once"" despite attempts to explain
   indications for CPR; very unclear that family, as a whole, understands
   medical situation.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, DM, and PVD who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital due to right leg edema and weeping. He was found non-responsive and hypoxic, and was intubated for airway protection. The patient has a complex medical history, including recent hospitalizations, and is currently in cardiogenic shock with diffuse hypoperfusion and lactate acidosis. He has a history of Afib, and his EF is 10%. He is also experiencing leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and AMS, which are concerning for sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock is likely due to his underlying cardiomyopathy and recent deterioration in EF. His CVP is down, and he is on vasopressors, which may indicate poor cardiac output.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and AMS are concerning for sepsis. He has a history of recent hospitalizations and may have developed an infection.
3. Cholangitis: The patient's elevated bilirubin and transaminitis may indicate cholangitis, which is a potential complication of his underlying liver disease.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine and decreased urine output may indicate acute kidney injury, which is a common complication of cardiogenic shock.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to his underlying cardiomyopathy and recent deterioration in EF. His oxygen saturation is 99%, and he is on a ventilator, which may indicate poor respiratory function.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's AMS and myoclonic jerks may indicate neurological complications, such as seizures or encephalopathy, which are common complications of cardiogenic shock.
7. Bleeding complications: The patient's supratherapeutic INR and recent use of anticoagulation medications may indicate a risk of bleeding complications.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's cardiogenic shock and sepsis require immediate attention. His CVP is down, and he is on vasopressors, which may indicate poor cardiac output. His leukocytosis and elevated lactate require further evaluation and treatment. His cholangitis and transaminitis require further evaluation and treatment. His acute kidney injury requires further evaluation and treatment. His respiratory failure requires further evaluation and treatment. His neurological complications require further evaluation and treatment. His bleeding complications require further evaluation and treatment.

The patient's family meeting is scheduled to establish realistic goals of care. The patient's code status is full code. His disposition is CCU for now."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 10%
   with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, recently
   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**2123-9-22**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2266**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic [**12-21**] to contraction alkolosis from
   overdiuresis and resp alkalosis compensation for lactate. Elevated
   lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis concerning for
   sepsis.  Likely HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and
   AMS.  Cdiff neg x1 this admission and no diarrhea currently.
   Leukocytosis and elevated dbili concerning for cholangitis.  Most
   likely he is in cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion
   and lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.
   - on vancomycin for presumed sepsis
   - AG closing
   - Lactate decreased to 2.3
   - CXR from admission did not show evidence of infiltrates
   .
   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**9-23**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**12-21**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. We are moving towards considering
   this endstage CHF, we will approach palliative care shortly pending
   better family understanding.
   - hold diuresis and milrinone
   - would benefit from beta-blocker and ACEI
   - CVP is down, though complicated by poor flow
   - consider ICD in future if patient stabilizes
   - currently in cardiogenic shock, ?contribution of sepsis
   - on levophed
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in Afib, likely [**12-21**] to dilated atria and
   MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 368**] old LBBB so hard to interpret for new ischemia but should rule
   it out.  TEE revealed intracardiac thrombus so cannot cardiovert at
   this time.
   - monitor on tele
   - heparin gtt
   - continue rate control
   - stopped amiodarone
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has history of CAD and CABG. No history of CP and
   LBBB makes it difficult to interpret ischemic pattern on EKG.
   - trend CEZ, some contribution of renal failure, cath not currently
   indicated, no ischemic changes on TTE
   - cont ASA, hold gemfibrozil and BB
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Had completed 7 day course of Levaquin for pneumonia at
   OSH, please see discussion above for concerns of possible infectious
   etiologies and plan.  Now downtrending.
   - SIRS + with bacteria in sputum
   - on vanc
   .
   # AMS: Patient's mental status and been normal and AAOx3 prior to this
   morning. Underlying infectious process combinted with lactic acidosis
   and respiratory alkalosis likely contributing. Also, did have a fall
   and hit head two days prior to transfer with normal head CT at the
   time. In setting of supratherapeutic INR, should obtain head CT to rule
   out any evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Also having myoclonic
   jerks which is likely to be toxic-metabolic in nature as lytes are
   within normal limits.
   - correct INR (see below)
   - f/u MRI head, EEG
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - intubated for airway protection
   - treat infection as above
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Anticoagulated for Afib. Patient received 7.5
   mg of coumadin while being bridged on heparin and INR became
   supratherapeutic to [**3-24**] on [**9-25**] and both medication were discontinued.
   Unclear etiology but patient may have Vit K consumption [**12-21**] underlying
   bowel ischemia. DIC less likely given normal platelets and
   fibrinogen.   Received 4u FFP, INR this AM 2.3 (improved but still
   elevated).
   - given [**12-23**] U FFP with get INR<2 prior to central line placement
   - given 10 IV VitK x1 for now
   - trend coags
   .
   # AOCKD: Patient baseline 1.6, now 3.2 in setting of diuresis so likely
   pre-renal. C/w urine lytes, FeNa << 1%.  Also possible is ATN is
   setting of hypoperfusion with low CO. Also has history of elevated PSA
   so BPH and postobstructive is possible but patient has foley in place
   but it has been intermittantly clotted.  Progressively worsening, Cr
   now > 4.
   - follow urine outputs
   .
   # Transaminitis/hyperbilirubinemia: Has AST, LDH elevated which may be
   [**12-21**] hepatic congestion with low EF. With bili elevated also should
   consider cholangitis. CT abd is benign.
   - trend LFTS
   .
   # HTN: Has a history of hypertension but currently hypotensive with
   severe shock.
   - hold BB and monitor
   .
   # HL: Hold gemfibrozil given transaminitis and shock

   # DM: HA1C 7.3 on admission, had episodes of hypoglycemia at OSH so
   holding lantus.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, DM, and PVD, who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital with right leg edema and weeping. He was found non-responsive and hypoxic, and was intubated for airway protection. The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple organ dysfunction, including cardiogenic shock, sepsis, and liver dysfunction. He has a supratherapeutic INR, and is receiving heparin and vitamin K therapy.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock is likely due to his underlying heart condition, and may be exacerbated by his sepsis and liver dysfunction.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely caused by his underlying infections, including pneumonia and cholangitis.
3. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver dysfunction is likely caused by his sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and underlying liver disease.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure is likely caused by his cardiogenic shock, sepsis, and underlying kidney disease.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is likely caused by his underlying diabetes and stress response.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely caused by his cardiogenic shock, sepsis, and underlying heart condition.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely caused by his underlying lung disease and sepsis.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological complications, including myoclonic jerks and altered mental status, are likely caused by his underlying infections, sepsis, and liver dysfunction.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's condition is complex and multifaceted, and will require a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses his cardiogenic shock, sepsis, liver dysfunction, renal failure, hyperglycemia, hypotension, respiratory failure, and neurological complications. The patient will require close monitoring and management of his vital signs, fluid status, and laboratory values. He will also require treatment for his underlying infections, including antibiotics and antifungals, and will require ongoing management of his pain, anxiety, and other symptoms."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 10%
   with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, recently
   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**2123-9-22**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2266**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic [**12-21**] to contraction alkolosis from
   overdiuresis and resp alkalosis compensation for lactate. Elevated
   lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis concerning for
   sepsis.  Likely HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and
   AMS.  Cdiff neg x1 this admission and no diarrhea currently.
   Leukocytosis and elevated dbili concerning for cholangitis.  Most
   likely he is in cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion
   and lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.
   - on vancomycin for presumed sepsis
   - AG closing
   - Lactate decreased to 2.3
   - CXR from admission did not show evidence of infiltrates
   .
   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**9-23**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**12-21**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. We are moving towards considering
   this endstage CHF, we will approach palliative care shortly pending
   better family understanding.
   - hold diuresis and milrinone
   - would benefit from beta-blocker and ACEI
   - CVP is down, though complicated by poor flow
   - consider ICD in future if patient stabilizes
   - currently in cardiogenic shock, ?contribution of sepsis
   - on levophed
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in Afib, likely [**12-21**] to dilated atria and
   MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 368**] old LBBB so hard to interpret for new ischemia but should rule
   it out.  TEE revealed intracardiac thrombus so cannot cardiovert at
   this time.
   - monitor on tele
   - heparin gtt
   - continue rate control
   - stopped amiodarone
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has history of CAD and CABG. No history of CP and
   LBBB makes it difficult to interpret ischemic pattern on EKG.
   - trend CEZ, some contribution of renal failure, cath not currently
   indicated, no ischemic changes on TTE
   - cont ASA, hold gemfibrozil and BB
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Had completed 7 day course of Levaquin for pneumonia at
   OSH, please see discussion above for concerns of possible infectious
   etiologies and plan.  Now downtrending.
   - SIRS + with bacteria in sputum
   - on vanc
   .
   # AMS: Patient's mental status and been normal and AAOx3 prior to this
   morning. Underlying infectious process combinted with lactic acidosis
   and respiratory alkalosis likely contributing. Also, did have a fall
   and hit head two days prior to transfer with normal head CT at the
   time. In setting of supratherapeutic INR, should obtain head CT to rule
   out any evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Also having myoclonic
   jerks which is likely to be toxic-metabolic in nature as lytes are
   within normal limits.
   - correct INR (see below)
   - f/u MRI head, EEG
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - intubated for airway protection
   - treat infection as above
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Anticoagulated for Afib. Patient received 7.5
   mg of coumadin while being bridged on heparin and INR became
   supratherapeutic to [**3-24**] on [**9-25**] and both medication were discontinued.
   Unclear etiology but patient may have Vit K consumption [**12-21**] underlying
   bowel ischemia. DIC less likely given normal platelets and
   fibrinogen.   Received 4u FFP, INR this AM 2.3 (improved but still
   elevated).
   - given [**12-23**] U FFP with get INR<2 prior to central line placement
   - given 10 IV VitK x1 for now
   - trend coags
   .
   # AOCKD: Patient baseline 1.6, now 3.2 in setting of diuresis so likely
   pre-renal. C/w urine lytes, FeNa << 1%.  Also possible is ATN is
   setting of hypoperfusion with low CO. Also has history of elevated PSA
   so BPH and postobstructive is possible but patient has foley in place
   but it has been intermittantly clotted.  Progressively worsening, Cr
   now > 4.
   - follow urine outputs
   .
   # Transaminitis/hyperbilirubinemia: Has AST, LDH elevated which may be
   [**12-21**] hepatic congestion with low EF. With bili elevated also should
   consider cholangitis. CT abd is benign.
   - trend LFTS
   .
   # HTN: Has a history of hypertension but currently hypotensive with
   severe shock.
   - hold BB and monitor
   .
   # HL: Hold gemfibrozil given transaminitis and shock
   .
   # DM: HA1C 7.3 on admission, had episodes of hypoglycemia at OSH so
   holding lantus.
   - cont RISS
   .
   # Polycythemia: Hct elevated since OSH. Likely [**12-21**] to chronic hypoxia
   and stimulated epo response.  Improved now, could be [**12-21**] fluid shifts.
   - monitor for now
   .
   # COPD: Unclear how severe, no PFTs in computer. Satting well on room
   air prior to transfer. Does not appear to be chornic CO2 retainer.
   - hold advair while intubated
   - ipratropium/albuterol nebs
   .
   # LE ulcers/edema: Edema likely [**12-21**] venous insufficiency given multiple
   venous grafts. Otherwise intravascularly dry so unlikely related to
   heart failure. Ulcer differential includes PAD and venous
   insufficiency. Does not appear to be a diabetic ulcer. Vascular

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 10%
   with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, recently
   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**2123-9-22**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2266**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic [**12-21**] to contraction alkolosis from
   overdiuresis and resp alkalosis compensation for lactate. Elevated
   lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis concerning for
   sepsis.  Likely HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and
   AMS.  Cdiff neg x1 this admission and no diarrhea currently.
   Leukocytosis and elevated dbili concerning for cholangitis.  Most
   likely he is in cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion
   and lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.
   - on vancomycin for presumed sepsis
   - AG closing
   - Lactate decreased to 2.3
   - CXR from admission did not show evidence of infiltrates
   .
   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**9-23**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**12-21**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. We are moving towards considering
   this endstage CHF, we will approach palliative care shortly pending
   better family understanding.
   - hold diuresis and milrinone
   - would benefit from beta-blocker and ACEI
   - CVP is down, though complicated by poor flow
   - consider ICD in future if patient stabilizes
   - currently in cardiogenic shock, ?contribution of sepsis
   - on levophed
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in Afib, likely [**12-21**] to dilated atria and
   MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 368**] old LBBB so hard to interpret for new ischemia but should rule
   it out.  TEE revealed intracardiac thrombus so cannot cardiovert at
   this time.
   - monitor on tele
   - heparin gtt
   - continue rate control
   - stopped amiodarone
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has history of CAD and CABG. No history of CP and
   LBBB makes it difficult to interpret ischemic pattern on EKG.
   - trend CEZ, some contribution of renal failure, cath not currently
   indicated, no ischemic changes on TTE
   - cont ASA, hold gemfibrozil and BB
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Had completed 7 day course of Levaquin for pneumonia at
   OSH, please see discussion above for concerns of possible infectious
   etiologies and plan.  Now downtrending.
   - SIRS + with bacteria in sputum
   - on vanc
   .
   # AMS: Patient's mental status and been normal and AAOx3 prior to this
   morning. Underlying infectious process combinted with lactic acidosis
   and respiratory alkalosis likely contributing. Also, did have a fall
   and hit head two days prior to transfer with normal head CT at the
   time. In setting of supratherapeutic INR, should obtain head CT to rule
   out any evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Also having myoclonic
   jerks which is likely to be toxic-metabolic in nature as lytes are
   within normal limits.
   - correct INR (see below)
   - f/u MRI head, EEG
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - intubated for airway protection
   - treat infection as above
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Anticoagulated for Afib. Patient received 7.5
   mg of coumadin while being bridged on heparin and INR became
   supratherapeutic to [**3-24**] on [**9-25**] and both medication were discontinued.
   Unclear etiology but patient may have Vit K consumption [**12-21**] underlying
   bowel ischemia. DIC less likely given normal platelets and
   fibrinogen.   Received 4u FFP, INR this AM 2.3 (improved but still
   elevated).
   - given [**12-23**] U FFP with get INR<2 prior to central line placement
   - given 10 IV VitK x1 for now
   - trend coags
   .
   # AOCKD: Patient baseline 1.6, now 3.2 in setting of diuresis so likely
   pre-renal. C/w urine lytes, FeNa << 1%.  Also possible is ATN is
   setting of hypoperfusion with low CO. Also has history of elevated PSA
   so BPH and postobstructive is possible but patient has foley in place
   but it has been intermittantly clotted.  Progressively worsening, Cr
   now > 4.
   - follow urine outputs
   .
   # Transaminitis/hyperbilirubinemia: Has AST, LDH elevated which may be
   [**12-21**] hepatic congestion with low EF. With bili elevated also should
   consider cholangitis. CT abd is benign.
   - trend LFTS
   .
   # HTN: Has a history of hypertension but currently hypotensive with
   severe shock.
   - hold BB and monitor
   .
   # HL: Hold gemfibrozil given transaminitis and shock
   .
   # DM: HA1C 7.3 on admission, had episodes of hypoglycemia at OSH so
   holding lantus.
   - cont RISS
   .
   # Polycythemia: Hct elevated since OSH. Likely [**12-21**] to chronic hypoxia
   and stimulated epo response.  Improved now, could be [**12-21**] fluid shifts.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old male with history of CAD s/p CABG [**2110**], CHF with EF 10%
   with h/o flash pulm edema and respiratory arrest, DM, recently
   diagnosed Afib, and PVD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] with
   right leg edema and weeping on [**2123-9-22**] now presents as transfer from
   [**Hospital1 2266**] to the CCU after being found non-responsive and hypoxic.
   .
   # AG Met acidosis: Patient has had an AG that since [**9-25**] with lactate
   of 8. Patient was alkalotic [**12-21**] to contraction alkolosis from
   overdiuresis and resp alkalosis compensation for lactate. Elevated
   lactate, elevated RR, tachycardia, AMS, and leukocytosis concerning for
   sepsis.  Likely HAP/aspiration given his recent hospitalizations and
   AMS.  Cdiff neg x1 this admission and no diarrhea currently.
   Leukocytosis and elevated dbili concerning for cholangitis.  Most
   likely he is in cardiogenic shock resulting in diffuse hypoperfusion
   and lactatic acidosis even without underlying infectious etiology.  CTA
   chest and abd showed no sources of infection/mesenteric ischemia.
   - on vancomycin for presumed sepsis
   - AG closing
   - Lactate decreased to 2.3
   - CXR from admission did not show evidence of infiltrates
   .
   # PUMP: EF 10% on echo [**9-23**], thought to be ischemic in nature. Has
   recent deterioration in EF as 20% on OSH (down from 40%) which may be
   [**12-21**] relatively new Afib preventing exta cardiac output from atrial
   kick. Had been treated for with lasix gtt prior to transfer for CHF
   exacerbation. Currently, patient does have lower extremity edema but
   JVP not elevated and CXR without evidence of gross volume overload so
   likely eu to hypovolemic currently. We are moving towards considering
   this endstage CHF, we will approach palliative care shortly pending
   better family understanding.
   - hold diuresis and milrinone
   - would benefit from beta-blocker and ACEI
   - CVP is down, though complicated by poor flow
   - consider ICD in future if patient stabilizes
   - currently in cardiogenic shock, ?contribution of sepsis
   - on levophed
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient currently in Afib, likely [**12-21**] to dilated atria and
   MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 368**] old LBBB so hard to interpret for new ischemia but should rule
   it out.  TEE revealed intracardiac thrombus so cannot cardiovert at
   this time.
   - monitor on tele
   - heparin gtt
   - continue rate control
   - stopped amiodarone
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has history of CAD and CABG. No history of CP and
   LBBB makes it difficult to interpret ischemic pattern on EKG.
   - trend CEZ, some contribution of renal failure, cath not currently
   indicated, no ischemic changes on TTE
   - cont ASA, hold gemfibrozil and BB
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Had completed 7 day course of Levaquin for pneumonia at
   OSH, please see discussion above for concerns of possible infectious
   etiologies and plan.  Now downtrending.
   - SIRS + with bacteria in sputum
   - on vanc
   .
   # AMS: Patient's mental status and been normal and AAOx3 prior to this
   morning. Underlying infectious process combinted with lactic acidosis
   and respiratory alkalosis likely contributing. Also, did have a fall
   and hit head two days prior to transfer with normal head CT at the
   time. In setting of supratherapeutic INR, should obtain head CT to rule
   out any evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Also having myoclonic
   jerks which is likely to be toxic-metabolic in nature as lytes are
   within normal limits.
   - correct INR (see below)
   - f/u MRI head, EEG
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - intubated for airway protection
   - treat infection as above
   .
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Anticoagulated for Afib. Patient received 7.5
   mg of coumadin while being bridged on heparin and INR became
   supratherapeutic to [**3-24**] on [**9-25**] and both medication were discontinued.
   Unclear etiology but patient may have Vit K consumption [**12-21**] underlying
   bowel ischemia. DIC less likely given normal platelets and
   fibrinogen.   Received 4u FFP, INR this AM 2.3 (improved but still
   elevated).
   - given [**12-23**] U FFP with get INR<2 prior to central line placement
   - given 10 IV VitK x1 for now
   - trend coags
   .
   # AOCKD: Patient baseline 1.6, now 3.2 in setting of diuresis so likely
   pre-renal. C/w urine lytes, FeNa << 1%.  Also possible is ATN is
   setting of hypoperfusion with low CO. Also has history of elevated PSA
   so BPH and postobstructive is possible but patient has foley in place
   but it has been intermittantly clotted.  Progressively worsening, Cr
   now > 4.
   - follow urine outputs
   .
   # Transaminitis/hyperbilirubinemia: Has AST, LDH elevated which may be
   [**12-21**] hepatic congestion with low EF. With bili elevated also should
   consider cholangitis. CT abd is benign.
   - trend LFTS
   .
   # HTN: Has a history of hypertension but currently hypotensive with
   severe shock.
   - hold BB and monitor
   .
   # HL: Hold gemfibrozil given transaminitis and shock
   .
   # DM: HA1C 7.3 on admission, had episodes of hypoglycemia at OSH so
   holding lantus.
   - cont RISS
   .
   # Polycythemia: Hct elevated since OSH. Likely [**12-21**] to chronic hypoxia
   and stimulated epo response.  Improved now, could be [**12-21**] fluid shifts.
   - monitor for now
   .
   # COPD: Unclear how severe, no PFTs in computer. Satting well on room
   air prior to transfer. Does not appear to be chornic CO2 retainer.
   - hold advair while intubated
   - ipratropium/albuterol nebs
   .
   # LE ulcers/edema: Edema likely [**12-21**] venous insufficiency given multiple
   venous grafts. Otherwise intravascularly dry so unlikely related to
   heart failure. Ulcer differential includes PAD and venous
   insufficiency. Does not appear to be a diabetic ulcer. Vascular
   following.
   - vascular to do peripheral graft survival study when more stable
   - cont wound care
   - cont pneumoboots

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, DM, and PVD, who was transferred to the ICU from the CCU with a diagnosis of cardiogenic shock, sepsis, and acute kidney injury. He has a history of flash pulmonary edema and respiratory arrest, and was found non-responsive and hypoxic on admission. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with worsening acidosis, elevated lactate levels, and decreased cardiac output.

The patient has been treated with vancomycin for presumed sepsis, and has undergone various interventions to manage his cardiogenic shock, including the use of levophed and milrinone. He has also been treated for acute kidney injury with furosemide and hemodialysis.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, including elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, and C-reactive protein. His cardiac enzymes are elevated, and he has a history of myocardial infarction.

The patient's physical examination is significant for tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. His chest radiograph shows no evidence of infiltrates or effusions.

The patient's condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment to manage his cardiogenic shock and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and white blood cell count suggest sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock can lead to further deterioration in his cardiac function, and may require the use of advanced cardiovascular therapies such as mechanical circulatory support.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute kidney injury can lead to further deterioration in his cardiac function, and may require the use of renal replacement therapy.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure can lead to further deterioration in his cardiogenic shock, and may require the use of mechanical ventilation.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status is uncertain, and he may be at risk for further neurological deterioration.
6. Infection: The patient's sepsis can lead to further infection, which can worsen his cardiogenic shock and acute kidney injury.
7. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy can lead to bleeding complications, which can worsen his cardiogenic shock and acute kidney injury.
8. Metabolic Complications: The patient's metabolic derangements can lead to further complications, such as hyperglycemia and hyperkalemia."
