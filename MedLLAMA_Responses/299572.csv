   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo male with history of CML now presenting with altered mental
   status and hyperkalemia following clinic visit where patient noted to
   be substnatially somnolent requiring admission.  In the setting of
   sedation for CT scan patient with worsening mental status and to [**Hospital Ward Name **]
   ICU for further care with prominent findings of fever, leukocytosis and
   pulmonary infiltrate.
   1)Altered Mental Status--Likely related to pneumonia as primary insult
   in addition to multiple primary metabolic derangements defined below.
   On balance patient has shown substantial improvement overnight.
   -OOB to chair
   -Rx as below
   -Hold benzodiazepines
   2)Hypekalemia-
   -Improved through to this morning with Kayexalate
   -Will continue with monitoring and minimize any K+ intake
   -repeat Kayexalate to achieve K+ <5.5
   3)Pneumonia-
   -Azithromycin/CTX
   -Follow up sputum cultures, urine legionella and viral cultures
   -Tachypnea persistent and likely related to both
   infection/anxiety/fever contributing to mild metabolic alkalosis as
   well as the metabolic acidosis
   4)Acidemia-Is non-gap at admission and has been demonstrated to be
   likely renal source
   -Will support renal failure
   -Would consider HCO3- for any further worsening combined with worsening
   tachypnea
   5)Acute Renal Failure-Patient with findings to suggest that intrinsic
   renal insult is present--with FENa increased and suggestion of renal
   source of non-anion gap acidosis.  Will need further definition of
   source
   -Renal ultrasound
   -Urine sediment for possible RBC/WBC casts

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) who presented with altered mental status, hyperkalemia, and pneumonia following a clinic visit. The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for further care.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.6°F, heart rate of 80-90 bpm, blood pressure of 134/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30-39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%. The patient's physical examination revealed a thin general appearance, normal head, ears, nose, and throat, and symmetric chest expansion with crackles and wheezes.

Laboratory results show:

* Serum potassium (K+) level: 5.7 mEq/L
* White blood cell count (WBC): 9.4-10.8 K/uL
* Hematocrit (Hct): 26.2-25.1%
* Platelet count (Plt): 153-131 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 2.5-2.4 mg/dL
* Total CO2 (TCO2): 14 mmol/L
* Glucose: 139-100 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Altered mental status: likely related to pneumonia and multiple metabolic derangements. The patient has shown substantial improvement overnight.
2. Hyperkalemia: improved through Kayexalate administration, and the patient will continue to receive monitoring and minimize K+ intake. Repeat Kayexalate will be administered to achieve K+ <5.5.
3. Pneumonia: treated with azithromycin and ceftriaxone, with follow-up sputum cultures, urine legionella, and viral cultures.
4. Acidemia: likely renal in origin, and the patient will require renal failure support. HCO3- may be considered for further worsening combined with worsening tachypnea.
5. Acute Renal Failure: intrinsic renal insult is suspected, and further definition of the source is needed. Renal ultrasound, urine sediment, and adequate volume support will be maintained.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

* Severe hyperkalemia leading to cardiac arrhythmias or arrest
* Pneumonia worsening, potentially leading to respiratory failure or sepsis
* Acute renal failure progressing to end-stage renal disease
* Metabolic acidosis worsening, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias or arrest
* Fever and hyperthermia potentially leading to heat stroke or cardiac complications

The patient's ICU care plan includes nutrition via a peroral diet, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's disposition is ICU care, and their status is full code."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) who presented to the clinic with rigors, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and acute-on-chronic renal failure. He was admitted for workup and became agitated in the CT, requiring IV Ativan. He is currently being treated for pneumonia (PNA) and hyperkalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia is likely due to renal insufficiency or a consequence of his non-anion-gap metabolic acidosis. If left untreated, hyperkalemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and even cardiac arrest.
2. Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may be a result of impaired ammonium excretion secondary to decreasing kidney function. If not treated, it can lead to severe acidosis, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and even cardiac arrest.
3. Acute-on-Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is above his baseline, indicating intrinsic renal deficiency. If left untreated, acute-on-chronic renal failure can lead to further kidney damage, electrolyte imbalances, and even death.
4. Respiratory Complications: The patient's pneumonia may lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CAD and chronic diastolic heart failure puts him at risk for cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and even cardiac arrest.
6. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and fever may indicate an underlying infection, which can lead to sepsis and even death if not treated promptly.
7. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and metabolic acidosis may lead to electrolyte imbalances, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and even cardiac arrest.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo male admit with hyperkalemia and hypoxia evolving in the setting
   of altered mental status.  This is in the setting of significant renal
   failure with anion gap acidosis.
   1)Hyperkalemia-
   -Corrected to normal range
   -Was likely related to renal failure
   -Has improved with Rx
   -MOve to qd checking
   2)Respiratory Failure/Respiratory Distress- [**Month (only) 8**] be component of
   aspiration pneumonitis and pneumonia
   -Urine Legionella and Influenza
negative
   -Continue with 7 day course of antibiotics
   -Pulomonary Edema was clearly present yesterday with need for mild
   diuresis and move to even balance today given acute pulmonary edema
   yesterday
   3)Altered Mental Status-Likley multifactorial metabolic insult as
   defined in the initial admission process.   He does have some
   significant improvement with treatment for pneumonia and improved
   stabilization of his volume status.
   -Continue to follow exam
   -Will need to consider patient baseline in formulation of change
   4)Acute Renal Failure
Patient baseline presumed to be near 2.0
   -Continue hydration
   -Will expect to move to baseline with stability of volume status in the
   setting of cardiac dysfunction and need for diuresis
   5)Acidosis
Patient with evolution of anion gap acidosis.  This has
   evolved over past days from non-gap to anion gap.
   -Will pursue ABG for definition of acidemia or alkalemia
   -As initial pass will look to lactate and ketones for possible source
   -This was similar at presentation but the AG is up a bit from admission
   in what should be a path to improvement

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male admitted with hyperkalemia, hypoxia, and altered mental status. He has a history of significant renal failure, anion gap acidosis, and is currently receiving treatment for pneumonia and acute pulmonary edema. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/75 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute. His laboratory results show hyperkalemia, anion gap acidosis, and acute renal failure. He is receiving treatment with Lasix, heparin, and antibiotics, and is being monitored closely in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if his oxygenation and ventilation are not closely monitored and managed.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac status is also critical, and there is a risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest if his cardiac function is not closely monitored and managed.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration of his renal function if he does not receive adequate fluid management and treatment for his underlying condition.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections, particularly pneumonia, given his compromised immune system and respiratory status.
5. Metabolic Complications: The patient's metabolic status is also critical, and there is a risk of developing metabolic complications such as hyperkalemia, acidosis, or hypoglycemia if his treatment is not closely monitored and managed.
6. Nutritional Complications: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and there is a risk of developing nutritional complications such as malnutrition or dehydration if he does not receive adequate nutrition and hydration.
7. Psychological Complications: The patient's altered mental status is a concern, and there is a risk of developing psychological complications such as delirium or depression if he is not closely monitored and managed.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU to address his critical medical conditions and prevent potential complications."

 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
 .H/O HYPERKALEMIA (HIGH POTASSIUM, HYPERPOTASSEMIA)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Assessment:  81 year-old male with a history of CML who presented to
   clinic with rigors, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis and
   acute-on-chronic renal failure.  Admitted for workup and became acutely
   agitated in CT.  Received iv ativan x1 and became unresponsive.
   # Altered Mental Status:  Appears to be resolving, though expressive
   aphasia is more prominent than before.  This may be a result of an
   increased lucidity following normalization of his electrolytes. Unclear
   if this is his baseline. Patient
s daughter is coming in today, so will
   speak to her regarding his baseline. No focal deficits on exam, and CT
   scan of 2 days ago showed no acute process. Unlikely to be related to
   pneumonia, as he has been treated with antibiotics for 3 days, has not
   been febrile, and does not have a leukocytosis. DFA negative, so
   influenza unlikely.
   -Urine legionella, C.Diff, and DFA are all negative.
   -Would consider repeat CT scan or MRI if symptoms worsen or patient is
   not at baseline.
   #Pneumonia: Patient has congestion of pulmonary vessels on CXR, but
   this may be an evolving pneumonia. Patient has been saturating well on
   3L, so O2 via NC has been discontinued. Now saturating 94% on RA.
   - Ceftriaxone and azithromycin x 7 days (Today = Day 3)
   - No CXR necessary for tomorrow morning as yet.
   # Hyperkalemia:  Resolving. Normal this morning at 4.8. Unclear cause,
   likely due to renal insufficiency or a consequence of his chronic
   metabolic acidosis. Will not start calcium gluconate yet because there
   are no PR interval changes on the ECG.
   -Will check K level again at 5 PM
   -Bicarbonate repletion
   -If needed, would add D50 bolus with 10 U insulin to correct, or
   Kayexelate PR PRN.
   #Acid/base status: ABG of 7.49/18/73 and bicarbonate of 15. This is
   likely a respiratory compensation for a chronic metabolic acidosis,
   which may be due to his underlying kidney disease, or may be due to
   chronic hyperkalemia (H+/K+ membrane exchange). He has evolved from a
   non-anion gap to anion gap acidosis, but ABG reveals an alkalemia.
   Albumin levels are normal at 4.5. Lactate level of 1.5 makes lactic
   acidosis unlikely, urine was negative for ketones, so DKA unlikely.
   Patient previously had a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis yesterday of
   which the differential diagnosis included diarrhea or type 1, 2, 4 RTA,
   hyperalimentation, or normal saline fluid overload. Renal ultrasound
   showed no evidence of hydronephrosis and an incidental left renal cyst.
   -Will obtain urine Na, Cr, Cl, and Osm to calculate urinary anion gap
   and fractional excretion of sodium
   -Would obtain renal consult to ascertain other possible etiologies
   -Will treat with bicarbonate as above
   -Continue to monitor urine output (3245 mL in the past 24 hours)
   -Will obtain U/A for urine pH
   # Acute-on-Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine of 2.4 is above baseline
   of 1.5-2. FeNa yesterday was 2.5, which indicated renal etiology, and
   is unlikely to have changed over the interval.
   - Urinary electrolytes and Osm as above
   - Would consider renal consult as above
   - Goal I/O: even. 250 mL normal saline boluses PRN
   hypotension/tachycardia.
   # CML: On dasatinib, followed here by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 221**]. Per last note by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 221**], patient has been tolerating dasatinib. Current dose of 50mg
   daily.
   - Will monitor for s/s of bone marrow suppression. Daily CBC.
   - f/u onc recs
   # Hyponatremia: Likely result of chronic renal failure. [**Month (only) 8**] be SIADH as
   patient has neurologic involvement, but may also be volume depletion.
   Serum cortisol is high at 29.7, which may be a stress response to his
   pneumonia, but rules out adrenal insufficiency and Type 1 RTA.
   - Urine electrolytes as above
   # CAD s/p CABG [**2114**] (LBBB on previous EKG): Stable. Home dose
   metoprolol restarted yesterday as BP has stabilized. Not on a statin or
   ACE-I- would consider starting these as outpatient.
   -Continue metoprolol
   -Continue ASA
   # Chronic Diasolic heart failure. (EF 50%): No peripheral edema. Pacer
   in place with HR ~ 80 bpm.
   -Will continue gentle fluid correction with 250mL saline bolus as above
   and continue to monitor.
    # HTN: Stable. Continue to monitor. Continue metoprolol.
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable. Would consider statin as outpatient but
   would not start now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following are the key findings and potential medical complications:

**Key Findings:**

1. The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is not fully understood, but may be related to chronic kidney disease, hyperkalemia, or chronic metabolic acidosis.
2. The patient has hyperkalemia, which is resolving, but the cause is unclear, and may be related to renal insufficiency or chronic metabolic acidosis.
3. The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.4, which is above his baseline of 1.5-2.
4. The patient has pneumonia, which is being treated with antibiotics, and has congestion of pulmonary vessels on CXR.
5. The patient has altered mental status, which is resolving, but may be related to electrolyte imbalances or chronic kidney disease.
6. The patient has chronic kidney disease, chronic diasolic heart failure, and hypertension.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Acid-base imbalance:** The patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further respiratory and cardiovascular complications.
2. **Hyperkalemia:** If not managed properly, hyperkalemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation, which can be life-threatening.
3. **Acute-on-chronic renal failure:** The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and if not managed properly, can lead to further renal damage, electrolyte imbalances, and cardiovascular complications.
4. **Pneumonia:** The patient's pneumonia may worsen if not properly treated, leading to respiratory failure, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction.
5. **Electrolyte imbalances:** The patient's electrolyte imbalances, including hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, may worsen if not properly managed, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and neurological symptoms.
6. **Chronic kidney disease:** The patient's chronic kidney disease may progress if not managed properly, leading to further renal damage, electrolyte imbalances, and cardiovascular complications.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's acid-base status and adjust treatment as necessary.
2. Continue to manage the patient's hyperkalemia, and consider adding calcium gluconate or Kayexelate if necessary.
3. Continue to treat the patient's pneumonia with antibiotics, and consider adding respiratory support if necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte imbalances, including hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, and adjust treatment as necessary.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, an 81-year-old male with a history of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with altered mental status, tachypnea, tachycardia, and pneumonia. He has been receiving antibiotics and supportive care, with significant improvement in his mental status. However, he still has persistent tachypnea and respiratory alkalosis. His laboratory results show hyperkalemia, which has resolved, and non-AG acidosis, likely related to a renal source.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent tachypnea and respiratory alkalosis may indicate underlying respiratory failure, which could worsen if not addressed.
2. Pneumonia progression: The patient's pneumonia is not fully cleared, and further imaging may be necessary to assess the extent of the infection.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's non-AG acidosis and hyperkalemia may indicate underlying renal insufficiency, which could worsen if not managed properly.
4. Altered mental status: Although the patient's mental status has improved, he is still at risk for further deterioration if not closely monitored.
5. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and hyperkalemia may indicate underlying sepsis, which could worsen if not treated promptly.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hyperkalemia may indicate an underlying electrolyte imbalance, which could worsen if not managed properly.
7. Infection control: The patient's presence in the ICU increases the risk of infection transmission to other patients and healthcare workers.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and supportive care for the patient's pneumonia.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider further imaging to assess the extent of the infection.
3. Manage the patient's renal insufficiency by adjusting his fluid and electrolyte management.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust his care plan accordingly.
5. Consider consulting a nephrologist for long-term management of the patient's renal insufficiency.
6. Implement infection control measures to prevent transmission of infection to other patients and healthcare workers."

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
 .H/O HYPERKALEMIA (HIGH POTASSIUM, HYPERPOTASSEMIA)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Assessment:  81 year-old male with a history of CML who presented to
   clinic with rigors, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis and
   acute-on-chronic renal failure.  Admitted for workup and became acutely
   agitated in CT.  Received iv ativan x1 and became unresponsive.
   #Pneumonia: Patient has congestion of pulmonary vessels on CXR, but
   this may be an evolving pneumonia. Patient has been saturating well on
   3L, so O2 via NC has been discontinued. Now saturating 98% on RA.
   - Ceftriaxone x 7 days (Today = Day 4) and Azithromycin x 5 days (Today
   = Day 4)
   - No CXR necessary as symptoms are resolving and patient is saturating
   well.
   #Alkalemia/Metabolic acidosis: ABG of 7.46/22/89 and bicarbonate of 13.
   Anion gap of 15, Delta/Delta of 6, Urinary anion gap of 46. This
   complicated picture is likely a respiratory alkalosis driven by
   tachypnea secondary to pneumonia, and a chronic metabolic acidosis,
   which may be due to his underlying kidney disease (the positive urinary
   anion gap is concerning for Type 4 RTA), or may be due to chronic
   hyperkalemia (H+/K+ membrane exchange). He has evolved from a non-anion
   gap to anion gap acidosis. Albumin levels are normal at 4.5. Lactate
   level of 1.5 makes lactic acidosis unlikely, urine was negative for
   ketones, so DKA unlikely. Patient previously had a non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis yesterday of which the differential diagnosis
   included diarrhea or type 1, 2, 4 RTA, hyperalimentation, or normal
   saline fluid overload. Patient has not been on carbonic anhydrase
   inhibitors as far as can be ascertained. As hyponatremia has resolved,
   this is unlikely to be a type 1 RTA. Renal ultrasound showed no
   evidence of hydronephrosis and an incidental left renal cyst.
   - Will replete bicarbonate with 1300mg NaHCO3 [**Hospital1 **] (36 mEq bicarb/day)
   - Continue to monitor urine output (1150 mL in the past 24 hours)
   - Treating pneumonia as above
   # Hyperkalemia:  Resolving. Normal this morning at 4.7. Unclear cause,
   likely due to renal insufficiency or a consequence of his chronic
   metabolic acidosis. Will not start calcium gluconate yet because there
   are no PR interval changes on the ECG.
   -Will continue to monitor q day
   -If needed, would add D50 bolus with 10 U insulin to correct, or
   Kayexelate PR PRN.
   # Altered Mental Status:  Appears to be resolving, as patient
   expressive aphasia has decreased markedly since yesterday. Unclear if
   this is his baseline. No focal deficits on exam, and CT scan of 2 days
   ago showed no acute process. Unlikely to be related to pneumonia, as he
   has been treated with antibiotics for 3 days, has not been febrile, and
   does not have a leukocytosis. DFA negative, so influenza unlikely.
   -Urine legionella, C.Diff, and DFA are all negative.
   -RPR pending per BMT recommendations
   -Would consider repeat CT scan or MRI if symptoms worsen or patient is
   not at baseline.
    # Acute-on-Chronic Renal Failure: New FeNa of 0.9% suggests prerenal
   etiology in addition to his chronic intrinsic renal failure. Creatinine
   of 2.1 is above baseline of 1.5-2, but has been trending downwards from
   about ~2.5. FeNa yesterday was 2.5, which indicated renal etiology,
   however, new FeNa suggests a pre-renal etiology. Likely both factors
   are present.
   - Goal I/O: even. 250 mL normal saline boluses PRN
   hypotension/tachycardia.
   # CML: On dasatinib, followed here by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 221**]. Per last note by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 221**], patient has been tolerating dasatinib. Current dose of 50mg
   daily.
   - Will monitor for s/s of bone marrow suppression. Daily CBC.
   - f/u onc recs
   # Hyponatremia: Resolving. Normal today at 135. Likely result of
   chronic renal failure. [**Month (only) 8**] be SIADH as patient has neurologic
   involvement, but may also be volume depletion. Serum cortisol is high
   at 29.7, which may be a stress response to his pneumonia, but rules out
   adrenal insufficiency and Type 1 RTA.
   - Urine electrolytes as above
   # CAD s/p CABG [**2114**] (LBBB on previous EKG): Stable. Home dose
   metoprolol restarted yesterday as BP has stabilized. Not on a statin or
   ACE-I- would consider starting these as outpatient.
   -Continue metoprolol
   -Continue ASA
   # Chronic Diasolic heart failure. (EF 50%): No peripheral edema. Pacer
   in place with HR ~ 80 bpm.
   -Will continue gentle fluid correction with 250mL saline bolus as above
   and continue to monitor.
    # HTN: Stable. Continue to monitor. Continue metoprolol.
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable. Would consider statin as outpatient but
   would not start now.
   #Access: Patient has PIV. Can remove right EJ

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   of 2.1 is above baseline of 1.5-2, but has been trending downwards from
   about ~2.5. FeNa yesterday was 2.5, which indicated renal etiology,
   however, new FeNa suggests a pre-renal etiology. Likely both factors
   are present.
   - Goal I/O: even. 250 mL normal saline boluses PRN
   hypotension/tachycardia.
   # CML: On dasatinib, followed here by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 221**]. Per last note by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 221**], patient has been tolerating dasatinib. Current dose of 50mg
   daily.
   - Will monitor for s/s of bone marrow suppression. Daily CBC.
   - f/u onc recs
   # Hyponatremia: Resolving. Normal today at 135. Likely result of
   chronic renal failure. [**Month (only) 8**] be SIADH as patient has neurologic
   involvement, but may also be volume depletion. Serum cortisol is high
   at 29.7, which may be a stress response to his pneumonia, but rules out
   adrenal insufficiency and Type 1 RTA.
   - Urine electrolytes as above
   # CAD s/p CABG [**2114**] (LBBB on previous EKG): Stable. Home dose
   metoprolol restarted yesterday as BP has stabilized. Not on a statin or
   ACE-I- would consider starting these as outpatient.
   -Continue metoprolol
   -Continue ASA
   # Chronic Diasolic heart failure. (EF 50%): No peripheral edema. Pacer
   in place with HR ~ 80 bpm.
   -Will continue gentle fluid correction with 250mL saline bolus as above
   and continue to monitor.
    # HTN: Stable. Continue to monitor. Continue metoprolol.
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Stable. Would consider statin as outpatient but
   would not start now.
   #Access: Patient has PIV. Can remove right EJ
   ICU Care
