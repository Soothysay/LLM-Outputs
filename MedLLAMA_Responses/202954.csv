   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2159-7-29**]
   - Coughed up ~10ccs [**Known firstname **] red blood at 11pm.  Morning [**7-30**] coughing up
   small amount dark brown substance.  Larger amount aspirated from NG
   Tube  ? swallowed blood.
   .
   - CT Head obtained, preliminary read:  bilateral basal ganglion
   hypodensity concerning for acute infarction (confirmed with Radiology
   Fellow), bilateral involvement consistent with anoxic event, atleast
   3-4 hours post event; MRI would be helpful if patient stable
   - Given 2L D5 with 150mEq bicarbonate with only minimal improvement in
   urine output; able to wean dopamine significantly but patient became
   bradycardic with complete discontinuation
   - DNR status confirmed with family
   .
   - Thoracic Surgery consulted to manage chest tube, though appears port
   in chest wall, reportedly fine without air-leak; continue as we are
   - Neurology contact, will have formal consult on [**Name (NI) 501**] s/p re-warming
   but recommended EEG in interim
   - A-line placed for improved BP monitoring and weaning of pressors

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with h/o CABG 7 yrs ago, s/p [**Hospital3 **] ICD (5yrs ago), afib on
   coumadin, COPD presented with acute episode respiratory distress, PEA
   arrest s/p CPR/ACLS and now on pressors and cooling protocol.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6
   hours warming (unclear start time per outside hospital records, given
   EMS records, will presume 0200, so cooled until [**2150**]).  Now rewarmed.
   - Q8H lytes
   - cardiac arrest team involved, appreciate recs
   - wean down on pressors, starting with dopamine, keeping MAP>60
   - order for continuous 48hr bedside EEG per protocol
   - Formal Neuro consult this AM, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2204**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; will have formal
   consultation and recs RE: prognosis & clinical outcomes
   - SW consult
   - Pt enrolled in steroid clinical trial
   - Family meeting this morning
   .
   # Respiratory failure: s/p intubation initially difficult to ventilate
   with high auto PEEP, PIP.   Patient with h/o asthma and concern for
   bronchospasm on exam.  No h/o COPD per available records.  Improved
   with aggressive broncodilator therapy.
   - repeat CXR
   - Schedule Albuterol / Ipratroprium  &  PRN Albuterol
   .
   # CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG (unknown anatomy). No localized ischemia
   on ECGs, cardiac enzymes elevated but s/p compressions, however cannot
   exclude ischemic event
   - enzymes trending down, will recheck as needed
   .
   # PUMP: EF 25% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**2158-6-25**] ETT.
   - order for TTE, can get emergently if any hemodynamic
   compromise/evidence of acute ischemia
   .
   # RHYTHM: V-paced, pacer interrogated showing oversensitivity leading
   to 2 episodes of inappropriate ICD firing at OSH, none since. Patient
   therapeutic on prior coumadin.  Discontinued Amiodarone gtt upon
   arrival to CCU.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - history of chronic atrial fibrillation; now with changing rhythm on
   telemetry, some AVIR
   .
   # s/p R chest tube for small R apical pneumothorax; now with some
   oozing.  Thoracics following.
   - CXR with side port in chest wall, fine by Thoracics unless develops
   airleak
   - repeat CXR; obtain daily CXR
   - follow chest tube output
   - monitor Hct as chest tube output bloody
   .
   # Asthma: Patient with reported h/o asthma, bronchospastic on exam.
   - aggressive standing neb treatment
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Baseline 1.2.  Likely some component of ATN
   given s/p PEA arrest x 2.  UOP poor.
   - Monitor uop / Cr
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis / Metabolic Acidosis: Patient with mixed acid
   [**Last Name 3300**] problem.  Lactic acidosis.  Also with h/o COPD.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest. He has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and is anticoagulated with coumadin. He presented with acute respiratory distress, which led to a PEA arrest. He was resuscitated and now requires mechanical ventilation and pressors.

The patient has a number of medical conditions, including ischemic cardiomyopathy, chronic atrial fibrillation, COPD, and asthma. He has a history of cardiac arrest and is currently being managed with a cooling protocol.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 34.1°C (93.4°F)
* Heart rate: 66 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 94/62 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's physical examination is notable for a non-reactive gag reflex, absent bowel sounds, and a decreased level of consciousness. He has a chest tube in place and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results are notable for:

* Elevated troponin levels
* Elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels
* Elevated lactate levels
* Metabolic acidosis
* Renal insufficiency

The patient's imaging studies are notable for:

* A CT scan of the head showing bilateral basal ganglion hypodensity, consistent with anoxic injury
* A TTE showing an EF of 25% and moderate-severe mitral regurgitation

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued mechanical ventilation and pressors
* Cooling protocol
* Cardiac arrest team involvement
* Formal neurology consult
* SW consult
* Patient enrolled in steroid clinical trial
* Family meeting
* Repeat CXR
* Schedule Albuterol and Ipratroprium
* Order for TTE
* Monitor on telemetry
* Follow chest tube output
* Monitor Hct

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Respiratory failure
* Renal failure
* Sepsis
* Stroke
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Pulmonary embolism

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to ensure that he is receiving appropriate treatment and to identify any potential complications early on."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with h/o CABG 7 yrs ago, s/p [**Hospital3 **] ICD (5yrs ago), afib on
   coumadin, COPD presented with acute episode respiratory distress, PEA
   arrest s/p CPR/ACLS and now on pressors and cooling protocol.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6
   hours warming (unclear start time per outside hospital records, given
   EMS records, will presume 0200, so cooled until [**2150**]).  Now rewarmed.
   - Q8H lytes now that pt has been rewarmed
   - cardiac arrest team involved, appreciate recs
   - wean down on pressors, starting with dopamine, keeping MAP>60
   - order for continuous 48hr bedside EEG per protocol
   - Formal Neuro consult this AM, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2204**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; will have formal
   consultation and recs RE: prognosis & clinical outcomes
   - SW consult for family coping
   - Pt enrolled in steroid clinical trial
   - Family meeting this morning
   .
   # Respiratory failure: s/p intubation initially difficult to ventilate
   with high auto PEEP, PIP.   Patient with h/o asthma and concern for
   bronchospasm on exam.  No h/o COPD per available records.  Improved
   with aggressive broncodilator therapy.
   - repeat CXR
   - Will move ETT down 3cm and repeat CXR afterwards
   - Adjust mech vent settings (? Increase TV)
   - Schedule Albuterol / Ipratroprium  &  PRN Albuterol
   .
   # CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG (unknown anatomy). No localized ischemia
   on ECGs, cardiac enzymes elevated but s/p compressions, however cannot
   exclude ischemic event
   - enzymes trending down, will recheck as needed
 none for now
   - Repeat EKG this AM and another tomorrow AM
   .
   # PUMP: EF 25% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**2158-6-25**] ETT.
   - order for TTE, can get emergently if any hemodynamic
   compromise/evidence of acute ischemia
   .
   # RHYTHM: V-paced, pacer interrogated showing oversensitivity leading
   to 2 episodes of inappropriate ICD firing at OSH, none since. Patient
   therapeutic on prior coumadin.  Discontinued Amiodarone gtt upon
   arrival to CCU.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - history of chronic atrial fibrillation; now with changing rhythm on
   telemetry, some AVIR
   .
   # s/p R chest tube for small R apical pneumothorax; now with some
   oozing.  Thoracics following.
   - CXR with side port in chest wall, fine by Thoracics unless develops
   airleak
   - repeat CXR; obtain daily CXR
   - follow chest tube output
   - monitor Hct as chest tube output bloody
   .
   # Asthma: Patient with reported h/o asthma, bronchospastic on exam.
   - aggressive standing neb treatment
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Baseline 1.2.  Likely some component of ATN
   given s/p PEA arrest x 2.  UOP poor.
   - Monitor uop / Cr
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis / Metabolic Acidosis: Patient with mixed acid
   [**Last Name 3300**] problem.  Lactic acidosis.  Also with h/o COPD.
   - Ventilator management with increased Vt
   - Will move ETT down 3cm and repeat CXR afterwards
   - Adjust mech vent settings (? Increase TV) to compensate for
   respiratory acidosis
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO; will start PPI and guaic gastric contents

   Prophylaxis:
   DVT:  Systemic anticoagulation (Coumadin at home
 being held in CCU;
   remains therapeutic)
   VAP:  HOB, Chlorhexidate
   Communication:  Plan to have family meeting this morning
   Code status:  DNR (patient intubated)
   Disposition: CCU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and atrial fibrillation. He presented with acute respiratory distress and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which was treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and ACLS.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a high auto PEEP and PIP. He has a history of asthma and bronchospasm, and is being treated with aggressive bronchodilator therapy.
* Cardiac: has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25%, with marked right ventricular (RV) dilation and hypokinesis. He has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation and is currently paced.
* Neurological: has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3, with minimal withdrawal to painful stimuli and no purposeful movement. His pupils are non-reactive.
* Renal: has a baseline creatinine level of 1.2, which is likely related to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to the PEA arrest.
* Metabolic: has a mixed acid-base disorder with respiratory acidosis and metabolic acidosis.
* Hemodynamic: is receiving pressors, including dopamine and norepinephrine, to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: the patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require further adjustments to his ventilator settings or consideration for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
* Cardiac complications: the patient's cardiac function is impaired, and he may be at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
* Neurological complications: the patient's neurological status is concerning, and he may be at risk for further neurological decline or even death.
* Renal complications: the patient's renal function is impaired, and he may require further supportive care or dialysis.
* Metabolic complications: the patient's mixed acid-base disorder may require further management, including adjustment of his ventilator settings or administration of buffer therapy.
* Hemodynamic complications: the patient's hemodynamic instability may require further adjustments to his pressors or consideration for vasopressin therapy.

In summary, the patient is a complex case with multiple organ dysfunction and a high risk of further complications. He requires close monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male who presented with acute respiratory distress, pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, and subsequent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The patient has a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 7 years ago, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) 5 years ago, and chronic atrial fibrillation (AFib) on coumadin.

The patient's current condition is critical, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3, indicating severe brain injury. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 325, indicating severe hypoxemia. His blood pressure is 94/62 mmHg, and his heart rate is 66 beats per minute (bpm). He has a fixed dilated pupil on the left, indicating possible uncal herniation.

The patient has a history of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but no prior records are available in the hospital system. He has a small right-sided pneumothorax, which was treated with a chest tube. He is also on pressors, including dopamine and norepinephrine, and is being cooled to prevent further neurological injury.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 12.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 170,000/μL
* White blood cell count: 16.9 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.56 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 3.5 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.4 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.6 mg/dL

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe hypoxemia and hypercapnia, requiring mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient had a PEA arrest, which was treated with CPR and pressors.
3. Hypothermia: The patient is being cooled to prevent further neurological injury.
4. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
5. Lactic acidosis: The patient has mild lactic acidosis, which may be related to his cardiac arrest and hypoperfusion.
6. Respiratory acidosis: The patient has a mixed acid-base disorder, with a pH of 7.27 and a PCO2 of 46 mmHg.
7. Pneumothorax: The patient has a small right-sided pneumothorax, which was treated with a chest tube.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is at risk for developing sepsis.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he may be at risk for developing acute kidney injury.
3. Neurological injury: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and hypoperfusion, which may have caused neurological injury.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe hypoxemia and hypercapnia, which may lead to respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of AFib and may be at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Hemorrhage: The patient has a small pneumothorax and may be at risk for developing hemorrhage.

In conclusion, the patient is a critical care patient with multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, hypothermia, renal insufficiency, lactic acidosis, and pneumothorax. He requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and optimize his outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with h/o CABG 7 yrs ago, s/p [**Hospital3 **] ICD (5yrs ago), afib on
   coumadin, COPD presented with acute episode respiratory distress, PEA
   arrest s/p CPR/ACLS and now on pressors and cooling protocol.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6
   hours warming (unclear start time per outside hospital records, given
   EMS records, will presume 0200, so cooled until [**2150**]).  Now rewarmed.
   - Q8H lytes
   - cardiac arrest team involved, appreciate recs
   - wean down on pressors, starting with dopamine, keeping MAP>60
   - order for continuous 48hr bedside EEG per protocol
   - Formal Neuro consult this AM, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2204**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; will have formal
   consultation and recs RE: prognosis & clinical outcomes
   - SW consult
   - Pt enrolled in steroid clinical trial
   - Family meeting this morning
   .
   # Respiratory failure: s/p intubation initially difficult to ventilate
   with high auto PEEP, PIP.   Patient with h/o asthma and concern for
   bronchospasm on exam.  No h/o COPD per available records.  Improved
   with aggressive broncodilator therapy.
   - repeat CXR
   - Schedule Albuterol / Ipratroprium  &  PRN Albuterol
   .
   # CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG (unknown anatomy). No localized ischemia
   on ECGs, cardiac enzymes elevated but s/p compressions, however cannot
   exclude ischemic event
   - enzymes trending down, will recheck as needed
   .
   # PUMP: EF 25% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**2158-6-25**] ETT.
   - order for TTE, can get emergently if any hemodynamic
   compromise/evidence of acute ischemia
   .
   # RHYTHM: V-paced, pacer interrogated showing oversensitivity leading
   to 2 episodes of inappropriate ICD firing at OSH, none since. Patient
   therapeutic on prior coumadin.  Discontinued Amiodarone gtt upon
   arrival to CCU.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - history of chronic atrial fibrillation; now with changing rhythm on
   telemetry, some AVIR
   .
   # s/p R chest tube for small R apical pneumothorax; now with some
   oozing.  Thoracics following.
   - CXR with side port in chest wall, fine by Thoracics unless develops
   airleak
   - repeat CXR; obtain daily CXR
   - follow chest tube output
   - monitor Hct as chest tube output bloody
   .
   # Asthma: Patient with reported h/o asthma, bronchospastic on exam.
   - aggressive standing neb treatment
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Baseline 1.2.  Likely some component of ATN
   given s/p PEA arrest x 2.  UOP poor.
   - Monitor uop / Cr
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis / Metabolic Acidosis: Patient with mixed acid
   [**Last Name 3300**] problem.  Lactic acidosis.  Also with h/o COPD.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is an 82-year-old male who presented with acute respiratory distress, PEA arrest, and was resuscitated. He has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 7 years ago, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) 5 years ago, and chronic atrial fibrillation on coumadin. He has a small right-sided pneumothorax and is currently on pressors and a cooling protocol. He has a history of asthma and COPD, and is currently intubated.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cardiac Complications:**
	* Ischemic event due to underlying coronary artery disease
	* Cardiac tamponade due to pneumothorax
	* Arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia
	* Cardiac arrest due to electrolyte imbalance or other underlying conditions
2. **Respiratory Complications:**
	* Respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
	* Pneumonia or other secondary infections
	* Pneumothorax or hemothorax
	* Bronchospasm or asthma exacerbation
3. **Renal Complications:**
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypovolemia, sepsis, or other underlying conditions
	* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression
	* Electrolyte imbalance due to kidney dysfunction
4. **Neurological Complications:**
	* Cerebral edema or infarction due to cardiac arrest or other underlying conditions
	* Seizures or status epilepticus due to electrolyte imbalance or other underlying conditions
	* Neurological deficits due to cardiac arrest or other underlying conditions
5. **Infectious Complications:**
	* Sepsis or septic shock due to secondary infections
	* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections
	* Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs)
6. **Other Complications:**
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to anticoagulation therapy
	* Hepatic dysfunction or failure due to liver disease or other underlying conditions
	* Hematological complications, such as anemia, bleeding, or thrombocytopenia

**Assessment and Plan:**

The patient is currently on pressors and a cooling protocol, and is being monitored for cardiac rhythm disturbances and other potential complications. The plan is to wean down on pressors, continue to manage respiratory failure, and monitor for signs of cardiac ischemia or infarction. The patient will also be evaluated for potential neurological deficits and infectious complications."

   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6
   hours warming (unclear start time per outside hospital records, given
   EMS records, will presume 0200, so cooled until [**2150**]).  Now rewarmed.
   - Q8H lytes now that pt has been rewarmed
   - cardiac arrest team involved, appreciate recs
   - wean down on pressors, starting with dopamine, keeping MAP>60
   - order for continuous 48hr bedside EEG per protocol
   - Formal Neuro consult this AM, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2204**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; will have formal
   consultation and recs RE: prognosis & clinical outcomes

   Additional comments:
   no improvement other than some mild eeg improvement
   hemodynamically less stable - now requiring pressors for hypotension
   no arrhythmias
   continue supportive care including antibiotics and vasopressors
   if no meaningful neurological improvement will discuss withdrawal of

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with h/o CABG 7 yrs ago, s/p [**Hospital3 **] ICD (5yrs ago), afib on
   coumadin, COPD presented with acute episode respiratory distress, PEA
   arrest s/p CPR/ACLS and now on pressors and cooling protocol.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6
   hours warming (unclear start time per outside hospital records, given
   EMS records, will presume 0200, so cooled until [**2150**]).  Now rewarmed.
   - Q8H lytes now that pt has been rewarmed
   - cardiac arrest team involved, appreciate recs
   - wean down on pressors, starting with dopamine, keeping MAP>60
   - order for continuous 48hr bedside EEG per protocol
   - Formal Neuro consult this AM, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2204**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; will have formal
   consultation and recs RE: prognosis & clinical outcomes
   - SW consult for family coping
   - Pt enrolled in steroid clinical trial
   - Family meeting this morning
   .
   # Respiratory failure: s/p intubation initially difficult to ventilate
   with high auto PEEP, PIP.   Patient with h/o asthma and concern for
   bronchospasm on exam.  No h/o COPD per available records.  Improved
   with aggressive broncodilator therapy.
   - repeat CXR
   - Will move ETT down 3cm and repeat CXR afterwards
   - Adjust mech vent settings (? Increase TV)
   - Schedule Albuterol / Ipratroprium  &  PRN Albuterol
   .
   # CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG (unknown anatomy). No localized ischemia
   on ECGs, cardiac enzymes elevated but s/p compressions, however cannot
   exclude ischemic event
   - enzymes trending down, will recheck as needed
 none for now
   - Repeat EKG this AM and another tomorrow AM
   .
   # PUMP: EF 25% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**2158-6-25**] ETT.
   - order for TTE, can get emergently if any hemodynamic
   compromise/evidence of acute ischemia
   .
   # RHYTHM: V-paced, pacer interrogated showing oversensitivity leading
   to 2 episodes of inappropriate ICD firing at OSH, none since. Patient
   therapeutic on prior coumadin.  Discontinued Amiodarone gtt upon
   arrival to CCU.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - history of chronic atrial fibrillation; now with changing rhythm on
   telemetry, some AVIR
   .
   # s/p R chest tube for small R apical pneumothorax; now with some
   oozing.  Thoracics following.
   - CXR with side port in chest wall, fine by Thoracics unless develops
   airleak
   - repeat CXR; obtain daily CXR
   - follow chest tube output
   - monitor Hct as chest tube output bloody
   .
   # Asthma: Patient with reported h/o asthma, bronchospastic on exam.
   - aggressive standing neb treatment
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Baseline 1.2.  Likely some component of ATN
   given s/p PEA arrest x 2.  UOP poor.
   - Monitor uop / Cr
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis / Metabolic Acidosis: Patient with mixed acid
   [**Last Name 3300**] problem.  Lactic acidosis.  Also with h/o COPD.
   - Ventilator management with increased Vt
   - Will move ETT down 3cm and repeat CXR afterwards
   - Adjust mech vent settings (? Increase TV) to compensate for
   respiratory acidosis

   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   no improvement other than some mild eeg improvement
   hemodynamically less stable - now requiring pressors for hypotension
   no arrhythmias
   continue supportive care including antibiotics and vasopressors
   if no meaningful neurological improvement will discuss withdrawal of
   care - have discussed this plan extensively with wife and son

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest. He has a history of coronary artery disease, chronic atrial fibrillation, COPD, and asthma. He was resuscitated and intubated, and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and pressors. He has a bilateral pneumothorax, which was treated with a chest tube. He also has a history of cardiac arrest and is currently in a state of hypovolemic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he may develop respiratory failure due to his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, and he may be at risk for another cardiac arrest due to his underlying cardiac conditions.
3. Pneumothorax: The patient has a bilateral pneumothorax, which may lead to respiratory compromise and further complications.
4. Renal insufficiency: The patient has a history of renal insufficiency, and his condition may worsen due to his hypovolemic shock and respiratory failure.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a mixed acid-base disorder, which may lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory failure.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his prolonged hospital stay and the presence of a chest tube.
7. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and is currently in a state of hypovolemic shock, which may lead to neurological complications such as stroke or seizures.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and aggressive management of his respiratory, cardiac, and renal status. He should be continued on mechanical ventilation and pressors to support his blood pressure. He should also receive aggressive treatment for his pneumothorax and respiratory failure. The patient's family should be informed of his condition and the potential complications that may arise."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   7/6/009
   - Neuro recs: EEG improved but still ""doing poorly."" Will reassess
   tomorrow. Will continue to recheck. If worsens, consider Midazolam
   levels. If [**Last Name (LF) 7542**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] check SPECT blood flow study to confirm.
   - TTE: Suboptimal [**2-26**] vent. Read pending
   - Head CT (final read): Bilateral basal ganglia hypodensity,
   specifically involving the lentiform nuclei and caudate nuclei that in
   the current mechanism of PEA arrest, is highly concerning for an anoxic
   brain injury. Recommend MR for further evaluation as clinically
   feasible.
   2. Extensive sinus disease involving all of the paranasal sinuses, with
   multiple air-fluid levels seen within the maxillary and ventilate
   sinuses.

   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6
   hours warming

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: CCU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 82-year-old male who presented with acute episode of respiratory distress, PEA arrest, and was successfully resuscitated. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has a respiratory acidosis with a RSBI of 311 and elevated PIP and plateau pressures. He is receiving aggressive bronchodilator therapy and is scheduled for repeat CXR and RSBI monitoring.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a low EF of 25% and is receiving inotropes to maintain a MAP of >60. His cardiac enzymes are trending down, but he may have had an ischemic event.
* Neurological: The patient has a CT scan showing basal ganglia damage consistent with an anoxic brain injury. He has some brainstem reflexes intact, but is non-responsive to verbal stimuli.
* Fever: The patient spiked a temperature of 101.7F and has a pending blood and urine culture. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and has a low risk of VAP.
* Renal: The patient has renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.2 and is at risk for ATN due to his PEA arrest. His urine output is poor.
* Pneumothorax: The patient had a small right apical pneumothorax that was treated with a chest tube and has since resolved.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Weaning down on pressors and starting with dopamine to maintain a MAP of >60
* Repeat CXR and RSBI monitoring
* F/u blood and urine culture
* Daily CXR
* Neuro follow-up with EEG and interpretation
* Pacer interrogation to monitor for oversensitivity
* Family meeting to discuss code status and disposition
* Consideration of steroid clinical trial enrollment

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to inadequate ventilation or worsening of COPD
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to ongoing ischemia or electrolyte imbalance
* Neurological deterioration due to progression of anoxic brain injury
* Renal failure due to ATN or ongoing ischemia
* Sepsis or septic shock due to untreated infection
* Pneumonia or VAP due to inadequate lung protection or prolonged intubation
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to prolonged NPO status and gastric acid suppression"

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with h/o CABG 7 yrs ago, s/p [**Hospital3 **] ICD (5yrs ago), afib on
   coumadin, COPD presented with acute episode respiratory distress, PEA
   arrest s/p CPR/ACLS and now on pressors and cooling protocol.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6
   hours warming (unclear start time per outside hospital records, given
   EMS records, will presume 0200, so cooled until [**2150**]).  Now rewarmed.
   - Q8H lytes now that pt has been rewarmed
   - cardiac arrest team involved, appreciate recs
   - wean down on pressors, starting with dopamine, keeping MAP>60
   - order for continuous 48hr bedside EEG per protocol
   - Formal Neuro consult this AM, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2204**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; will have formal
   consultation and recs RE: prognosis & clinical outcomes
   - SW consult for family coping
   - Pt enrolled in steroid clinical trial
   - Family meeting this morning
   .
   # Respiratory failure: s/p intubation initially difficult to ventilate
   with high auto PEEP, PIP.   Patient with h/o asthma and concern for
   bronchospasm on exam.  No h/o COPD per available records.  Improved
   with aggressive broncodilator therapy.
   - repeat CXR
   - Will move ETT down 3cm and repeat CXR afterwards
   - Adjust mech vent settings (? Increase TV)
   - Schedule Albuterol / Ipratroprium  &  PRN Albuterol
   .
   # CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG (unknown anatomy). No localized ischemia
   on ECGs, cardiac enzymes elevated but s/p compressions, however cannot
   exclude ischemic event
   - enzymes trending down, will recheck as needed
 none for now
   - Repeat EKG this AM and another tomorrow AM
   .
   # PUMP: EF 25% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**2158-6-25**] ETT.
   - order for TTE, can get emergently if any hemodynamic
   compromise/evidence of acute ischemia
   .
   # RHYTHM: V-paced, pacer interrogated showing oversensitivity leading
   to 2 episodes of inappropriate ICD firing at OSH, none since. Patient
   therapeutic on prior coumadin.  Discontinued Amiodarone gtt upon
   arrival to CCU.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - history of chronic atrial fibrillation; now with changing rhythm on
   telemetry, some AVIR
   .
   # s/p R chest tube for small R apical pneumothorax; now with some
   oozing.  Thoracics following.
   - CXR with side port in chest wall, fine by Thoracics unless develops
   airleak
   - repeat CXR; obtain daily CXR
   - follow chest tube output
   - monitor Hct as chest tube output bloody
   .
   # Asthma: Patient with reported h/o asthma, bronchospastic on exam.
   - aggressive standing neb treatment
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Baseline 1.2.  Likely some component of ATN
   given s/p PEA arrest x 2.  UOP poor.
   - Monitor uop / Cr
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis / Metabolic Acidosis: Patient with mixed acid
   [**Last Name 3300**] problem.  Lactic acidosis.  Also with h/o COPD.
   - Ventilator management with increased Vt
   - Will move ETT down 3cm and repeat CXR afterwards
   - Adjust mech vent settings (? Increase TV) to compensate for
   respiratory acidosis

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   7/6/009
   - Neuro recs: EEG improved but still ""doing poorly."" Will reassess
   tomorrow. Will continue to recheck. If worsens, consider Midazolam
   levels. If [**Last Name (LF) 7542**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] check SPECT blood flow study to confirm.
   - TTE: Suboptimal [**2-26**] vent. Read pending
   - Head CT: Bilateral basal ganglia hypodensity, specifically involving
   the lentiform nuclei and caudate nuclei that in the current mechanism
   of PEA arrest, is highly concerning for an anoxic brain injury.
   Recommend MR for further evaluation as clinically feasible.
   2. Extensive sinus disease involving all of the paranasal sinuses, with
   multiple air-fluid levels seen within the maxillary and ventilate
   sinuses.
   - Incr TV, CVP 8-9
   - BP dropping slightly (MAP 80s --> 70s), requiring incr pressors
   - CT oozing blood today, CXR shows no PTX and CT nearly out. CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] to
   come pull CT

   82M with h/o CABG 7 yrs ago, s/p [**Hospital3 **] ICD (5yrs ago), afib on
   coumadin, COPD presented with acute episode respiratory distress, PEA
   arrest s/p CPR/ACLS and now on pressors and cooling protocol.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6
   hours warming (unclear start time per outside hospital records, given
   EMS records, will presume 0200, so cooled until [**2150**]).  Now rewarmed.
   - Q8H lytes now that pt has been rewarmed
   - cardiac arrest team involved, appreciate recs
   - wean down on pressors, starting with dopamine, keeping MAP>60
   - order for continuous 48hr bedside EEG per protocol
   - Formal Neuro consult this AM, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2204**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; will have formal
   consultation and recs RE: prognosis & clinical outcomes
   - SW consult for family coping

Summary:

The patient is a 82-year-old male who presented with acute respiratory distress, PEA arrest, and was resuscitated. He has a history of CABG 7 years ago, ICD implantation 5 years ago, and chronic atrial fibrillation on coumadin. He is currently intubated and on pressors and cooling protocol. His current condition is characterized by:

* Bilateral basal ganglia hypodensity on Head CT, concerning for an anoxic brain injury
* Extensive sinus disease with multiple air-fluid levels
* Respiratory failure with high auto PEEP and PIP
* Cardiac arrest team involved, with unclear etiology
* Cooling protocol completed, now rewarmed
* Enrolled in steroid clinical trial
* Family meeting planned for this morning

Potential medical complications:

* Anoxic brain injury with potential for long-term neurocognitive impairment
* Respiratory failure with risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory acidosis
* Cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and potential for cardiac arrest
* Renal insufficiency with risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD)
* Metabolic acidosis with potential for lactic acidosis and electrolyte imbalances
* Potential for sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)

The patient's condition is unstable, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   coumadin, COPD presented with acute episode respiratory distress, PEA
   arrest s/p CPR/ACLS and now on pressors and cooling protocol.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial PEA
   arrest.  Wife states patient was 'not himself' the day prior.  No
   anticedent illness.  No e/o ischemia on EKG.  Anticoagulated so
   unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided pneumothorax (now s/p
   chest tube) with no e/o tension prior to arrival.  No e/o hypovolemia.
   With profound acidosis.  Thus, unclear but potentially primary cardiac
   vs pulmonary source.  Now s/p  cooling protocol - 18 hours cooling, 6
   hours warming

   .
   # Respiratory failure: s/p intubation initially difficult to ventilate
   with high auto PEEP, PIP.   Patient with h/o asthma and concern for
   bronchospasm on exam.  No h/o COPD per available records.  Improved
   with aggressive broncodilator therapy.
   - repeat CXR
   - RSBI 311
   - Schedule Albuterol / Ipratroprium  &  PRN Albuterol
   .
   # CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG (unknown anatomy). No localized ischemia
   on ECGs, cardiac enzymes elevated but s/p compressions, however cannot
   exclude ischemic event
   - enzymes trending down, will recheck as needed
 none for now
   - Repeat EKG this AM and another tomorrow AM
   .
   # PUMP: EF 25% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**2158-6-25**] ETT.
   - f/u TTE read
   .
   # RHYTHM: V-paced, pacer interrogated showing oversensitivity leading
   to 2 episodes of inappropriate ICD firing at OSH, none since. Patient
   therapeutic on prior coumadin.  Discontinued Amiodarone gtt upon
   arrival to CCU.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - history of chronic atrial fibrillation; now with changing rhythm on
   telemetry, some AVIR
   .
   #FEVER: Spiked 101.7 on [**7-31**] 1am. Pan-cultured. UA positive for LE, mod
   bacteria. On vanco/zosyn for broad coverage. Lines not grossly
   infected, CXR no e/o VAP.
   -          f/u blood and urine cx
   -          daily CXR
   .
   #NEURO: CT shows basal ganglia damage c/w ABI. Neuro following. Neuro
   exam shows some brainstem reflexes intact (pupils reactive, L corneal
   reflex).
   -          48 hr EEG complete at 10 this AM, f/u interpretation
   -          - f/u neuro rec
   .
   # s/p R chest tube for small R apical pneumothorax; now with some
   oozing.  Thoracics following.
   - CXR with side port in chest wall, fine by Thoracics unless develops
   airleak
   - repeat CXR; obtain daily CXR
   - follow chest tube output
   - monitor Hct as chest tube output bloody
   .
   # Asthma: Patient with reported h/o asthma, bronchospastic on exam.
   - aggressive standing neb treatment
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Baseline 1.2.  Likely some component of ATN
   given s/p PEA arrest x 2.  UOP poor.
   - Monitor uop / Cr
   .
   # Respiratory Acidosis / Metabolic Acidosis: Patient with mixed acid
   [**Last Name 3300**] problem.  Lactic acidosis.  Also with h/o COPD.
   - Ventilator management with increased Vt
   - Will move ETT down 3cm and repeat CXR afterwards
   - Adjust mech vent settings (? Increase TV) to compensate for
   respiratory acidosis

   VAP:  HOB, Chlorhexidate
   Communication:  Plan to have family meeting this morning
   Code status:  DNR (patient intubated)
   Disposition: CCU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest and is currently on pressors and cooling protocol. The patient has a history of CABG 7 years ago, s/p ICD 5 years ago, and has chronic atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 650 mL. The patient has a history of asthma and bronchospastic on exam, and is being treated with aggressive bronchodilator therapy.
* Cardiac status: The patient has a history of CAD and s/p CABG, and has elevated cardiac enzymes. The patient's ejection fraction is 25%, and the patient is being treated with anticoagulation therapy.
* Neurological status: The patient has a CT scan showing basal ganglia damage consistent with anoxic brain injury. The patient's neuro exam shows some brainstem reflexes intact, but the patient is non-responsive to verbal stimuli or sternal rub.
* Renal status: The patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.2, and is likely to have some component of acute tubular necrosis given the patient's s/p PEA arrest.
* Fever: The patient's temperature spiked to 101.7°F this afternoon, and the patient is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and the patient's respiratory status can deteriorate further.
* Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and s/p CABG, and the patient's ejection fraction is 25%. The patient is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
* Neurological complications: The patient has a CT scan showing basal ganglia damage consistent with anoxic brain injury, and the patient's neuro exam shows some brainstem reflexes intact. The patient is at risk for further neurological deterioration.
* Renal complications: The patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.2, and is likely to have some component of acute tubular necrosis given the patient's s/p PEA arrest. The patient is at risk for further renal deterioration.
* Sepsis: The patient's temperature spiked to 101.7°F this afternoon, and the patient is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient is at risk for developing sepsis or septic shock.

The patient's current medications include:

* Dopamine and norepinephrine infusions for pressor support
* Vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage
* Pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Fentanyl and midazolam for pain and sedation
* Albuterol and ipratropium for bronchodilator therapy

The patient's current laboratory results include:

* Hemoglobin: 11.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 153 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 15.5 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.1 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 3.1 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 5.0 mg/dL
* Albumin: 3.1 g/dL

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Weaning down on pressors and adjusting mechanical ventilation settings to compensate for respiratory acidosis
* Monitoring the patient's neurological status and adjusting therapy as needed
* Monitoring the patient's renal function and adjusting therapy as needed
* Monitoring the patient's temperature and adjusting therapy as needed
* Scheduling a family meeting to discuss the patient's condition and treatment plan."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   7/6/009
   - Neuro recs: EEG improved but still ""doing poorly."" Will reassess
   tomorrow. Will continue to recheck. If worsens, consider Midazolam
   levels. If [**Last Name (LF) 7542**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] check SPECT blood flow study to confirm.
   - TTE: Suboptimal [**2-26**] vent. Read pending
   - Head CT: Bilateral basal ganglia hypodensity, specifically involving
   the lentiform nuclei and caudate nuclei that in the current mechanism
   of PEA arrest, is highly concerning for an anoxic brain injury.
   Recommend MR for further evaluation as clinically feasible.
   2. Extensive sinus disease involving all of the paranasal sinuses, with
   multiple air-fluid levels seen within the maxillary and ventilate
   sinuses.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   7/6/009
   - Neuro recs: EEG improved but still ""doing poorly."" Will reassess
   tomorrow. Will continue to recheck. If worsens, consider Midazolam
   levels. If [**Last Name (LF) 7542**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] check SPECT blood flow study to confirm.
   - TTE: Suboptimal [**2-26**] vent. Read pending
   - Head CT: Bilateral basal ganglia hypodensity, specifically involving
   the lentiform nuclei and caudate nuclei that in the current mechanism
   of PEA arrest, is highly concerning for an anoxic brain injury.
   Recommend MR for further evaluation as clinically feasible.
   2. Extensive sinus disease involving all of the paranasal sinuses, with
   multiple air-fluid levels seen within the maxillary and ventilate
   sinuses.
   - Incr TV, CVP 8-9
   - BP dropping slightly (MAP 80s --> 70s), requiring incr pressors

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male who presented with acute respiratory distress, PEA arrest, and subsequent CPR/ACLS. He has a history of CABG 7 years ago, ICD implantation 5 years ago, and chronic atrial fibrillation on coumadin. He is currently on pressors and a cooling protocol. The patient has a mixed acid-base disorder with respiratory acidosis and metabolic acidosis, likely due to PEA arrest and COPD. He has a baseline creatinine of 1.2 and is likely experiencing some component of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) given his PEA arrest history.

The patient's neuro status is concerning, with a CT scan showing basal ganglia damage consistent with anoxic brain injury. His EEG is still ""doing poorly"" and will be reassessed tomorrow. He has some brainstem reflexes intact, but his neuro exam shows extensor posturing and minimal internal rotation to nailbed pressure.

The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, with a repeat CXR showing no pneumothorax and a RSBI of 311. He is on ventilator support with a CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode, and his PIP and plateau pressures are elevated.

The patient's laboratory results are notable for elevated cardiac enzymes, likely due to compressions, and a troponin-T level of 0.56. His WBC count is 15.5, and his platelet count is 153. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Plan:

* Continue to monitor the patient's neuro status and adjust therapy as necessary.
* Wean down on pressors, starting with dopamine, and keep the mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.
* Schedule a family meeting this morning.
* Repeat CXR and adjust ventilator settings as necessary.
* Monitor the patient's uop and Cr levels.
* Consider repeating the EEG and adjusting therapy based on the results.
* Continue to monitor the patient's temperature and adjust therapy as necessary.
* Consider enrolling the patient in a steroid clinical trial.
* Continue to provide aggressive bronchodilator therapy and monitor the patient's respiratory status.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections due to prolonged intubation and immobility.
* Sepsis or septic shock due to PEA arrest and prolonged hospitalization.
* Renal failure or worsening of ATN due to PEA arrest and prolonged hospitalization.
* Neurological complications, such as cerebral edema or further deterioration of brain function, due to anoxic brain injury.
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or further cardiac injury, due to PEA arrest and prolonged hospitalization.
* Respiratory failure or worsening of respiratory acidosis due to PEA arrest and prolonged hospitalization."
