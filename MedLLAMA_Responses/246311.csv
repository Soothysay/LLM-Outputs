   CT Abd and Pelvis:
   1. Severe pancreatitis with peripancreatic stranding and fluid, but no
   pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst. Reactive inflammation in the
   descending colon.
   2. Small blush along the course of a mesenteric vessel may represent a
   tiny
   pseudoaneurysm at the inferior margins of the inflammatory change.
   However this is not along the course of the dominant abdominal aortic
   vessels.
   3. Multiple renal hypodensities, most of which represent cysts, but the
   smallest of which cannot be fully characterized.
   Assessment and Plan
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
   74yoM h/o HIV on HAART and EtOH abuse transfered from OSH with
   pancreatitis and altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Pancreatitis - Severe pancreatitis as demonstrated on CT with
   evidence of pseudocyst.  Etiology likely secondary to EtOH vs drug
   reaction, HAART therapy held at OSH.  Cholelithiasis unlikely given
   unremarkable RUQ u/s.  TG 253.  Lipase normalizing.
   - NPO
   - IVF
   - hold HAART meds
   - pain meds
   - consider low rate enteric feeding to avoid bacterial translocation,
   place post pyloric Dobhoff
   - CT Abd/Pelvis
   #.  Respiratory failure: Now intubated after having an ABG with pH 7.27
   due to CO2 retention.
   - Currently on assist control, will wean per protocol as tolerated.
   #.  Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial and h/o progressive
   decline for one year. Toxic-metabolic, especially given elevated Na.
   Also concern for EtOH withdrawal.  Could be neuroleptic malignant
   syndrome given altered mental status, low grade temp, some rigidity on
   exam, however no documented Haldol given.  Consider infectious source
   however negative workup so far at OSH (see below for futher
   discussion).  No evidence of hemorrhage or trauma on CT.  TSH normal.
   - re check CK
   - LP in am after reversal of INR
   - CT head
   #.  Leukocytosis -  Low grade fever, was on Zosyn at OSH. Opacity on
   CXR however CT suggests attelectasis.  Concern for infection vs
   pancreatitis.
   - Pan culture if febrile
   - UA
   - Hold Abx until clear source.
   .
   #.  Hypernatremia - Sodium elevated to 161 at OSH from admission Na of
   134.  Today value is 153, with a free water deficit of 4.7 liters.
   More likely a chonically rising elevation in Na, as it is unlikely that
   with aggressive fluid resuscitation with NS, there was a 30 pt increase
   in one day.
   - Getting D5 1/2 NS at 600ccs/hour.
   - Check [**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   - Do not rapidly correct > 12mEq/24hr
   .
   #.  EtOH Withdrawal - H/o daily EtOH has been receiving BZD, approx
   4-8mg in 24hrs.  Unknown if prior seizures or withdrawal.  H/o chornic
   decline.  Now with tachycardia and hypertension as evidence of
   withrawal, no apparant tremors.  Is now 5 days from initial
   hospitalization.  Would expect that if he has had withdrawal, it would
   be improving at this point in his course.
   - CIWA protocol with frequent monitoring and ativan prn
   - thaimine
   .
   #.  HIV - Diagnosed in [**2124**] and long-term HAART therapy, currently held
   given concern for pancreatitis.
   - Hold HAART temporarily
   - ID consult
   .
   #.  Coagulopathy - INR elevated to 5.4 at OSH on warfarin for a fib.
   Warfarin held and Vit K started.  No obvious bleeding.
   - Recheck coags
   - Hold Warfarin
   - Continue Vit K
   - FFP if active bleeding
   .
   #.  A fib - On Warfarin, currently held in the setting of
   subratherapeutic INR.  Episode of RVR that responded to IV dig and
   lopressor at OSH.  Currently on scheduled lopressor.
   - Continue IV Lopressor
   - Hold dig as it was newly started and monitory for effect of beta
   blocker
   - Follow INR
   - Hold warfarin
   .
   #.  Ileus - CT with evidence of ileus, here with abdominal distention.
   Likely [**12-28**] pancreatitis.
   - NPO
   - bowel rest
   .
   #.  FEN: NPO
   - lytes [**Hospital1 7**], repleate as needed
   - nutrition c/s for TPN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV, HAART therapy, and ethanol (EtOH) abuse, who was transferred to the ICU with pancreatitis, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. He was intubated due to CO2 retention and is currently on assist control ventilation. He has a severe electrolyte and fluid disorder, with hypernatremia, and is at risk for EtOH withdrawal. He also has a history of chronic decline, and his mental status is likely multifactorial. He has a coagulopathy with an elevated INR, and is on warfarin for a fib. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, and is currently on IV dig and lopressor. He has ileus, and is NPO with bowel rest. He has a PICC line, arterial line, and is receiving IV fluids and medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is severe, and he is at risk for further complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocyst, and sepsis.
2. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's hypernatremia is a significant concern, and he is at risk for further electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. EtOH Withdrawal: The patient's history of EtOH abuse and current tachycardia and hypertension suggest that he may be experiencing withdrawal. He is at risk for seizures, hallucinations, and other complications.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and history of warfarin therapy put him at risk for bleeding complications.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and he is at risk for further complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and respiratory acidosis.
6. Ileus: The patient's ileus is a concern, and he is at risk for further complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, and sepsis.
7. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is a concern, and he is at risk for further complications such as stroke, heart failure, and thromboembolism.
8. HIV: The patient's HIV infection is a significant concern, and he is at risk for further complications such as opportunistic infections, malignancies, and immunodeficiency.
9. Infection: The patient's low-grade fever and opacity on CXR suggest that he may have an underlying infection. He is at risk for further complications such as sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis.
10. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and history of chronic decline suggest that he may be at risk for further neurological complications such as seizures, coma, and death."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   #.  Pancreatitis - Severe pancreatitis as demonstrated on CT with
   evidence of pseudocyst.  Etiology likely secondary to EtOH vs drug
   reaction, HAART therapy held at OSH.  Cholelithiasis unlikely given
   unremarkable RUQ u/s.  TG 253.  Lipase normalizing.

   - Currently on assist control with failure to fully correct his
   acidemia.  Will begin with increasing RR to improve ventilation.  If
   that does not work could consider increasing tidal volumes.
   #.  Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial and h/o progressive
   decline for one year. CT scan showed moderate ventriculomegaly,
   out-of-proportion to sulcal enlargement, concerning for communicating
   hydrocephalus or a chronic process. TSH normal.
   - re check CK
   - Now that INR normalized, can do an LP.  Will be good for CSF analysis
   and measurement of pressures.
   #.  Leukocytosis -  No clear source to date, not on antibiotics.
   Opacity on CXR however CT suggests atelectasis.  UA negative. Concern
   for infection vs pancreatitis.
   - Pan culture if febrile
   - Hold Abx until clear source.

   #.  Hypernatremia - Sodium elevated to 161 at OSH from admission Na of
   134.  Today value is 153, with a free water deficit of 4.7 liters.
   More likely a chonically rising elevation in Na, as it is unlikely that
   with aggressive fluid resuscitation with NS, there was a 30 pt increase
   in one day.   Today he appears euvolemic, so we will give just free
   water to try to correct hypernatremia.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV on HAART therapy and ethanol abuse, who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital with pancreatitis and altered mental status. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. His laboratory results show severe pancreatitis with evidence of pseudocyst, hypernatremia, and leukocytosis. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation, delirium, and chronic decline.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is severe and may lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocyst, or sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to complications such as seizures, coma, and death if not properly managed.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of infection or pancreatitis, which may worsen if not properly managed.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may lead to bleeding complications if not properly managed.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to complications such as stroke, heart failure, and cardiac arrest if not properly managed.
7. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen if not properly managed, leading to increased risk of falls, pressure ulcers, and other complications.
8. Ileus: The patient's ileus may lead to complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, and sepsis if not properly managed.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires close monitoring and management of his pancreatitis, respiratory failure, hypernatremia, leukocytosis, coagulopathy, atrial fibrillation, delirium, and ileus. He should receive aggressive fluid resuscitation with D5W to correct his hypernatremia, and his respiratory failure should be managed with mechanical ventilation and optimization of his oxygenation and ventilation. His pancreatitis should be managed with pain management and bowel rest, and his coagulopathy should be managed with vitamin K and warfarin. His atrial fibrillation should be managed with beta blockers and anticoagulation therapy, and his delirium should be managed with sedation and delirium protocols. His ileus should be managed with bowel rest and decompression with a nasogastric tube."

   #.  Pancreatitis - Severe pancreatitis as demonstrated on CT with
   evidence of pseudocyst.  Etiology likely secondary to EtOH vs drug
   reaction, HAART therapy held at OSH.  Cholelithiasis unlikely given
   unremarkable RUQ u/s.  TG 253.  Lipase normalizing.

   #.  Respiratory failure: Now intubated after having an ABG with pH 7.27
   due to CO2 retention.
   - Currently on assist control, will wean per protocol as tolerated.
   #.  Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial and h/o progressive
   decline for one year. Toxic-metabolic, especially given elevated Na.
   Also concern for EtOH withdrawal.  Could be neuroleptic malignant
   syndrome given altered mental status, low grade temp, some rigidity on
   exam, however no documented Haldol given.  Consider infectious source
   however negative workup so far at OSH (see below for futher
   discussion).  No evidence of hemorrhage or trauma on CT.  TSH normal.
   - re check CK
   - LP in am after reversal of INR

   #.  Leukocytosis -  Low grade fever, was on Zosyn at OSH. Opacity on
   CXR however CT suggests attelectasis.  Concern for infection vs
   pancreatitis.
   - Pan culture if febrile
   - UA
   - Hold Abx until clear source.

   #.  Hypernatremia - Sodium elevated to 161 at OSH from admission Na of
   134.  Today value is 153, with a free water deficit of 4.7 liters.
   More likely a chonically rising elevation in Na, as it is unlikely that
   with aggressive fluid resuscitation with NS, there was a 30 pt increase
   in one day.
   - Getting D5 1/2 NS at 600ccs/hour.

   #.  EtOH Withdrawal - H/o daily EtOH has been receiving BZD, approx
   4-8mg in 24hrs.  Unknown if prior seizures or withdrawal.  H/o chornic
   decline.  Now with tachycardia and hypertension as evidence of
   withrawal, no apparant tremors.  Is now 5 days from initial

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV on HAART and EtOH abuse, who was transferred from another hospital with pancreatitis and altered mental status. The patient's condition is complex and multifaceted, with several potential medical complications.

1. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe pancreatitis with evidence of pseudocyst on CT scan, likely secondary to EtOH abuse or drug reaction. The patient's lipase levels are normalizing, but the patient is at risk for complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocyst, and infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure, with an ABG showing pH 7.27 due to CO2 retention. The patient's respiratory status is being managed with assist control ventilation, with plans to wean the patient off the ventilator as tolerated.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, with potential causes including toxic-metabolic, EtOH withdrawal, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The patient's mental status is being monitored, and the patient is at risk for further decline if not properly managed.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has a leukocytosis of 18.5 K/uL, with a low-grade fever and opacity on CXR. The patient is at risk for infection, and a pan culture is pending if the patient becomes febrile.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has a sodium level of 153 mEq/L, with a free water deficit of 4.7 liters. The patient's electrolyte levels are being monitored, and the patient is at risk for further electrolyte imbalances if not properly managed.
6. EtOH withdrawal: The patient has a history of daily EtOH use and is at risk for EtOH withdrawal. The patient's CIWA protocol is being followed, with frequent monitoring and ativan prn as needed.
7. HIV: The patient is diagnosed with HIV and is on long-term HAART therapy, which is currently held due to concern for pancreatitis. An ID consult is pending to determine the best course of treatment.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR of 5.4, likely due to warfarin therapy. The patient's coagulation status is being monitored, and the patient is at risk for bleeding if not properly managed.
9. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is being managed with scheduled lopressor. The patient's INR is being monitored, and the patient is at risk for further arrhythmias if not properly managed.

In summary, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including pancreatitis, respiratory failure, altered mental status, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, EtOH withdrawal, HIV, coagulopathy, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with severe pancreatitis, fluid and stranding in the colon, and ventriculomegaly on CT head with central atrophy or communicating hydrocephalus. The patient was started on invasive ventilation, arterial line, and aggressive fluids. He was afebrile throughout the day, but continued to have tachycardia and hypotension, which was treated with 2L NS boluses. The patient's labs showed Na 156, K 3.2, BUN/Cr 25/1.2, BS 204, and free Ca 1.23 nml. The patient's WBC count decreased from 16 to 14, and his INR decreased from 4.8 to 1.5. The patient is pending B12 and folate levels, and has UNa 19 and Uosm 636.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on invasive ventilation and has a high risk of developing respiratory failure due to severe pancreatitis and potential lung injury.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has atrial flutter and may be at risk of developing other cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances and pancreatitis.
3. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing infection due to pancreatitis and invasive lines, which may lead to sepsis and organ failure.
4. Fluid overload: The patient is receiving aggressive fluids and may be at risk of developing fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and cardiovascular instability.
5. Pancreatic necrosis: The patient has severe pancreatitis, but does not have pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst on CT scan. However, there is a small blush along the course of a mesenteric vessel that may represent a tiny pseudoaneurysm, which may increase the risk of pancreatic necrosis.
6. Renal failure: The patient has multiple renal hypodensities, most of which represent cysts, but the smallest of which cannot be fully characterized. This may increase the risk of renal failure.
7. Delirium and confusion: The patient has delirium and confusion, which may be due to pancreatitis, electrolyte imbalances, or other underlying medical conditions.
8. Central nervous system complications: The patient has ventriculomegaly on CT head with central atrophy or communicating hydrocephalus, which may increase the risk of central nervous system complications such as brain edema, herniation, or stroke.

Based on the patient's condition, it is recommended to continue aggressive fluid management, monitor for signs of respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and infection, and consider consulting with pancreas, ID, and TPN specialists. The patient's electrolyte and fluid disorders should be closely monitored, and adjustments made as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of HIV, on antiretroviral therapy, admitted to the ICU with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and electrolyte and fluid disorders. He underwent a lumbar puncture (LP) which showed normal CSF findings. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600cc and has a persistent acidosis. His temperature has increased to 100.4°F, likely due to pancreatitis. His blood cultures are pending, and he has a small left effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration, potentially leading to ARDS or respiratory arrest.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is severe, and there is a risk of pancreatic necrosis, pseudocyst formation, or infected pancreatic fluid collection.
3. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorders: The patient's electrolyte and fluid disorders are ongoing, and there is a risk of further imbalance, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or seizures.
4. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's delirium and confusion may be related to his underlying illness, medications, or electrolyte imbalances, and there is a risk of worsening cognitive function or development of psychosis.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or stroke.
6. Infection: The patient's blood cultures are pending, and there is a risk of developing a secondary infection, potentially leading to sepsis or septic shock.
7. VAP: The patient is at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), potentially leading to respiratory failure or sepsis.
8. DVT: The patient is at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT), potentially leading to pulmonary embolism or post-thrombotic syndrome.
9. Stress Ulcer: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis may be inadequate, potentially leading to gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor his respiratory, cardiovascular, and electrolyte status, as well as his mental status, and to adjust his treatment plan accordingly."

   .
   #.  Pancreatitis - Severe pancreatitis as demonstrated on CT with
   evidence of pseudocyst.  Etiology likely secondary to EtOH vs drug
   reaction, HAART therapy held at OSH.  Cholelithiasis unlikely given
   unremarkable RUQ u/s.  TG 253.  Lipase normalizing.
   - NPO
   - IVF with D5W for correction of hypernatremia as he now appears
   euvolemic.
   - hold HAART meds
   - pain meds
   - Consult IR to have post-pyloric dobhoff placed to give low amounts of
   - Consult Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2269**] from Pancreatic service
   #.  Respiratory failure: Now intubated after having an ABG with pH 7.27
   due to CO2 retention.
   - Currently on assist control with failure to fully correct his
   acidemia.  Will begin with increasing RR to improve ventilation.  If
   that does not work could consider increasing tidal volumes.
   #.  Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial and h/o progressive
   decline for one year. CT scan showed moderate ventriculomegaly,
   out-of-proportion to sulcal enlargement, concerning for communicating
   hydrocephalus or a chronic process. TSH normal.
   - re check CK
   - Now that INR normalized, can do an LP.  Will be good for CSF analysis
   and measurement of pressures.
   #.  Leukocytosis -  No clear source to date, not on antibiotics.
   Opacity on CXR however CT suggests atelectasis.  UA negative. Concern
   for infection vs pancreatitis.
   - Pan culture if febrile
   - Hold Abx until clear source.
   .
   #.  Hypernatremia - Sodium elevated to 161 at OSH from admission Na of
   134.  Today value is 153, with a free water deficit of 4.7 liters.
   More likely a chonically rising elevation in Na, as it is unlikely that
   with aggressive fluid resuscitation with NS, there was a 30 pt increase
   in one day.   Today he appears euvolemic, so we will give just free
   water to try to correct hypernatremia.
   - Will give D5W at 150ccs/hour.
   - Check [**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   - Do not rapidly correct > 12mEq/24hr

   #.  EtOH Withdrawal - H/o daily EtOH and prior to intubation had been
   receiving BZD, approx 4-8mg in 24hrs.  Unknown if prior seizures or
   withdrawal.  H/o chornic decline.  We can reassess after his mental
   status improves, as he is currently intubated and sedated.

   - Hold HAART temporarily.  We will try to contact his outpatient
   provider to gather added information.
   - ID consult
   .
   #.  Coagulopathy - INR elevated to 5.4 at OSH on warfarin for a fib.
   Warfarin held and Vit K started, his INR is now normalized.  No obvious
   bleeding.  Once he has been stabilized, we will consider restarting his
   warfarin.
   .
   #.  A fib - On Warfarin, currently held in the setting of
   subratherapeutic INR.  Episode of RVR that responded to IV dig and
   lopressor at OSH.  Currently on a labetalol gtt and well controlled.
   - Hold dig as it was newly started and monitor for effect of beta
   blocker
   - Follow INR
   - Hold warfarin

   #.  Ileus
 Has had CT with evidence of ileus and abdominal distention
   on exam.  Likely [**12-28**] pancreatitis.  [**Month (only) 51**] improve with dobhoff for
   decompression.  We will continue to monitor.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV on HAART therapy and EtOH abuse, was transferred to the ICU from the operating room (OSH) with pancreatitis and altered mental status. He has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 100.4°F, heart rate of 102 bpm, and blood pressure of 99/55 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Leukocytosis with a WBC count of 17.2 K/uL
* Hypernatremia with a sodium level of 153 mEq/L
* Elevated lipase levels (152 IU/L)
* Abnormal liver function tests (ALT/AST: 28/37 IU/L)
* Elevated LDH levels (331 IU/L)
* Abnormal kidney function tests (Cr: 0.9 mg/dL, TCO2: 23 mmol/L)

Imaging studies show:

* Severe pancreatitis with peripancreatic stranding and fluid, but no pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst
* Small blush along the course of a mesenteric vessel, which may represent a tiny pseudoaneurysm
* Multiple renal hypodensities, most of which represent cysts

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to inadequate ventilation or infection
* Electrolyte and fluid disorder, including hypernatremia and fluid overload
* Atrial fibrillation, which may increase the risk of stroke or cardiac arrhythmias
* Delirium or confusion, which may be due to sepsis, hypoxia, or medication
* Pancreatitis, which may lead to organ failure or sepsis
* HIV-related complications, including opportunistic infections or immune reconstitution syndrome
* Coagulopathy, which may increase the risk of bleeding or thrombosis
* EtOH withdrawal syndrome, which may lead to seizures or delirium

The patient's management plan includes:

* NPO status with IV fluids and electrolyte replacement
* Hold HAART therapy temporarily and consult with the ID team
* Consult with the IR team for placement of a post-pyloric tube for decompression
* Continue mechanical ventilation and adjust settings as needed
* Monitor for signs of infection, including fever, leukocytosis, and changes in mental status
* Monitor for signs of coagulopathy, including bleeding or thrombosis
* Consider restarting warfarin once the patient's coagulopathy has resolved

The patient's code status is DNR, and he has expressed a desire for a dignified death without prolonged mechanical ventilation."

   - F/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2269**] from Pancreas
   #.  Respiratory failure: Now intubated after having an ABG with pH 7.27
   due to CO2 retention.  Continued to be acidotic at 7.3 so tidal volume
   increased to 760 and CO2 slightly improved to 42 this am, pH 7.31.
   - Increase tidal volume to 800 this am to improve ventilation and
   repeat ABG later this am
   #.  Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial and h/o progressive
   decline for one year. CT scan showed moderate ventriculomegaly,
   out-of-proportion to sulcal enlargement, concerning for communicating
   hydrocephalus or a chronic process. TSH normal.
   - re check CK

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV on HAART therapy and ethanol abuse, admitted to the ICU with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. He has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. His condition is complicated by electrolyte and fluid disorders, atrial fibrillation, delirium, and possible infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is severe and may lead to further complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocyst formation, or abscesses.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory acidosis, hypercapnia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorders: The patient's electrolyte and fluid disorders may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or seizures.
4. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen if not treated promptly.
5. HIV-related Complications: The patient's HIV infection may lead to further complications such as opportunistic infections, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), or antiretroviral therapy (ART) side effects.
6. EtOH Withdrawal: The patient's ethanol withdrawal may lead to seizures, hallucinations, or other withdrawal symptoms if not managed properly.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to further complications such as central nervous system damage, seizures, or coma if not managed properly.
8. Ileus: The patient's ileus may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or sepsis.
9. DVT and Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's DVT prophylaxis may not be sufficient, and he may be at risk for pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.
10. Code Status: The patient's code status is DNR, but he has expressed a desire for a dignified death and does not want prolonged mechanical ventilation."

   IMPRESSION:
   1. Severe pancreatitis with peripancreatic stranding and fluid, but no
   pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst. Reactive inflammation in the
   descending
   colon.
   2. Small blush along the course of a mesenteric vessel may represent a
   tiny
   pseudoaneurysm at the inferior margins of the inflammatory change.
   However
   this is not along the course of the dominant abdominal aortic vessels.
   3. Multiple renal hypodensities, most of which represent cysts, but the

 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
   74yoM h/o HIV on HAART and EtOH abuse transfered from OSH with
   pancreatitis and altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Pancreatitis - Severe pancreatitis as demonstrated on CT with
   evidence of pseudocyst.  Etiology likely secondary to EtOH vs drug
   reaction, HAART therapy held at OSH.  Cholelithiasis unlikely given
   unremarkable RUQ u/s.  Lipase normalizing.
   [**Last Name (un) 1369**]
s criteria significant for age, WBC
s and LDH on presentation
   and Hct drop, base deficit, and fluid sequestration at 48hrs. With
   these six criteria, has 40% chance mortality.
   - NPO
   - Will give 1L D5 bicarb bolus and then maintenance with D5W
   - hold HAART meds
   - pain meds with Fentanyl
   - Will need jejunal Dobhoff placed
   - F/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2269**] from Pancreas
   #.  Respiratory failure: Now intubated after having an ABG with pH 7.27
   due to CO2 retention.  Continued to be acidotic at 7.3 so tidal volume
   increased to 760 and CO2 slightly improved to 42 this am, pH 7.31.
   #.  Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial and h/o progressive
   decline for one year. CT scan showed moderate ventriculomegaly,
   out-of-proportion to sulcal enlargement, concerning for communicating
   hydrocephalus or a chronic process. TSH normal.
   - re check CK
   --F/u Crypto and HSV from PCR
   --Continue sedation with Fentanyl Versed for now until less acidotic
   and underlying medical condition appears to improve, then will consider
   decreasing sedation
   #.  Leukocytosis -  No clear source to date, not on antibiotics.
   Opacity on CXR however CT suggests atelectasis.  UA negative. Concern
   for infection vs pancreatitis.
   - Pan culture if febrile
 cultures negative to date
   - Continue to hold Abx until clear source
   - Pull PICC line from OSH and will need to have central line placed
   today
   .
   #.  Hypernatremia
 Had hypovolemic hypernatremia picture on
   presentation with elevated Uosm and low UNa. Sodium improving slowly,
   is 147 today. Wt is 84kg with free H20 deficit 2.5L. Appears euvolemic
   now.
   - Will give D5W at 150ccs/hour.
   - Check [**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   - Do not rapidly correct > 12mEq/24hr
   .
   #.  EtOH Withdrawal - H/o daily EtOH and prior to intubation had been
   receiving BZD, approx 4-8mg in 24hrs.  Unknown if prior seizures or
   withdrawal.  H/o chronic decline.  We can reassess after his mental
   status improves, as he is currently intubated and sedated.
   - thiamine, multivitamins, folate qday
   - continue sedation Versed as is for now
   .
   #.  HIV - Diagnosed in [**2124**] and long-term HAART therapy, currently held
   given concern for pancreatitis.
   - Currently holding HAART. Was taking Combivir/Sustiva before
   admission. Will consult ID about the need to start his therapy, given
   that it could have been implicated in the pancreatitis
   #.  A fib - On Warfarin, currently held in the setting of
   subratherapeutic INR, but his coagulopathy has now normalized.
   .  Episode of RVR that responded to IV dig and lopressor at OSH.
   Currently on a labetalol gtt and well controlled.
   - Will consider adding back Coumadin now that subTx INR, but unclear
   whether necessary in setting of acute illness with increased risk of
   bleed with higher INR
   - Hold dig as it was newly started and monitor for effect of beta
   blocker
   - Follow INR
   - Hold warfarin
   .
   #.  Ileus
 Has had CT with evidence of ileus and abdominal distention
   on exam.  Likely due to pancreatitis.  [**Month (only) 51**] improve with dobhoff for
   decompression.  We will continue to monitor.
   - Place Dobhoff into jejunum and will start light TF
   #.  FEN: NPO
   - lytes [**Hospital1 7**], replete as needed
   - can begin low-dose tube-feeds after dobhoff placement today
   .
   #.  PPX:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots and SC heparin.
   -Bowel regimen not needed currently.
   -Pain management with fentanyl.
   .
   #.  ACCESS: PIV's, PICC -> plan is to leave outside PICC for now. Art
   line on R
   .
   #.  CODE STATUS: Per report, DNR, ok to intubate but he has said he
   would like a
dignified death
 and does not want prolonged mechanical
   ventilation.  Will clarify with his son.
   .
   #.  EMERGENCY CONTACT: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 107**] [**Known lastname 11148**] healthcare proxy (son, lives in

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV on HAART therapy and EtOH abuse, who was transferred from another hospital with pancreatitis and altered mental status. The patient is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

The patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and has a pH of 7.31, indicating ongoing acidosis. The tidal volume has been increased to 760 mL, and the CO2 level has improved to 42 mmHg.
2. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has hypernatremia, with a sodium level of 147 mmol/L, and is receiving D5W at 150 mL/hour.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe pancreatitis with peripancreatic stranding and fluid, but no pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst. The etiology is likely secondary to EtOH or drug reaction.
4. Altered mental status: The patient has a history of progressive decline over the past year, and the CT scan shows moderate ventriculomegaly, out-of-proportion to sulcal enlargement, concerning for communicating hydrocephalus or a chronic process.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has a white blood cell count of 17.2 x 10^9/L, with no clear source identified.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient has a sodium level of 147 mmol/L, with a free water deficit of 2.5 L.
7. EtOH withdrawal: The patient has a history of daily EtOH consumption and was receiving benzodiazepines prior to intubation.
8. HIV: The patient is diagnosed with HIV and was taking Combivir/Sustiva prior to admission. HAART therapy is currently being held due to concern for pancreatitis.
9. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation on Warfarin, which is currently being held due to subtherapeutic INR.
10. Ileus: The patient has evidence of ileus on CT scan and abdominal distension on exam, likely due to pancreatitis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Respiratory support: The patient will continue to receive mechanical ventilation and sedation with fentanyl and midazolam.
2. Electrolyte and fluid management: The patient will receive D5W at 150 mL/hour and will be monitored for electrolyte imbalances.
3. Pancreatitis management: The patient will continue to receive analgesics and will have a jejunostomy tube placed for decompression.
4. Infection control: The patient will have cultures taken and will receive antibiotics if febrile or if an infection is suspected.
5. HIV management: The patient's HAART therapy will be reevaluated, and consideration will be given to restarting therapy once the pancreatitis has resolved.
6. EtOH withdrawal management: The patient will continue to receive benzodiazepines and will be monitored for signs of withdrawal.
7. Pain management: The patient will continue to receive analgesics as needed.
8. DVT prophylaxis: The patient will receive prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin and compression stockings.

The patient's code status is DNR, and the family has been informed that the patient does not want prolonged mechanical ventilation. The patient's healthcare proxy is his son, who has been informed of the patient's condition and treatment plan."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   trend has been downwards since admission and is overall 17L positive.
   #.  Respiratory failure: ABG has improved, is less CO2 and pH is better
   yesterday after giving more fluids, so could have been intravascular
   volume down leading to significant amt of dead space. Will continue to
   try to keep up with his volume status today with normal saline.
   - SBT and try to wean from vent
   #.  Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial and h/o progressive
   decline for one year. CT scan showed moderate ventriculomegaly,
   out-of-proportion to sulcal enlargement, concerning for communicating
   hydrocephalus or a chronic process. TSH normal.

   #.  HIV - Diagnosed in [**2124**] and long-term HAART therapy, currently held
   given concern for pancreatitis.
   - Currently holding HAART. Was taking Combivir/Sustiva before
   admission. Will consult ID about the need to start his therapy, given
   that it could have been implicated in the pancreatitis
   #.  A fib - On Warfarin, currently held in the setting of
   subratherapeutic INR, but his coagulopathy has now normalized.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV, EtOH abuse, and pancreatitis. He was transferred to the ICU from the operating room (OSH) with severe pancreatitis, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. He has a high risk of mortality due to his age, WBC count, and LDH levels on presentation.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including the placement of a central line, Dobhoff tube, and arterial line. He is currently receiving fluid boluses, vasopressors, and sedation. His respiratory status has improved slightly, but he remains on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's mental status is still altered, and he is not responding to voice stimuli. His pupils are reactive, but he is not following commands. He has a history of progressive decline over the past year, and a CT scan revealed moderate ventriculomegaly, suggesting possible communicating hydrocephalus or a chronic process.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, hypernatremia, and leukocytosis, but the source of these abnormalities is unclear. He is also at risk for EtOH withdrawal, and his HIV medication has been held due to concerns about pancreatitis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is severe, and he is at risk for further complications, such as pseudocyst formation, abscesses, or hemorrhage.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still precarious, and he is at risk for further deterioration, such as pneumonia or respiratory arrest.
3. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated LDH levels suggest possible sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
4. EtOH withdrawal: The patient is at risk for EtOH withdrawal, which could lead to seizures, delirium, or other complications.
5. HIV-related complications: The patient's HIV infection could lead to opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis pneumonia or Tuberculosis.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia could lead to dehydration, seizures, or other complications if not properly managed.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis could be a sign of infection, which could lead to further complications if not properly treated.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia could lead to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, which could exacerbate his respiratory and cardiovascular status.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for further complications and requires close monitoring and management to prevent or treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV, EtOH abuse, and chronic decline, who was transferred to the ICU with pancreatitis, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. He has a severe pancreatitis with evidence of pseudocyst, and his etiology is likely secondary to EtOH vs drug reaction. He has a 40% chance of mortality due to six criteria significant for age, WBC, and LDH on presentation, and Hct drop, base deficit, and fluid sequestration at 48 hours.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: He is on a ventilator with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and FiO2 of 40%. His ABG has improved, and he is less CO2 and pH is better.
* Altered mental status: He is intubated and sedated, with a likely multifactorial cause, including progressive decline, moderate ventriculomegaly, and chronic process.
* Leukocytosis: He has no clear source of infection, and cultures are negative to date.
* EtOH withdrawal: He is currently receiving benzodiazepines and multivitamins, and his mental status will be reassessed once he improves.
* HIV: He is diagnosed with HIV and has been on long-term HAART therapy, which was held due to concern for pancreatitis.
* A fib: He has atrial fibrillation and was on Warfarin, which was held due to subtherapeutic INR.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: With the patient's leukocytosis and negative cultures, there is a risk of sepsis developing, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Pancreatitis complications: The patient's pancreatitis can lead to complications such as pseudocyst rupture, abscess formation, and hemorrhage.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to ventilator-associated pneumonia, lung injury, and death.
4. EtOH withdrawal: The patient's EtOH withdrawal can lead to seizures, hallucinations, and cardiovascular instability.
5. HIV-related complications: The patient's HIV can lead to opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and Kaposi's sarcoma.
6. Atrial fibrillation complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation can lead to stroke, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.

The patient's family meeting is scheduled to discuss his goals of care, including his code status and potential for prolonged mechanical ventilation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is currently stable with a rate of 70-90 beats per minute. The patient is also receiving warfarin, but it has been held due to an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2.

The patient has a diagnosis of anemia, hypotension, respiratory failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, atrial fibrillation, delirium/confusion, and pancreatitis. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL and a hematocrit of 24.9%. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a sodium level of 140 mmol/L, potassium level of 112 mmol/L, and chloride level of 112 mmol/L.

The patient's imaging studies show a head computed tomography (CT) scan, but the results are not specified.

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing mechanical ventilation, administering medications as needed, and monitoring the patient's vital signs and laboratory results.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory acidosis, hypercapnia, and hypoxemia.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's electrolyte and fluid disorder may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and seizures.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may worsen, leading to sepsis, multi-organ failure, and death.
6. Delirium/confusion: The patient's delirium/confusion may worsen, leading to agitation, aggression, and decreased ability to follow medical instructions.
7. Infection: The patient may develop an infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which may worsen the patient's respiratory failure and overall condition.

Based on the provided information, it is recommended that the patient continue to receive close monitoring and treatment in the ICU, with regular assessments of their vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies. The patient's treatment plan should be adjusted as needed to address any complications that may arise."

   74yoM h/o HIV on HAART and EtOH abuse transfered from OSH with
   pancreatitis and altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Pancreatitis - Severe pancreatitis as demonstrated on CT with
   evidence of pseudocyst.  Etiology likely secondary to EtOH vs drug
   reaction, HAART therapy held at OSH.  Cholelithiasis unlikely given
   unremarkable RUQ u/s.  Lipase normalizing.
   [**Last Name (un) 1369**]
s criteria significant for age, WBC
s and LDH on presentation
   and Hct drop, base deficit, and fluid sequestration at 48hrs. With
   these six criteria, has 40% chance mortality.
   - Pt on schedule for IR guided placement of Dobhoff into jejunum, will
   then f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2269**] and start feedings per their recs.
   - NPO for now though
   - hold HAART meds
   - pain meds with Fentanyl
   - consider re-imaging his abdomen to see if any improvement in
   pancreatitis
   # Dropping hematocrit
 Unclear source as guiac
s negative per nursing
   and no clear blood loss anywhere.
   #.  Respiratory failure: ABG has improved, is less CO2 and pH is better
   yesterday after giving more fluids, so could have been intravascular
   volume down leading to significant amt of dead space. Will continue to
   try to keep up with his volume status today with normal saline.
   #.  Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial and h/o progressive
   decline for one year. CT scan showed moderate ventriculomegaly,
   out-of-proportion to sulcal enlargement, concerning for communicating
   hydrocephalus or a chronic process. TSH normal.
   - re check CK
   --F/u Crypto and HSV from PCR
   --Continue sedation with Fentanyl Versed for now until less acidotic
   and underlying medical condition appears to improve, then will consider
   decreasing sedation
   #.  Leukocytosis -  No clear source to date, not on antibiotics.
   Opacity on CXR however CT suggests atelectasis.  UA negative. Concern
   for infection vs pancreatitis.
   - Pan culture if febrile
 cultures negative to date
   - Continue to hold Abx until clear source
   - Pull PICC line from OSH and will need to have central line placed
   today
   .
   #.  Hypernatremia
 Had hypovolemic hypernatremia picture on
   presentation with elevated Uosm and low UNa. Sodium improving slowly,
   is 147 today. Wt is 84kg with free H20 deficit 2.5L. Appears euvolemic
   now.
   - Will give D5W at 150ccs/hour.
   - Check [**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   - Do not rapidly correct > 12mEq/24hr
   .
   #.  EtOH Withdrawal - H/o daily EtOH and prior to intubation had been
   receiving BZD, approx 4-8mg in 24hrs.  Unknown if prior seizures or
   withdrawal.  H/o chronic decline.  We can reassess after his mental
   status improves, as he is currently intubated and sedated.
   - thiamine, multivitamins, folate qday
   - continue sedation Versed as is for now
   .
   #.  HIV - Diagnosed in [**2124**] and long-term HAART therapy, currently held
   given concern for pancreatitis.
   - Currently holding HAART. Was taking Combivir/Sustiva before
   admission. Will consult ID about the need to start his therapy, given
   that it could have been implicated in the pancreatitis
   #.  A fib - On Warfarin, currently held in the setting of
   subratherapeutic INR, but his coagulopathy has now normalized.
   .  Episode of RVR that responded to IV dig and lopressor at OSH.
   Currently on a labetalol gtt and well controlled.
   - Will consider adding back Coumadin now that subTx INR, but unclear
   whether necessary in setting of acute illness with increased risk of
   bleed with higher INR
   - Hold dig as it was newly started and monitor for effect of beta
   blocker
   - Follow INR
   - Hold warfarin
   .
   #.  Ileus
 Has had CT with evidence of ileus and abdominal distention
   on exam.  Likely due to pancreatitis.  [**Month (only) 51**] improve with dobhoff for
   decompression.  We will continue to monitor.
   - Place Dobhoff into jejunum and will start light TF
   #.  FEN: NPO
   - lytes [**Hospital1 7**], replete as needed
   - can begin low-dose tube-feeds after dobhoff placement today
   .
   #.  PPX:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots and SC heparin.
   -Bowel regimen not needed currently.
   -Pain management with fentanyl.
   .
   #.  ACCESS: PIV's, PICC -> plan is to leave outside PICC for now. Art
   line on R
   .
   #.  CODE STATUS: Per report, DNR, ok to intubate but he has said he
   would like a
dignified death
 and does not want prolonged mechanical
   ventilation.  Will clarify with his son.
   .
   #.  EMERGENCY CONTACT: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 107**] [**Known lastname 11148**] healthcare proxy (son, lives in
   [**Name (NI) 11149**]) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11150**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   pancreatitis
   # Dropping hematocrit
 Unclear source as guiac
s negative per nursing
   and no clear blood loss anywhere.
   #.  Respiratory failure: ABG has improved, is less CO2 and pH is better
   yesterday after giving more fluids, so could have been intravascular
   volume down leading to significant amt of dead space. Will continue to
   try to keep up with his volume status today with normal saline.
   #.  Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial and h/o progressive
   decline for one year. CT scan showed moderate ventriculomegaly,
   out-of-proportion to sulcal enlargement, concerning for communicating
   hydrocephalus or a chronic process. TSH normal.
   - re check CK
   --F/u Crypto and HSV from PCR
   --Continue sedation with Fentanyl Versed for now until less acidotic
   and underlying medical condition appears to improve, then will consider
   decreasing sedation
   #.  Leukocytosis -  No clear source to date, not on antibiotics.
   Opacity on CXR however CT suggests atelectasis.  UA negative. Concern
   for infection vs pancreatitis.

   that it could have been implicated in the pancreatitis
   #.  A fib - On Warfarin, currently held in the setting of
   subratherapeutic INR, but his coagulopathy has now normalized.
   .  Episode of RVR that responded to IV dig and lopressor at OSH.
   Currently on a labetalol gtt and well controlled.
   - Will consider adding back Coumadin now that subTx INR, but unclear
   whether necessary in setting of acute illness with increased risk of
   bleed with higher INR

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV, EtOH abuse, and pancreatitis. The patient was transferred to the ICU from the operating room (OSH) with severe pancreatitis, altered mental status, and respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.3°C (101°F)
* Heart rate: 77 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 101/51 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 9 mmHg

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Anemia: Hematocrit (Hct) is dropping, and the patient has a history of HIV and EtOH abuse.
2. Hypotension: The patient has a blood pressure of 101/51 mmHg, which is below the normal range.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has a respiratory rate of 20 insp/min, and his ABG shows a pH of 7.42, which is within the normal range.
4. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has a sodium level of 140 mmol/L, which is within the normal range, but his chloride level is high at 112 mmol/L.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a heart rhythm of atrial fibrillation.
6. Delirium/confusion: The patient is not responsive to voice and has altered mental status.
7. Pancreatitis: The patient has a severe case of pancreatitis, which is likely secondary to EtOH abuse or drug reaction.
8. Leukocytosis: The patient has a white blood cell count of 18.4, which is above the normal range.
9. Hypernatremia: The patient has a sodium level of 147 mmol/L, which is above the normal range.

The patient is currently receiving the following medications:

* Midazolam (Versed) 1.5 mg/hour
* Norepinephrine 0.05 mcg/kg/min
* Fentanyl 125 mcg/hour
* Heparin sodium (prophylaxis)
* Thiamine, multivitamins, and folate qday

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Placement of a Dobhoff tube into the jejunum for decompression and feeding
* Continuous monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results
* Administration of pain medication as needed
* Re-evaluation of the patient's mental status and respiratory status
* Consideration of re-imaging the patient's abdomen to assess the severity of pancreatitis

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient has a high white blood cell count and is at risk for developing sepsis.
* Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and may require mechanical ventilation.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has atrial fibrillation and may be at risk for developing other cardiac arrhythmias.
* Pancreatitis: The patient has severe pancreatitis and may require further treatment, including antibiotics and surgical intervention.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has a high chloride level and may be at risk for developing other electrolyte imbalances.
* HIV-related complications: The patient has HIV and may be at risk for developing HIV-related complications, including opportunistic infections and cancer."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV, alcohol abuse, and pancreatitis. He was admitted to the ICU with acute pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. His condition is severe, with a 40% chance of mortality based on the Ranson criteria. He has a pseudocyst on CT scan, and his lipase levels have been normal throughout admission. His hematocrit has dropped from 27 to 24, but there are no signs of bleeding. His fluid status is positive, and he is being closely monitored for signs of fluid overload. His respiratory failure is stable, and he is being weaned off sedation. His mental status is altered, likely due to a combination of factors including progressive decline, chronic process, and possible communicating hydrocephalus. He has leukocytosis, which is trending down, and his HIV is being managed with held HAART therapy.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pancreatitis-related complications: pseudocyst rupture, infection, or abscess formation.
2. Respiratory failure: progression to ARDS, respiratory arrest, or pneumonia.
3. Fluid overload: cardiac failure, pulmonary edema, or electrolyte imbalance.
4. Leukocytosis: infection, sepsis, or hematological disorder.
5. HIV-related complications: opportunistic infections, lymphoma, or HIV-related organ failure.
6. Delirium: progression to coma, or neurological deterioration.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, or hyperkalemia.
8. Acidosis: metabolic acidosis or lactic acidosis.
9. Pneumonia: hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
10. Sepsis: septic shock or multi-organ failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's pancreatitis and respiratory status closely.
2. Consider re-imaging the patient if his condition deteriorates.
3. Hold off on transfusions for now, and monitor his hematocrit.
4. Manage his fluid status carefully, and monitor his urine output and vital signs.
5. Wean him off sedation gradually.
6. Continue to monitor his mental status and neurological function.
7. Consider restarting HAART therapy when his condition stabilizes.
8. Monitor his electrolyte levels and acid-base status closely.
9. Consider prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
10. Plan for a family meeting to discuss the patient's code status and end-of-life care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV, pancreatitis, and alcohol abuse, who was transferred to the ICU from the operating room (OSH) due to pancreatitis and altered mental status. He is currently intubated and sedated, but is slowly improving in his responsiveness to outside stimuli.

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including:

1. Severe pancreatitis with evidence of pseudocyst on CT scan, likely secondary to ethanol abuse or drug reaction.
2. Altered mental status, likely multifactorial, with a history of progressive decline over the past year.
3. Respiratory failure, with stable ABG values over the past two days, but signs of fluid overload on CXR.
4. Leukocytosis, likely due to pancreatitis, but without a clear source.
5. Electrolyte and fluid disorder, with a drop in hematocrit from 27% to 24% over the past day, despite net positive fluid balance.
6. Acidosis, metabolic, likely secondary to pancreatitis and electrolyte imbalance.
7. Atrial fibrillation, which may be contributing to his altered mental status.

The patient's medical team is planning to:

1. Start jejunal feedings through a Dobhoff tube, pending further discussion with the pancreas team.
2. Hold HAART medications per conversation with the patient's PCP/ID MD.
3. Manage pain with fentanyl and consider weaning sedation.
4. Monitor for signs of bleeding and transfusion requirements.
5. Continue to evaluate the patient's mental status and consider further imaging or neurology consultation.
6. Manage the patient's electrolyte and fluid disorder, and consider re-imaging if clinically deteriorates.
7. Plan for a family meeting to discuss the patient's code status and advance directives.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pancreatitis-related complications, such as bleeding, infection, or pancreatic fistula.
2. Respiratory failure, potentially requiring mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, secondary to atrial fibrillation.
4. Neurological complications, such as seizures or increased intracranial pressure, secondary to altered mental status.
5. Infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections, secondary to immunocompromise.
6. Gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation, secondary to pancreatitis.
7. Electrolyte and fluid disorder, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias or seizures.

The patient's code status is DNR, with a preference for a dignified death and no prolonged mechanical ventilation."

   Assessment and Plan
   74yoM h/o HIV on HAART and EtOH abuse transfered from OSH with
   pancreatitis and altered mental status, continues to be intubated and
   altered, but is slowly improving in his responsiveness to outside
   stimuli.
   #.  Pancreatitis - Severe pancreatitis as demonstrated on CT with
   evidence of pseudocyst.  Etiology likely secondary to EtOH vs drug
   reaction, HAART therapy held at OSH.  Cholelithiasis unlikely given
   unremarkable RUQ u/s.  Lipase has been normal through admission.
   [**Last Name (un) 2245**] criteria:  40% chance mortality.
   - Per pancreas team will start TF as tolerated with goal determined by
   nutrition by Dobhoff
   --hold HAART meds per conversation with pt's PCP/ID MD.
   --pain control  with Fentanyl
   --If clinically deteriorates, consider re-imaging
   # Dropping hematocrit
 Hct trend down but now stable.  Hemodynamically
   stable and able to wean off presssor overnight.  No gross bleeding
   --[**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   #.  Respiratory failure: ABG stable. Evidence of fluid overload on CXR
   but stable respiratory status.
   --wean vent as tolerated
   #.  Altered mental status-- Likely multifactorial and h/o progressive
   decline for one year. CT scan showed moderate ventriculomegaly,
   out-of-proportion to sulcal enlargement, concerning for communicating
   hydrocephalus or a chronic process. TSH normal.  CSF negative.
   --Will continue to wean sedation today aand reassess mental status
   #.  Leukocytosis -  Trending upwards without clear source to date, not
   on antibiotics. Still with low grade fever yesterday 100.  Cultures
   negative to date.  Likely from pancreatitis.
   - Surveillance Cx's q3 days --> next [**10-3**]
   - Continue to hold Abx until clear source
   #.  HIV - Diagnosed in [**2124**] and long-term HAART therapy, currently held
   given concern for pancreatitis.
   - Currently holding HAART. Was taking Combivir/Sustiva before
   admission.
   - Spoke with ID PCP who deferred initiating HAART to us, but was ok
   with not starting it during acute illness
   #.  FEN: Start enteral feeds through Dobhoff
   - ISS
   - lytes [**Hospital1 7**], replete as needed
   #.  PPX:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots and SC heparin.
   -Bowel regimen not needed currently.
   -Pain management with fentanyl, will try to wean
   #.  ACCESS: PIV's, Central line on R placed yesterday.  Art line on R
   #.  CODE STATUS: Per report, DNR, ok to intubate but he has said he
   would like a

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV on HAART therapy and EtOH abuse, who was transferred to the ICU from the emergency department with pancreatitis and altered mental status. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated. His hemodynamic status is stable, and he is being weaned off pressors. His hematocrit is trending downwards but is now stable. He has a pseudocyst on CT scan, and his lipase levels have been normal throughout admission. He is on pain management with fentanyl and is being weaned off sedation. His mental status is improving, but he is still altered. He has leukocytosis, which is likely related to pancreatitis. He is being monitored for sepsis and is not on antibiotics yet. He has a central line and arterial line in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient's code status is DNR, but he has expressed a desire for a dignified death and does not want prolonged mechanical ventilation. The family is considering this option, and the patient's son will make the final decision.
2. Pancreatitis-related complications: The patient has severe pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pseudocyst rupture, abscess formation, and sepsis.
3. HIV-related complications: The patient is HIV-positive and is not currently on HAART therapy due to concerns about pancreatitis. He has a history of long-term HAART therapy, and his HIV viral load is unknown.
4. Leukocytosis-related complications: The patient has leukocytosis, which can be a sign of sepsis or infection. He is being monitored for sepsis, but if left untreated, it can lead to organ failure and death.
5. Fluid overload: The patient has evidence of fluid overload on his chest X-ray, which can lead to respiratory failure and cardiac complications.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated, and his ABG results are stable. However, he has evidence of fluid overload, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
7. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is improving, but he is still altered. He has a history of progressive decline, and his mental status may continue to deteriorate if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
2. Continue to wean the patient off sedation and assess his mental status regularly.
3. Monitor the patient's leukocytosis and consider starting antibiotics if sepsis is suspected.
4. Continue to manage the patient's pain with fentanyl and consider alternative pain management options if necessary.
5. Consider re-imaging the patient if his condition deteriorates.
6. Continue to hold HAART therapy until the patient's pancreatitis resolves.
7. Monitor the patient's fluid overload and consider diuretic therapy if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   74yoM h/o HIV on HAART and EtOH abuse transfered from OSH with
   pancreatitis and altered mental status, continues to be intubated and
   altered, but is slowly improving in his responsiveness to outside
   stimuli.
   #.  Pancreatitis - Severe pancreatitis as demonstrated on CT with
   evidence of pseudocyst.  Etiology likely secondary to EtOH vs drug
   reaction, HAART therapy held at OSH.  Cholelithiasis unlikely given
   unremarkable RUQ u/s.  Lipase has been normal through admission.
   [**Last Name (un) 2245**] criteria:  40% chance mortality.
   - Per pancreas team will start TF as tolerated with goal determined by
   nutrition by Dobhoff
   --hold HAART meds per conversation with pt's PCP/ID MD.
   --pain control  with Fentanyl
   --If clinically deteriorates, consider re-imaging
   # Dropping hematocrit
 Hct trend down but now stable.  Hemodynamically
   stable and able to wean off presssor overnight.  No gross bleeding
   --[**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   #.  Respiratory failure: ABG stable. Evidence of fluid overload on CXR
   but stable respiratory status.
   --wean vent as tolerated
   #.  Altered mental status-- Likely multifactorial and h/o progressive
   decline for one year. CT scan showed moderate ventriculomegaly,
   out-of-proportion to sulcal enlargement, concerning for communicating
   hydrocephalus or a chronic process. TSH normal.  CSF negative.
   --Will continue to wean sedation today aand reassess mental status
   #.  Leukocytosis -  Trending upwards without clear source to date, not
   on antibiotics. Still with low grade fever yesterday 100.  Cultures
   negative to date.  Likely from pancreatitis.
   - Surveillance Cx's q3 days --> next [**10-3**]
   - Continue to hold Abx until clear source
   #.  HIV - Diagnosed in [**2124**] and long-term HAART therapy, currently held
   given concern for pancreatitis.
   - Currently holding HAART. Was taking Combivir/Sustiva before
   admission.
   - Spoke with ID PCP who deferred initiating HAART to us, but was ok
   with not starting it during acute illness
   #.  FEN: Start enteral feeds through Dobhoff
   - lytes [**Hospital1 7**], replete as needed
   #.  PPX:

   -Bowel regimen not needed currently.
   -Pain management with fentanyl, will try to wean
   #.  ACCESS: PIV's, Central line on R placed yesterday.  Art line on R

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74yoM h/o HIV on HAART and EtOH abuse transfered from OSH with
   pancreatitis and altered mental status, continues to be intubated and
   altered, but is slowly improving in his responsiveness to outside
   stimuli.
   #.  Pancreatitis - Severe pancreatitis as demonstrated on CT with
   evidence of pseudocyst.  Etiology likely secondary to EtOH vs drug
   reaction, HAART therapy held at OSH.  Cholelithiasis unlikely given
   unremarkable RUQ u/s.  Lipase has been normal through admission.
   [**Last Name (un) 2245**] criteria:  40% chance mortality.
   - Per pancreas team will start TF as tolerated with goal determined by
   nutrition by Dobhoff
   --hold HAART meds per conversation with pt's PCP/ID MD.
   --pain control  with Fentanyl
   --If clinically deteriorates, consider re-imaging
   # Dropping hematocrit
 Hct trend down but now stable.  Hemodynamically
   stable and able to wean off presssor overnight.  No gross bleeding
   --[**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   #.  Respiratory failure: ABG stable. Evidence of fluid overload on CXR
   but stable respiratory status.
   --wean vent as tolerated
   #.  Altered mental status-- Likely multifactorial and h/o progressive
   decline for one year. CT scan showed moderate ventriculomegaly,
   out-of-proportion to sulcal enlargement, concerning for communicating
   hydrocephalus or a chronic process. TSH normal.  CSF negative.
   --Will continue to wean sedation today aand reassess mental status
   #.  Leukocytosis -  Trending upwards without clear source to date, not
   on antibiotics. Still with low grade fever yesterday 100.  Cultures
   negative to date.  Likely from pancreatitis.
   - Surveillance Cx's q3 days --> next [**10-3**]
   - Continue to hold Abx until clear source
   #.  HIV - Diagnosed in [**2124**] and long-term HAART therapy, currently held
   given concern for pancreatitis.
   - Currently holding HAART. Was taking Combivir/Sustiva before
   admission.
   - Spoke with ID PCP who deferred initiating HAART to us, but was ok
   with not starting it during acute illness
   #.  FEN: Start enteral feeds through Dobhoff

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV, HAART therapy, and EtOH abuse, who was transferred to the ICU with pancreatitis, altered mental status, and severe respiratory failure. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His hemodynamic status is stable, and he is able to wean off pressors. His hematocrit is stable, but his leukocytosis is trending upwards without a clear source. He has a history of progressive decline over the past year, and his CT scan shows moderate ventriculomegaly, which is concerning for communicating hydrocephalus or a chronic process. He is not receiving antibiotics, and his cultures are negative to date.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is severe, and there is a risk of further complications, such as pancreatic necrosis, abscess formation, or fistula development.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of further deterioration, particularly if he develops a secondary infection or if his mechanical ventilation is discontinued.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is trending upwards, and there is a risk of further complications, such as sepsis or organ dysfunction, if the underlying cause is not identified and treated.
4. Communicating Hydrocephalus: The patient's CT scan shows moderate ventriculomegaly, which is concerning for communicating hydrocephalus. If this is the case, there is a risk of further complications, such as increased intracranial pressure, seizures, or brain herniation.
5. HIV-Related Complications: The patient has a history of HIV, and there is a risk of HIV-related complications, such as opportunistic infections or immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, particularly if he is not receiving HAART therapy.
6. EtOH Withdrawal: The patient has a history of EtOH abuse, and there is a risk of EtOH withdrawal syndrome if he is not receiving adequate treatment.
7. Pain Management: The patient is receiving pain management with fentanyl, but there is a risk of further complications, such as respiratory depression or tolerance, if his pain is not adequately managed.
8. DVT and VAP: The patient is at risk of developing DVT and VAP due to his prolonged immobility and invasive lines."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   stimuli.
   #.  Pancreatitis - Severe pancreatitis as demonstrated on CT with
   evidence of pseudocyst.  Etiology likely secondary to EtOH vs drug
   reaction, HAART therapy held at OSH.  Cholelithiasis unlikely given
   unremarkable RUQ u/s.  Lipase has been normal through admission.

   --pain control  with Fentanyl
   --If clinically deteriorates, consider re-imaging
   # Dropping hematocrit
 Hct trend down but now stable.  Hemodynamically
   stable and able to wean off presssor overnight.  No gross bleeding
   --Have stopped lab draws, so no more monitoring of Hct
   #.  Respiratory failure: ABG stable. Evidence of fluid overload on CXR
   but stable respiratory status.
   --Keep on vent as
   #.  Altered mental status-- Likely multifactorial and h/o progressive
   decline for one year. CT scan showed moderate ventriculomegaly,
   out-of-proportion to sulcal enlargement, concerning for communicating
   hydrocephalus or a chronic process. TSH normal.  CSF negative.
   --Will continue to wean sedation today aand reassess mental status
   #.  Leukocytosis -  Trending upwards without clear source to date, not
   on antibiotics. Still with low grade fever yesterday 100.  Cultures
   negative to date.  Likely from pancreatitis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV on HAART therapy and EtOH abuse, who was transferred to the ICU with pancreatitis and altered mental status. The patient's condition is currently stable, with no significant changes in vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, or laboratory results.

The patient's main diagnoses are:

1. Pancreatitis, acute: Severe pancreatitis with evidence of pseudocyst on CT scan, likely secondary to EtOH or drug reaction.
2. HIV: Diagnosed in [**2124**] and long-term HAART therapy, currently held due to concern for pancreatitis.
3. Anemia, other: Hemoglobin trending downwards, but currently stable.
4. Hypotension (not shock): Patient's blood pressure is stable, but with a trend of decreasing hematocrit.
5. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): Patient is on mechanical ventilation, with stable ABG results and evidence of fluid overload on CXR.
6. Leukocytosis: Trending upwards without clear source, likely related to pancreatitis.
7. Atrial fibrillation: Patient's heart rhythm is stable, but with a risk of stroke.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pancreatitis-related complications: Further worsening of pancreatitis, development of pseudocyst, or pancreatic abscess.
2. HIV-related complications: Development of opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis pneumonia or tuberculosis, or progression of HIV disease.
3. Anemia-related complications: Further worsening of anemia, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, or decreased cognitive function.
4. Hypotension-related complications: Development of shock, cardiac arrhythmias, or decreased organ perfusion.
5. Respiratory failure-related complications: Development of ARDS, respiratory acidosis, or failure to wean from mechanical ventilation.
6. Leukocytosis-related complications: Development of sepsis, bacteremia, or disseminated intravascular coagulation.
7. Atrial fibrillation-related complications: Development of stroke, cardiac arrhythmias, or decreased cardiac output.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuing tube feeds with a goal of 60cc/hr as tolerated.
2. Holding HAART therapy until the patient's pancreatitis improves.
3. Managing pain with fentanyl.
4. Weaning sedation and reassessing mental status.
5. Surveillance cultures every 3 days.
6. Continuing to hold antibiotics until a clear source of infection is identified.
7. Monitoring for signs of DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the healthcare proxy is his son, who lives in [**Name (NI) 11149**]. The patient's disposition is pending improvement in mental status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV, pancreatitis, and altered mental status. He was transferred to the ICU from the operating room with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 10. He is currently intubated and sedated, with a heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 97/59 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His respiratory support includes a ventilator with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, leukocytosis, and hyperglycemia. His kidney function is mildly impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. His liver function tests (LFTs) are slightly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 37 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 28 IU/L.

The patient's medical history includes HIV, pancreatitis, and ethanol abuse. He is currently receiving treatment for pancreatitis, including antibiotics and supportive care. His family has decided to terminate his life-sustaining interventions, including his ventilator and pressors, and to make him a comfort measure only (CMO) patient.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support includes a ventilator, which may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory support increases the risk of pneumonia, which may be exacerbated by his altered mental status and inability to cough.
3. Sepsis: The patient's pancreatitis and altered mental status increase the risk of sepsis, which may lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial flutter and hypotension increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, which may lead to cardiac arrest.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's pancreatitis and altered mental status increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which may lead to hypovolemic shock.
6. Renal failure: The patient's kidney function is mildly impaired, which may worsen if not managed properly.
7. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests are slightly elevated, which may indicate liver dysfunction.
8. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and inability to cough increase the risk of infection, which may lead to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
9. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to eat and his pancreatitis increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies, which may lead to malnutrition and worsening of his condition.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for various medical complications due to his underlying medical conditions and his current treatment. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a chief complaint of severe pancreatitis, who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital. He has a history of HIV/AIDS, EtOH abuse, and pancreatitis. He is intubated and altered, and his family has chosen to focus on comfort measures and discontinue aggressive care. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 102.2°F (39°C)
* Heart rate: 138 bpm
* Blood pressure: 132/98 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* SpO2: 96%

The patient has been taking midazolam, norepinephrine, and fentanyl, but his pressors were stopped in the morning. He is currently extubated and not receiving any interventions except for vital sign monitoring.

Lab results show:

* WBC: 18.4
* Hct: 27.5%
* Plt: 543
* Cr: 1.1 mg/dL
* TCO2: 27 mmHg
* Glucose: 147 mg/dL
* Other labs: elevated ALT, AST, and LDH, decreased albumin, and elevated calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea may indicate the development of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and he is not receiving any respiratory interventions except for oxygen therapy.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is not receiving any interventions to improve kidney function.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is elevated, and he is not receiving any interventions to control his blood sugar.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels are elevated, which may indicate an electrolyte imbalance.
6. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an infection.
7. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is severe, and he may be at risk for complications such as necrosis, abscess formation, and sepsis.
8. HIV/AIDS: The patient's HIV/AIDS may increase his risk for opportunistic infections and complications.
9. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be related to his pancreatitis, HIV/AIDS, or other underlying conditions.
10. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may increase his risk for stroke and other cardiac complications."
