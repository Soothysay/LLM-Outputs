   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  52 y.o. Female with h.o. metastatic Melanoma to
   lungs on clinic trial, h.o. DVT/PE s/p IVC filter initially admitted
   for HA, n/v, poor PO intake. Transferred to the ICU for A. flutter with
   RVR w/ hypotension.
   .
   ##. A. flutter with RVR: Pt has history of SVT vs AVNRT vs A. flutter
   with RVR. Pt noted to have SVT this AM and showed A. flutter with RVR
   after receiving Adenosine x 2. Currently in A. Flutter.  Flutter is
   notoriously difficult to rate control, and if this continues to be an
   issue cardioversion without TEE would be warranted given a/c on
   lovenox.
   - will bolus 1L NS x 1
   - continue to follow urine output
   - reintroduce PO regimen of Diltiazem 90mg QID and wean off drip
   - will continue Metoprolol 75 TID for now
   - currently on Lovenox
   - continue on tele
   - pt has 2 PIV for access
   .
   ## Hyponatremia/Concentrated Urine:  In light of labs inconsistent with
   volume depletion and a drop in Na with IV hydration, and sodium avid
   urine in the face of hyponatremia, (urine Na
 49).  Suspect SIADH [**1-23**]
   lung mets.
   - free water restriction.
   .
   ##. Hypotension: Currently improved with improved rate control
   .
   ##. N/V: Pt endorsed nausea over the past 2 weeks which lead to her
   admission as well as emesis x 3 days. Pt also endorses 3 days of
   diarrhea. Given the concomittant emesis, diarrhea which has now
   resolved I suspect that this may be viral gastroenteritis. Her diarrhea
   has now resolved, she is tolerating clear. Her other work-up has
   included CT head which was negative for any masses. CT abd/pelvis was
   negative for any signs of intra-abdominal pathology such as ileus,
   extrinsic compression. Abdominal exam is benign.
   - ADAT
   - Continue home regimen of Reglan, Compazine, Zofran prn
   ##. h.o.PE: Pt has history of P. Embolism even on Lovenox. Pt was
   previously on Coumadin for her A. fib however this appears to have been
   discontinued after her episodes of hemoptysis. Will continue on
   Lovenox, there is mention on admission note that she developed
   P.Embolism even with filter in place.
   - will increase dose of Lovenox to 150 SC BID
   - discuss with oncologist re: anticoagulation history, ?P. Embolism on
   Lovenox and filter
   ##. Metastatic Melanoma: Pt has mets to the lung and is currently being
   followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 948**]. She is currently on Ipilimumab as part of
   the compassionate trial for Monotherapy in Subjects with
   Unresectable Stage III or IV Melanoma.
   - notify pt's Oncologist of [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admission
   - f/u onc recs, if any
   ##. Ppx: Currently on Lovenox S.C. [**Hospital1 **], home regimen of PPI.
   ##. Sinusitis: Pt was started on Ceftriaxone for tx of acute Sinusitis
   that was thought to be related to her admission HA. On review of CT
   scan no signs of sinusitis.
   - will d/c Ceftriaxone
   ##. ACCESS: PIV's
   ##. CODE STATUS: Confirmed FULL CODE
   ##. DISPOSITION: Pending resolution of symptoms.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with metastatic melanoma to the lungs, currently on a clinic trial, and admitted to the ICU for atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and hypotension. The patient has a history of DVT/PE, and an IVC filter was placed initially.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38°C (100.4°F)
* Heart rate: 92 bpm (normal range: 79-153 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 99/48 mmHg (normal range: 90/48-129/89 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 28 inspirations per minute (normal range: 22-36 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 95%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial flutter

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the lack of assessment in certain areas, including peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and abdominal examinations.

Lab results show:

* Sodium: 289 mmol/L
* Potassium: 4.1 mmol/L
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 146 mg/dL
* Other lab results are listed in the note.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Atrial flutter with RVR: The patient has a history of SVT, AVNRT, and A. flutter with RVR. Cardioversion without TEE may be warranted given the patient's ongoing arrhythmia and anticoagulation therapy with Lovenox.
* Hyponatremia/concentrated urine: The patient has hyponatremia, and the urine sodium level is 49 mEq/L, suggesting SIADH. Free water restriction is recommended.
* Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has improved with improved rate control.
* Nausea and vomiting: The patient has a history of nausea and vomiting, which may be related to viral gastroenteritis. The patient is tolerating clear fluids, and ADAT and anti-emetic medications are being continued.
* History of PE: The patient has a history of PE, even on Lovenox. The patient will continue on Lovenox, and the dose will be increased to 150 SC BID. The patient's oncologist will be notified regarding anticoagulation history and potential PE on Lovenox and filter.
* Metastatic melanoma: The patient has metastatic melanoma to the lungs and is currently on Ipilimumab as part of a compassionate trial.
* Ppx: The patient is currently on Lovenox and a home regimen of PPI.
* Sinusitis: The patient was started on Ceftriaxone for acute sinusitis, but no signs of sinusitis were seen on CT scan. The antibiotic will be discontinued.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Cardiac arrhythmia: The patient's atrial flutter with RVR may lead to cardiac arrest or stroke if not adequately managed.
* Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may lead to seizures, coma, or death if not treated promptly.
* Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may lead to organ failure or death if not adequately managed.
* Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition if not managed promptly.
* PE: The patient's history of PE may lead to recurrent PE or other thrombotic events if not adequately managed.
* Metastatic melanoma: The patient's metastatic melanoma may lead to further progression of the disease and potentially life-threatening complications.
* Sinusitis: The patient's sinusitis may lead to further complications, such as orbital cellulitis or meningitis, if not adequately managed."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  52 y.o. Female with h.o. metastatic Melanoma to
   lungs on clinic trial, h.o. DVT/PE s/p IVC filter initially admitted
   for HA, n/v, poor PO intake. Transferred to the ICU for A. flutter with
   RVR w/ hypotension.
   .
   ##. A. flutter with RVR: Pt has history of SVT vs AVNRT vs A. flutter
   with RVR. Pt noted to have SVT this AM and showed A. flutter with RVR
   after receiving Adenosine x 2. Currently in A. Flutter.  Flutter is
   notoriously difficult to rate control, and if this continues to be an
   issue cardioversion without TEE would be warranted given a/c on
   lovenox.
   - will bolus 1L NS x 1
   - continue to follow urine output
   - reintroduce PO regimen of Diltiazem 90mg QID and wean off drip
   - will continue Metoprolol 75 TID for now
   - currently on Lovenox
   - continue on tele
   - pt has 2 PIV for access
   .
   ## Hyponatremia/Concentrated Urine:  In light of labs inconsistent with
   volume depletion and a drop in Na with IV hydration, and sodium avid
   urine in the face of hyponatremia, (urine Na
 49).  Suspect SIADH [**1-23**]
   lung mets.
   - free water restriction.
   .
   ##. Hypotension: Currently improved with improved rate control
   - echo to determine why patient was pre-load dependant
   .
   ##. N/V: Pt endorsed nausea over the past 2 weeks which lead to her
   admission as well as emesis x 3 days. Pt also endorses 3 days of
   diarrhea. Given the concomittant emesis, diarrhea which has now
   resolved I suspect that this may be viral gastroenteritis. Her diarrhea
   has now resolved, she is tolerating clear. Her other work-up has
   included CT head which was negative for any masses. CT abd/pelvis was
   negative for any signs of intra-abdominal pathology such as ileus,
   extrinsic compression. Abdominal exam is benign.
   - ADAT
   - Continue home regimen of Reglan, Compazine, Zofran prn
   ##. h.o.PE: Pt has history of P. Embolism even on Lovenox. Pt was
   previously on Coumadin for her A. fib however this appears to have been
   discontinued after her episodes of hemoptysis. Will continue on
   Lovenox, there is mention on admission note that she developed
   P.Embolism even with filter in place.
   - will increase dose of Lovenox to 150 SC BID
   - discuss with oncologist re: anticoagulation history, ?P. Embolism on
   Lovenox and filter
   ##. Metastatic Melanoma: Pt has mets to the lung and is currently being
   followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 948**]. She is currently on Ipilimumab as part of
   the compassionate trial for Monotherapy in Subjects with
   Unresectable Stage III or IV Melanoma.
   - notify pt's Oncologist of [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admission
   - f/u onc recs, if any
   ##. Ppx: Currently on Lovenox S.C. [**Hospital1 **], home regimen of PPI.
   ##. Sinusitis: Pt was started on Ceftriaxone for tx of acute Sinusitis
   that was thought to be related to her admission HA. On review of CT
   scan no signs of sinusitis.
   - will d/c Ceftriaxone
   ##. ACCESS: PIV's
   ##. CODE STATUS: Confirmed FULL CODE
   ##. DISPOSITION: Pending resolution of symptoms.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with metastatic melanoma to the lungs, admitted to the ICU for atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and hypotension.

The patient has a history of SVT, AVNRT, and atrial flutter with RVR. She was started on metoprolol 75 mg TID, and her atrial flutter is currently rate-controlled. The plan is to bolus 1L NS, continue to follow urine output, reintroduce PO regimen of diltiazem 90mg QID, and wean off the drip.

The patient also has hyponatremia, which is suspected to be due to SIADH caused by lung mets. She is being restricted from free water.

The patient has a history of hypotension, which has improved with improved rate control. An echo is planned to determine why the patient was preload-dependent.

The patient has a history of nausea and vomiting, which is suspected to be due to viral gastroenteritis. She is being treated with ADAT and will continue her home regimen of Reglan, Compazine, and Zofran PRN.

The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) even on Lovenox, and is currently on Lovenox 40 mg SC BID. The dose will be increased to 150 mg SC BID.

The patient has metastatic melanoma and is currently on Ipilimumab as part of a compassionate trial. She is being followed by her oncologist, Dr. [Last Name], and will be notified of her hospital admission.

The patient is currently on Lovenox and a PPI, and is being treated for acute sinusitis with Ceftriaxone, which will be discontinued due to no signs of sinusitis on CT scan.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias due to atrial flutter and RVR
* Volume depletion due to hyponatremia and SIADH
* Hypotension due to preload dependence and cardiac arrhythmias
* Nausea and vomiting due to viral gastroenteritis
* Pulmonary embolism due to history of PE and ongoing anticoagulation therapy
* Metastatic melanoma progression and potential complications such as bleeding, infection, and organ failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  52 y.o. Female with h.o. metastatic Melanoma to
   lungs on clinic trial, h.o. DVT/PE s/p IVC filter initially admitted
   for HA, n/v, poor PO intake. Transferred to the ICU for A. flutter with
   RVR w/ hypotension.
   .
   ##. A. flutter with RVR: Pt has history of SVT vs AVNRT vs A. flutter
   with RVR. Pt noted to have SVT this AM and showed A. flutter with RVR
   after receiving Adenosine x 2. Currently in A. Flutter.  Flutter is
   notoriously difficult to rate control, and if this continues to be an
   issue cardioversion without TEE would be warranted given a/c on
   lovenox.
   - continue to follow urine output
   - Stop dilt and metop, start amiodarone, if persistent would d/c
   cardiovert her
   - currently on Lovenox
   - continue on tele
   - pt has 2 PIV for access
   .
   ## Hyponatremia/Concentrated Urine:  In light of labs inconsistent with
   volume depletion and a drop in Na with IV hydration, and sodium avid
   urine in the face of hyponatremia, (urine Na
 49).  Suspect SIADH [**1-23**]
   lung mets.
   - 2L free water restriction.
   .
   ##. Hypotension: Currently improved with improved rate control
   - echo shows preserved EF,  no diastolic dysfunction
   .
   ##. N/V: Pt endorsed nausea over the past 2 weeks which lead to her
   admission as well as emesis x 3 days. Pt also endorses 3 days of
   diarrhea. Given the concomittant emesis, diarrhea which has now
   resolved I suspect that this may be viral gastroenteritis. Her diarrhea
   has now resolved, she is tolerating clear. Her other work-up has
   included CT head which was negative for any masses. CT abd/pelvis was
   negative for any signs of intra-abdominal pathology such as ileus,
   extrinsic compression. Abdominal exam is benign.
   - ADAT
   - Continue home regimen of Reglan, Compazine, Zofran prn
   .
   ##. h.o.PE: Pt has history of P. Embolism even on Lovenox. Pt was
   previously on Coumadin for her A. fib however this appears to have been
   discontinued after her episodes of hemoptysis. Will continue on
   Lovenox, there is mention on admission note that she developed
   P.Embolism even with filter in place.
   - will increase dose of Lovenox to 150 SC BID
   - discuss with oncologist re: anticoagulation history, ?P. Embolism on
   Lovenox and filter
   .
   ##. Metastatic Melanoma: Pt has mets to the lung and is currently being
   followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 948**]. She is currently on Ipilimumab as part of
   the compassionate trial for Monotherapy in Subjects with
   Unresectable Stage III or IV Melanoma.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 948**]
s input greatly appreciated
   - f/u onc recs, if any
    .
   ##. Ppx: Currently on Lovenox S.C. [**Hospital1 **], home regimen of PPI.
   .
   ##. Sinusitis: Pt was started on Ceftriaxone for tx of acute Sinusitis
   that was thought to be related to her admission HA. On review of CT
   scan no signs of sinusitis.
   - will d/c Ceftriaxone
   ##. ACCESS: PIV's
   ##. CODE STATUS: Confirmed FULL CODE
   ##. DISPOSITION: Pending resolution of symptoms.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with metastatic melanoma to the lungs, admitted to the ICU for atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and hypotension. She has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and is currently on lovenox. Her condition has improved with improved rate control, but she remains at risk for cardiac complications. She has hyponatremia, which is suspected to be due to SIADH caused by lung metastases. She also has nausea and vomiting, which is suspected to be due to viral gastroenteritis. Her code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial flutter with RVR is a significant risk factor for cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest and arrhythmias.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is a potential complication that can lead to seizures, coma, and even death if not treated promptly.
3. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition if not managed properly.
4. DVT/PE: The patient's history of DVT and PE makes her at risk for recurrent thrombotic events, which can be life-threatening.
5. Metastatic melanoma: The patient's metastatic melanoma is a significant risk factor for her overall prognosis and can lead to various complications, including bleeding, infection, and organ failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment as needed to prevent cardiac complications.
2. Manage the patient's hyponatremia by restricting free water intake and monitoring electrolyte levels.
3. Continue to manage the patient's nausea and vomiting with antiemetic medications and consider further workup if symptoms persist.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's DVT/PE risk and adjust treatment as needed to prevent recurrent thrombotic events.
5. Discuss the patient's metastatic melanoma with the oncologist and consider further treatment options to improve her prognosis."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  52 y.o. Female with h.o. metastatic Melanoma to
   lungs on clinic trial, h.o. DVT/PE s/p IVC filter initially admitted
   for HA, n/v, poor PO intake. Transferred to the ICU for A. flutter with
   RVR w/ hypotension.
   .
   ##. A. flutter with RVR: Pt has history of SVT vs AVNRT vs A. flutter
   with RVR. Pt noted to have SVT this AM and showed A. flutter with RVR
   after receiving Adenosine x 2. Currently in A. Flutter.  Flutter is
   notoriously difficult to rate control, and if this continues to be an
   issue cardioversion without TEE would be warranted given a/c on
   lovenox.
   - continue to follow urine output
   - Stop dilt and metop, start amiodarone, if persistent would d/c
   cardiovert her
   - currently on Lovenox
   - continue on tele
   - pt has 2 PIV for access
   .
   ## Hyponatremia/Concentrated Urine:  In light of labs inconsistent with
   volume depletion and a drop in Na with IV hydration, and sodium avid
   urine in the face of hyponatremia, (urine Na
 49).  Suspect SIADH [**1-23**]
   lung mets.
   - 2L free water restriction.
   .
   ##. Hypotension: Currently improved with improved rate control
   - echo shows preserved EF,  no diastolic dysfunction
   .
   ##. N/V: Pt endorsed nausea over the past 2 weeks which lead to her
   admission as well as emesis x 3 days. Pt also endorses 3 days of
   diarrhea. Given the concomittant emesis, diarrhea which has now
   resolved I suspect that this may be viral gastroenteritis. Her diarrhea
   has now resolved, she is tolerating clear. Her other work-up has
   included CT head which was negative for any masses. CT abd/pelvis was
   negative for any signs of intra-abdominal pathology such as ileus,
   extrinsic compression. Abdominal exam is benign.
   - ADAT
   - Continue home regimen of Reglan, Compazine, Zofran prn
   .
   ##. h.o.PE: Pt has history of P. Embolism even on Lovenox. Pt was
   previously on Coumadin for her A. fib however this appears to have been
   discontinued after her episodes of hemoptysis. Will continue on
   Lovenox, there is mention on admission note that she developed
   P.Embolism even with filter in place.
   - will increase dose of Lovenox to 150 SC BID
   - discuss with oncologist re: anticoagulation history, ?P. Embolism on
   Lovenox and filter
   .
   ##. Metastatic Melanoma: Pt has mets to the lung and is currently being
   followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 948**]. She is currently on Ipilimumab as part of
   the compassionate trial for Monotherapy in Subjects with
   Unresectable Stage III or IV Melanoma.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with metastatic melanoma to the lungs, currently on a clinic trial, and admitted to the ICU for atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and hypotension. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 99/48 mmHg. The patient is receiving diltiazem and metoprolol for rate control, but the atrial flutter persists. The plan is to continue to follow urine output, stop dilt and metop, and start amiodarone if the atrial flutter persists. Cardioversion without TEE may be warranted if the patient's condition does not improve.

The patient has hyponatremia with concentrated urine, which is suspected to be due to SIADH caused by lung metastases. A 2L free water restriction is planned.

The patient has a history of hypotension, which has improved with improved rate control. An echocardiogram shows preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with no diastolic dysfunction.

The patient has a history of nausea and vomiting, which is suspected to be due to viral gastroenteritis. The patient's diarrhea has resolved, and she is tolerating clear fluids.

The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) despite being on Lovenox. The dose of Lovenox is being increased to 150 SC BID, and the patient's oncologist will be consulted regarding anticoagulation history and the risk of PE on Lovenox.

The patient has metastatic melanoma and is currently receiving Ipilimumab as part of a compassionate trial. The patient's oncologist will be consulted regarding further treatment recommendations.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial flutter may persist or worsen, leading to cardiac complications.
2. SIADH: The patient's hyponatremia may worsen if the SIADH is not managed properly.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure may drop further, leading to organ dysfunction.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of PE and continued use of Lovenox increase the risk of further embolic events.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of nausea and vomiting may lead to further gastrointestinal complications.
6. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and history of sinusitis increase the risk of infection.
7. Metastatic disease progression: The patient's metastatic melanoma may progress, leading to further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient, a 52-year-old female with metastatic melanoma to the lungs, is admitted to the ICU for atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response and hypotension. She has a history of DVT/PE, and an IVC filter was placed. The patient has been receiving amiodarone for rate control, and her heart rhythm is currently atrial flutter.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 39.1°C (102.3°F)
* Heart rate: 168 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 100/57 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Hemoglobin: 11.9 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 8.1 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count: 280 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL

The patient has a fever, which is not accompanied by leukocytosis. Possible etiologies include DVT, melanoma, or other infections. A CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast is ordered to look for metastases.

The patient has hyponatremia, with a sodium level of 134 mmol/L. Her urine sodium level is 49 mmol/L, suggesting sodium avidity. SIADH is suspected, possibly related to lung metastases. The patient is placed on a 1.5L free water restriction.

The patient has hypotension, which has improved with improved rate control. An echocardiogram shows preserved ejection fraction and no diastolic dysfunction.

The patient has nausea and vomiting, which have resolved. A CT head and abdomen/pelvis were negative for masses or intra-abdominal pathology. The patient is tolerating clear liquids.

The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism even on Lovenox. Her anticoagulation history is complicated, and she is currently on Lovenox. The dose is increased to 150 SC BID.

The patient has metastatic melanoma and is receiving Ipilimumab as part of a compassionate trial. Her oncologist is consulted for input.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, which may lead to cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
2. DVT/PE, which may lead to pulmonary embolism or other complications.
3. Hyponatremia, which may lead to seizures, coma, or other neurological complications.
4. SIADH, which may lead to electrolyte imbalances or other complications.
5. Hypotension, which may lead to organ dysfunction or failure.
6. Nausea and vomiting, which may lead to dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.
7. Pulmonary embolism, which may lead to respiratory failure or death.

These potential complications will require close monitoring and management by the healthcare team to prevent or minimize their occurrence."

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y.o. Female with h.o. metastatic Melanoma to lungs on clinic trial,
   h.o. DVT/PE s/p IVC filter initially admitted for HA, n/v, poor PO
   intake. Transferred to the ICU for A. flutter with RVR w/ hypotension.
   .
   ##. A. flutter with RVR: Pt has history of SVT vs AVNRT vs A. flutter
   with RVR. Pt noted to have SVT this AM and showed A. flutter with RVR
   after receiving Adenosine x 2. Currently in A. Flutter.  Flutter is
   notoriously difficult to rate control, and if this continues to be an
   issue cardioversion without TEE would be warranted given a/c on
   lovenox.
   - continue to follow urine output
   - started amiodarone, adding back dilt. For better rate control.
   - if persistently difficult to rate control would d/c cardiovert her
   - currently on Lovenox
   - continue on tele
   - pt has 2 PIV for access
   .
   ##Fever
 Her UA was negative, all other culture data is negative.  She
   is febrile in the absence of leukocytosis.  Other possible etiologies
   are DVT

   ##. N/V: Pt endorsed nausea over the past 2 weeks which lead to her
   admission as well as emesis x 3 days. Pt also endorses 3 days of
   diarrhea. Given the concomittant emesis, diarrhea which has now
   resolved I suspect that this may be viral gastroenteritis. Her diarrhea
   has now resolved, she is tolerating clear. Her other work-up has
   included CT head which was negative for any masses. CT abd/pelvis was
   negative for any signs of intra-abdominal pathology such as ileus,
   extrinsic compression. Abdominal exam is benign.

   previously on Coumadin for her A. fib however this appears to have been
   discontinued after her episodes of hemoptysis. Will continue on
   Lovenox, there is mention on admission note that she developed
   P.Embolism even with filter in place.
   - will increase dose of Lovenox to 150 SC BID

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with metastatic melanoma to the lungs, currently admitted to the ICU for atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and hypotension. She has a history of DVT/PE, and is on Lovenox therapy. The patient's condition is complicated by fever, hyponatremia, and nausea/vomiting.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial flutter with RVR is refractory to treatment, and cardioversion without TEE may be warranted. The patient's history of SVT, AVNRT, and A. flutter with RVR may indicate a higher risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of PE, and is currently on Lovenox therapy. The patient's recent CT scan did not show any signs of PE, but the patient's symptoms may still be related to PE.
3. DVT: The patient has a history of DVT, and is currently on Lovenox therapy. The patient's symptoms may still be related to DVT.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may be related to SIADH, lung mets, or other causes. The patient's sodium avid urine in the face of hyponatremia suggests SIADH.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's nausea/vomiting may be related to viral gastroenteritis, and the patient's diarrhea has now resolved.
6. Metastatic melanoma: The patient's metastatic melanoma to the lungs is a significant risk factor for cardiac and pulmonary complications.
7. Anticoagulation therapy: The patient's history of PE and DVT, and her current treatment with Lovenox, may increase the risk of bleeding complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and hemodynamics closely.
2. Consider cardioversion without TEE if the patient's atrial flutter with RVR persists.
3. Monitor the patient's urine output and sodium levels closely to assess for SIADH.
4. Consider increasing the dose of Lovenox to 150 SC BID to prevent further PE.
5. Discuss the patient's anticoagulation therapy with the oncologist to determine the best course of treatment.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms closely to assess for any signs of recurrence.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's metastatic melanoma and consider further treatment options."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with atrial flutter, hypotension, and fever. They have been admitted to the ICU and are receiving treatment for their conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, but their heart rate is still in atrial flutter, with rates up to 130s. They are receiving medication to control their heart rhythm and are being monitored closely for any changes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial flutter could potentially lead to atrial fibrillation, which could increase their risk of stroke, heart failure, and other complications.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could lead to decreased blood flow to vital organs, including the brain, heart, and kidneys, which could result in organ damage or failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever and hypotension could indicate the presence of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's fever and cough could indicate the presence of pneumonia, which could lead to respiratory failure and other complications.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's lower extremity edema and fever could indicate the presence of DVT, which could lead to pulmonary embolism and other complications.
6. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's atrial flutter and hypotension could increase their risk of cardiac arrest, which could result in death.
7. Renal Failure: The patient's hypotension and dehydration could lead to renal failure, which could result in the need for dialysis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and cardiac rhythm closely.
2. Adjust the patient's medication regimen as necessary to control their atrial flutter and hypotension.
3. Perform a thorough evaluation to determine the cause of the patient's fever and hypotension.
4. Consider the use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent the development of pneumonia.
5. Monitor the patient's lower extremities for signs of DVT and consider the use of prophylactic anticoagulation therapy.
6. Consider the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent the development of stress ulcers.
7. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider the use of diuretics to prevent the development of renal failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y.o. Female with h.o. metastatic Melanoma to lungs on clinic trial,
   h.o. DVT/PE s/p IVC filter initially admitted for HA, n/v, poor PO
   intake. Transferred to the ICU for A. flutter with RVR w/ hypotension.
   .
   ##. A. flutter with RVR: Pt has history of SVT vs AVNRT vs A. flutter
   with RVR. Pt continues in constant flutter with rates poorly controlled
   on amio and dilt gtt. BP has been stable and pt asymptomatic. Has
   better chance of converting electrically. Will discuss cardioversion
   without TEE since on Lovenox.
   - consult cards for cardioversion today and question if TEE necessary
   - cont Lovenox
   .
   ##Fever
 Her UA was negative, all other culture data is negative and
   no symptoms of infection.  Afebrile now for 24 hours.  possible source
   is her Melanoma itself.

   ## Hyponatremia/Concentrated Urine:  Suspect SIADH [**1-23**] lung mets.
   Appears euvolemic and sodium improved with fluid restriction.
   - 1.5L free water restriction.
   .
   ##. N/V: Pt endorsed nausea over the past 2 weeks which lead to her
   admission as well as emesis x 3 days. Pt also endorses 3 days of
   diarrhea. Given the concomittant emesis, diarrhea which has now
   resolved I suspect that this may be viral gastroenteritis. Her diarrhea
   has now resolved, she is tolerating cleasr. Her other work-up has
   included CT head which was negative for any masses. CT abd/pelvis was
   negative for any signs of intra-abdominal pathology such as ileus,
   extrinsic compression. Abdominal exam is benign.
   - ADAT
   - Continue home regimen of Reglan, Compazine, Zofran prn
   .
   ##. h.o.PE: Pt has history of P. Embolism even on Lovenox. Pt was
   previously on Coumadin for her A. fib however this appears to have been
   discontinued after her episodes of hemoptysis. Will continue on
   Lovenox, there is mention on admission note that she developed
   P.Embolism even with filter in place.
   - cont Lovenox 150 SC BID

   ##. Metastatic Melanoma: Pt has mets to the lung and is currently being
   followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 948**]. She is currently on Ipilimumab as part of
   the compassionate trial for Monotherapy in Subjects with
   Unresectable Stage III or IV Melanoma.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are identified:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 52-year-old female with metastatic melanoma to the lungs, currently undergoing treatment with Ipilimumab as part of a compassionate trial. She was admitted to the ICU for atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response and hypotension. The patient has a history of DVT/PE, and is currently on Lovenox. She has been experiencing nausea and vomiting, and has a possible diagnosis of SIADH due to hyponatremia and concentrated urine.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cardioversion:** The patient's atrial flutter is poorly controlled, and cardioversion is planned for the morning. There is a risk of complications during the procedure, such as arrhythmias, stroke, or cardiac arrest.
2. **SIADH:** The patient's hyponatremia and concentrated urine suggest SIADH, which can lead to seizures, coma, and even death if not treated promptly.
3. **Infection:** The patient's fever and neutropenia make her susceptible to infection. The presence of metastatic melanoma increases the risk of sepsis and multi-organ failure.
4. **DVT/PE:** The patient has a history of DVT/PE, and is currently on Lovenox. There is a risk of recurrent thromboembolic events, particularly with the presence of cancer.
5. **Gastrointestinal complications:** The patient's nausea and vomiting may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition.
6. **Cancer progression:** The patient's metastatic melanoma may continue to progress, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life.
7. **Cardiac complications:** The patient's atrial flutter and history of atrial fibrillation increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.

**Plan:**

1. Consult with the cardiology team for cardioversion and discuss the need for TEE.
2. Continue Lovenox to prevent DVT/PE.
3. Monitor the patient's sodium levels and adjust fluid restriction as necessary.
4. Manage nausea and vomiting with antiemetics and consider IV fluids.
5. Monitor for signs of infection and treat promptly if necessary.
6. Continue cancer treatment as planned, and discuss oncology recommendations with the patient's oncologist.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent cardiac complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y.o. Female with h.o. metastatic Melanoma to lungs on clinic trial,
   h.o. DVT/PE s/p IVC filter initially admitted for HA, n/v, poor PO
   intake. Transferred to the ICU for A. flutter with RVR w/ hypotension.
   .
   ##. A. flutter with RVR: Pt has history of SVT vs AVNRT vs A. flutter
   with RVR. Pt continues in constant flutter with rates poorly controlled
   on amio and dilt gtt. BP has been stable and pt asymptomatic. Has
   better chance of converting electrically. Will discuss cardioversion
   without TEE since presented in sinus and was on therapeutic dose
   Lovenox within 24 hours from admission.
   - attempt DC cardioversion today
   - cont Lovenox
   .
   ##Fever
 Her UA was negative, all other culture data is negative and
   no symptoms of infection.  Afebrile now for 24 hours.  possible source
   is her Melanoma itself.
   - LENI
s neg for DVT
   - discuss with onc CT abd/pelvis with contrast to look for mets.

   ## Hyponatremia/Concentrated Urine:  Suspect SIADH [**1-23**] lung mets.
   Appears euvolemic and sodium improved with fluid restriction.
   - 1.5L free water restriction.
   - if remains today, will give IVF to maintain this fluid goal
   .
   ##. N/V: Pt endorsed nausea over the past 2 weeks which lead to her
   admission as well as emesis x 3 days. Pt also endorses 3 days of
   diarrhea. Given the concomittant emesis, diarrhea which has now
   resolved I suspect that this may be viral gastroenteritis. Her diarrhea
   has now resolved, she is tolerating cleasr. Her other work-up has
   included CT head which was negative for any masses. CT abd/pelvis was
   negative for any signs of intra-abdominal pathology such as ileus,
   extrinsic compression. Abdominal exam is benign.
   - ADAT
   - Continue home regimen of Compazine, Zofran prn
   - add Reglan and Ativan prn
   .
   ##. h.o.PE: Pt has history of P. Embolism even on Lovenox. Pt was
   previously on Coumadin for her A. fib however this appears to have been
   discontinued after her episodes of hemoptysis. Will continue on
   Lovenox, there is mention on admission note that she developed
   P.Embolism even with filter in place.
   - cont Lovenox 150 SC BID

   ##. Metastatic Melanoma: Pt has mets to the lung and is currently being
   followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 948**]. She is currently on Ipilimumab as part of
   clinical trial.
   Unresectable Stage III or IV Melanoma.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 52-year-old female with metastatic melanoma to the lungs, was admitted to the ICU for atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response and hypotension. She has a history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, despite being on Lovenox. Her current medications include diltiazem, amiodarone, and enoxaparin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 129 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 115/54 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.1-8.8 K/μL
* Hemoglobin: 12.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 280 K/μL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 123-219 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium 154 mg/dL, potassium 4.1 mEq/L, magnesium 1.5 mg/dL, and phosphorus 2.1 mg/dL
* Albumin: 3.2 g/dL
* Calcium: 8.3 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General: obese Caucasian female lying down in bed
* HEENT: no scleral icterus, eyes move intact
* Cardiac: irregularly irregular rhythm, tachycardic, unable to appreciate murmurs
* Lungs: scattered wheezing noted over the left lower lobe
* Abdomen: obese, soft, non-tender, non-distended
* Extremities: no edema noted
* Neuro: alert and oriented, cranial nerves 2-12 grossly intact
* Psych: listens and responds to questions appropriately, pleasant

The patient's conditions and potential medical complications are:

1. Atrial Flutter with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's atrial flutter is poorly controlled on amiodarone and diltiazem, and cardioversion is planned.
2. Hyponatremia/Concentrated Urine: The patient has hyponatremia, and the possibility of SIADH is suspected due to lung metastases. Fluid restriction is planned.
3. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient has a history of nausea and vomiting, which may be related to viral gastroenteritis or her underlying melanoma.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis/Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a history of DVT and PE despite being on Lovenox, and Lovenox will be continued.
5. Metastatic Melanoma: The patient has unresectable stage III or IV melanoma, and is currently on Ipilimumab as part of a clinical trial.
6. Fever: The patient had a fever, but is now afebrile for 24 hours. The possibility of infection is low, and the source of the fever may be related to her underlying melanoma.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Attempt DC cardioversion today
* Continue Lovenox
* Fluid restriction for hyponatremia
* Continue home regimen of Compazine, Zofran, Reglan, and Ativan prn for nausea and vomiting
* Continue Lovenox 150 SC BID for DVT/PE
* Follow-up with oncologist for metastatic melanoma
* Disposition pending resolution of symptoms."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old female admitted to the ICU with atrial fibrillation (Afib), metastatic melanoma, and hyponatremia. She remains in Afib with a rapid ventricular rate despite being fully loaded with amiodarone. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 154 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/65 mmHg. She is receiving lovanox for anticoagulation and has a PICC line inserted. The patient is hesitant to eat due to mild nausea, and her hyponatremia is stable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Electrical cardioversion: The patient's Afib is refractory to treatment with amiodarone, and electrical cardioversion may be necessary to restore a normal heart rhythm.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of PE and is at risk for recurrent episodes due to her immobility and underlying cancer.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her indwelling lines and catheters, as well as her compromised immune system.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's nausea and vomiting may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in the setting of anticoagulation therapy.
5. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's Afib and rapid ventricular rate may increase the risk of cardiac tamponade, particularly if she develops a pericardial effusion.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she may be at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying lung disease and potential for pneumonia.
7. Renal failure: The patient's hyponatremia may be a sign of underlying kidney dysfunction, and she is at risk for further renal decline due to her underlying cancer and treatment.
8. Seizures: The patient's hyponatremia may lead to seizures, particularly if it is severe or untreated.
9. Stroke: The patient's Afib and rapid ventricular rate may increase the risk of stroke, particularly if she develops a thrombus in the left atrium or left ventricle.
10. Cardiac arrest: The patient's Afib and rapid ventricular rate may increase the risk of cardiac arrest, particularly if she develops a life-threatening arrhythmia or cardiac tamponade."

   tachycardia, unresponsive to a 1 liter fluid bolus.  Patient is not in
   pain, afebrile, and none of her cultures are positive, and CXR
s are
   negative.  Chest CT to evaluate for disease progression,
   post-obstructive PNA, atypical PNA.

   admission as well as emesis x 3 days. Pt also endorses 3 days of
   diarrhea. Given the concomittant emesis, diarrhea which has now
   resolved I suspect that this may be viral gastroenteritis. Her diarrhea
   has now resolved, she is tolerating cleasr. Her other work-up has
   included CT head which was negative for any masses. CT abd/pelvis was
   negative for any signs of intra-abdominal pathology such as ileus,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

* The patient is a 52-year-old female with metastatic melanoma to the lungs, admitted to the ICU for atrial flutter with right ventricular rupture (RVR) and hypotension.
* She underwent cardioversion with 100 joules and was successfully converted to sinus tachycardia.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 128 bpm, blood pressure of 135/92 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 93%.
* Her fluid balance is positive, with a total fluid input of 1631 mL and a total fluid output of 1735 mL.
* The patient has a history of nausea and vomiting, which has resolved, and is currently tolerating clear liquids.
* She has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and is currently on Lovenox for prophylaxis.
* The patient is on a clinical trial for metastatic melanoma and is receiving Ipilimumab.
* She has a history of atrial flutter and is currently on amiodarone.
* The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 290 K/uL.
* Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of hyponatremia, which is suspected to be due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).
* The patient's chest CT scan is negative for disease progression, post-obstructive pneumonia, and atypical pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Infection, particularly given the patient's history of DVT and PE, and the presence of a central line and urinary catheter.
* Fluid overload, given the patient's positive fluid balance and history of heart failure.
* Cardiac arrhythmias, particularly given the patient's history of atrial flutter and sinus tachycardia.
* Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure, given the patient's history of lung metastases and sinus tachycardia.
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as diarrhea or constipation, given the patient's history of nausea and vomiting.
* Thrombotic complications, such as DVT or PE, given the patient's history of these conditions and the presence of a central line and urinary catheter.

Based on this information, I recommend the following:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
* Maintain a high level of suspicion for infection and take prompt action to treat any suspected infections.
* Continue to manage the patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels carefully.
* Consider obtaining a chest CT scan to evaluate for disease progression and potential complications.
* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and consider adjusting her medication regimen as necessary.
* Consider obtaining a gastrointestinal workup to evaluate for potential gastrointestinal complications.
* Continue to monitor the patient's thrombotic risk and consider adjusting her anticoagulation regimen as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-inch tall individual with a temperature of 98.8°F (37.1°C), heart rate of 128 beats per minute, blood pressure of 135/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient underwent cardioversion today with 100 joules, which successfully converted the atrial fibrillation/flutter to sinus tachycardia. The patient has a history of iodine allergy and has received antibiotics, midazolam, and hydromorphone infusions.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the following:

* Flowsheet data indicates a 24-hour fluid balance of -104 mL, with a total input of 1,631 mL and a total output of 1,735 mL.
* The patient's blood products include 567 mL of IV fluid and 290 mL of urine output.
* The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery with a SpO2 of 93%.
* The patient's physical examination is limited due to the inability to assess peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.

Laboratory results include:

* White blood cell count: 8.1-11.8 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 34.6-35.7%
* Platelet count: 280-290 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8-0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 123-154 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results include CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, differential neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, eosinophil count, albumin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

* Hypovolemia due to the negative fluid balance and decreased urine output
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's tachypnea and decreased oxygen saturation
* Infection due to the patient's immunosuppressed state and the presence of a PICC line
* Cardiovascular complications due to the patient's tachycardia and the recent cardioversion procedure
* Gastrointestinal complications due to the patient's history of nausea and vomiting and the presence of a stress ulcer prophylaxis

It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings closely to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y.o. Female with h.o. metastatic Melanoma to lungs on clinic trial,
   h.o. DVT/PE s/p IVC filter initially admitted for HA, n/v, poor PO
   intake. Transferred to the ICU for A. flutter with RVR w/ hypotension.
   .
   ##. A. flutter with RVR: Pt has history of SVT vs AVNRT vs A. flutter
   with RVR. Patient cardioverted yesterday, successfully.  BP has been
   stable and pt asymptomatic.  Currently only on amiodarone.
   -Cont. Amiodarone
   .
   #Sinus Tachycardia: After Cardioversion patient has been in sinus
   tachycardia, unresponsive to a 1 liter fluid bolus.  Patient is not in
   pain, afebrile, and none of her cultures are positive, and CXR
s are
   negative
   - ? cytokine effect from underlying malignancy.
   .
   ##Fever
 Her UA was negative, all other culture data is negative and
   no symptoms of infection.  Afebrile now for 24 hours.  possible source
   is her Melanoma itself.
   - LENI
s neg for DVT
   - discuss with onc CT abd/pelvis with contrast to look for mets.
   .
   ## Hyponatremia/Concentrated Urine:  Suspect SIADH [**1-23**] lung mets.
   Appears euvolemic and sodium had improved with fluid restriction, and
   worsened with IVF bolus overnight
   - 1.5L free water restriction.
   .
   ##. N/V: Pt endorsed nausea over the past 2 weeks which lead to her
   admission as well as emesis x 3 days. Pt also endorses 3 days of
   diarrhea. Given the concomittant emesis, diarrhea which has now
   resolved I suspect that this may be viral gastroenteritis. Her diarrhea
   has now resolved, she is tolerating cleasr. Her other work-up has
   included CT head which was negative for any masses. CT abd/pelvis was
   negative for any signs of intra-abdominal pathology such as ileus,
   extrinsic compression. Abdominal exam is benign.
   - ADAT
   - Continue home regimen of Compazine, Zofran prn
   - add Reglan and Ativan prn
   .
   ##. h.o.PE: Pt has history of P. Embolism even on Lovenox. Pt was
   previously on Coumadin for her A. fib however this appears to have been
   discontinued after her episodes of hemoptysis. Will continue on
   Lovenox, there is mention on admission note that she developed
   P.Embolism even with filter in place.
   - cont Lovenox 150 SC BID
   .
   ##. Metastatic Melanoma: Pt has mets to the lung and is currently being
   followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 948**]. She is currently on Ipilimumab as part of
   clinical trial.
   Unresectable Stage III or IV Melanoma.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 948**]
s input greatly appreciated
   - f/u onc recs, if any
    .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 Her UA was negative, all other culture data is negative and
   no symptoms of infection.  Afebrile now for 24 hours.  possible source
   is her Melanoma itself.

   ##. N/V: Pt endorsed nausea over the past 2 weeks which lead to her
   admission as well as emesis x 3 days. Pt also endorses 3 days of
   diarrhea. Given the concomittant emesis, diarrhea which has now
   resolved I suspect that this may be viral gastroenteritis. Her diarrhea
   has now resolved, she is tolerating cleasr. Her other work-up has
   included CT head which was negative for any masses. CT abd/pelvis was
   negative for any signs of intra-abdominal pathology such as ileus,
   extrinsic compression. Abdominal exam is benign.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 52-year-old female with metastatic melanoma to the lungs, currently on a clinical trial with Ipilimumab. She was admitted to the ICU for atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response and hypotension, which was successfully cardioverted. She is currently on amiodarone for atrial flutter and has a history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cytokine effect:** The patient's sinus tachycardia may be related to a cytokine effect from her underlying malignancy.
2. **Fever:** The patient's fever may be related to her melanoma, and further evaluation with CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast is recommended.
3. **Hyponatremia and concentrated urine:** The patient's hyponatremia and concentrated urine may be related to SIADH, which could be caused by lung metastases.
4. **Nausea and vomiting:** The patient's nausea and vomiting may be related to viral gastroenteritis, and further evaluation with CT head and abdominal exam is recommended.
5. **Pulmonary embolism:** The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism, and further evaluation with CT pulmonary angiogram is recommended.
6. **Metastatic melanoma:** The patient's metastatic melanoma may progress, and further evaluation with CT scans and oncology consultation is recommended.
7. **Atrial flutter:** The patient's atrial flutter may recur, and further evaluation with Holter monitor and echocardiogram is recommended.
8. **Cardiovascular complications:** The patient's history of atrial flutter, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism increases her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest.

**Plan:**

1. Continue amiodarone for atrial flutter.
2. Monitor for signs of cytokine effect, fever, and hyponatremia.
3. Continue Lovenox for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
4. Discuss with oncologist about further evaluation with CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast and CT head.
5. Continue home regimen of Compazine, Zofran, Reglan, and Ativan for nausea and vomiting.
6. Monitor for signs of pulmonary embolism and consider further evaluation with CT pulmonary angiogram.
7. Monitor for signs of metastatic melanoma progression and consider further evaluation with CT scans and oncology consultation.
8. Consider further evaluation with Holter monitor and echocardiogram for atrial flutter."

   2. Findings most consistent with mild pulmonary edema, including new
   small bilateral pleural effusions, scattered areas of ground-glass
   opacity, and mild interlobular septal thickening.
   Assessment and Plan
   52 y.o. Female with h.o. metastatic Melanoma to lungs on clinic trial,
   h.o. DVT/PE s/p IVC filter initially admitted for HA, n/v, poor PO
   intake. Transferred to the ICU for A. flutter with RVR w/ hypotension.
   .
   ##. A. flutter with RVR: Pt has history of SVT vs AVNRT vs A. flutter
   with RVR. Patient cardioverted  successfully.  BP has been stable and
   pt asymptomatic.
   -Cont. Amiodarone (D3 at 400 mg TID)
   .
   #Sinus Tachycardia/leukocytosis: After Cardioversion patient has been
   in sinus tachycardia, unresponsive to a 1 liter fluid bolus.  Patient
   is not in pain, afebrile, and none of her cultures are positive, and
   CXR
s are negative.  Chest CT shows worsening malignancy but no PNA.
   - treat empirically for sinusitis with Levaquin (D2)
   - if no improvement, may atrribute to cytokine response from underlying
   malignancy
   .
   #. q/o hypopituitarism: Pt has low AM cortisol, with low TSH,
   concerning for pituitary process. Study drug for her melanoma can
   apparently cause hypopituitarism. PRL was normal. T4 was borderline
   low. IGF-1 pending.
   - discuss with onc
   ..
   ## Hyponatremia/Concentrated Urine:  Suspect SIADH [**1-23**] lung mets.
   Appears euvolemic and sodium had improved with fluid restriction, and
   worsened with IVF.
   - 1.5L free water restriction.
   .
   ##. N/V: Pt endorsed nausea over the past 2 weeks which lead to her
   admission as well as emesis x 3 days. Pt also endorses 3 days of
   diarrhea. Given the concomittant emesis, diarrhea which has now
   resolved I suspect that this may be viral gastroenteritis. Her diarrhea
   has now resolved, she is tolerating cleasr. Her other work-up has
   included CT head which was negative for any masses. CT abd/pelvis was
   negative for any signs of intra-abdominal pathology such as ileus,
   extrinsic compression. Abdominal exam is benign.
   - ADAT
   - Continue home regimen of Compazine, Zofran prn
   - add Reglan and Ativan prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with metastatic melanoma to the lungs, who is currently on a clinical trial with Ipilimumab. She was admitted to the ICU for atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response and hypotension, which was successfully cardioverted. She has a history of sinus tachycardia, leukocytosis, and hypopituitarism, which is being treated with medication. She also has hyponatremia, which is suspected to be due to SIADH caused by lung metastases. She has a history of nausea and vomiting, which is being treated with anti-emetic medication. She has a history of pulmonary embolism and is currently on Lovenox.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of hypopituitarism: The patient's low AM cortisol and low TSH levels suggest a pituitary process, which may worsen if not treated promptly.
2. Increased risk of bleeding: The patient's history of pulmonary embolism and current use of Lovenox may increase her risk of bleeding.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening lung metastases and mild pulmonary edema may lead to respiratory failure if not treated promptly.
4. Infections: The patient's immunocompromised state due to her underlying malignancy and current treatment may increase her risk of infections.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of nausea and vomiting may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as ileus or perforation if not treated promptly.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of atrial flutter and rapid ventricular response may lead to cardiovascular complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias if not treated promptly.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of leukocytosis and sinus tachycardia may lead to neurological complications such as seizures or encephalopathy if not treated promptly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y.o. Female with h.o. metastatic Melanoma to lungs on clinic trial,
   h.o. DVT/PE s/p IVC filter initially admitted for HA, n/v, poor PO
   intake. Transferred to the ICU for A. flutter with RVR w/ hypotension.

   #. q/o hypopituitarism: Pt has low AM cortisol, with low TSH,
   concerning for pituitary process. Study drug for her melanoma can
   apparently cause hypopituitarism. PRL was normal. T4 was borderline
   low. IGF-1 pending.
   - endocrine consult
   - discuss with onc
   .
   ##. A. flutter with RVR: Pt has history of SVT vs AVNRT vs A. flutter
   with RVR. Patient cardioverted  successfully.  BP has been stable and
   pt asymptomatic.
   -Cont. Amiodarone (D3 at 400 mg TID)
   .
   #Sinus Tachycardia/leukocytosis: After Cardioversion patient has been
   in sinus tachycardia, unresponsive to a 1 liter fluid bolus.  Patient
   is not in pain, afebrile, and none of her cultures are positive, and
   CXR
s are negative.  Chest CT shows worsening malignancy but no PNA.
   One possibility is cytokine release and inflammatory response from
   chemotherapy (since it enhances immune response in general in order to
   kill malignant cells)
   - treat empirically for sinusitis with Levaquin (D2/5)
   - if no improvement, may atrribute to cytokine response from underlying
   malignancy

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma to the lungs, currently on a clinic trial with study drug Ipilimumab. She has been admitted to the ICU for atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response and hypotension.

The patient has a low TSH and cortisol level, indicating hypopituitarism, and is being considered for an endocrine consult. She has also been experiencing sinus tachycardia and leukocytosis, which may be attributed to cytokine release and inflammatory response from chemotherapy.

Other medical issues include:

* Hyponatremia and concentrated urine, suspected to be caused by SIADH due to lung metastases
* Nausea and vomiting, initially attributed to viral gastroenteritis, but now appears to be related to anorexia
* History of pulmonary embolism, even with the presence of an IVC filter
* Metastatic melanoma with unresectable stage III or IV disease

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Hypopituitarism can lead to adrenal insufficiency, which can cause hypotension, tachycardia, and even death if not properly managed.
* Cytokine release syndrome can cause multi-organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiac, and renal failure.
* SIADH can lead to hyponatremia, which can cause seizures, coma, and even death if not treated promptly.
* Nausea and vomiting can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition.
* Pulmonary embolism can cause respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and even death.
* Metastatic melanoma can cause further organ dysfunction and failure, including liver, kidney, and brain involvement.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure the best possible outcomes."
