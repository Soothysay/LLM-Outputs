   Assessment and Plan
   /P:69 yo female with multiple medical problems including DM2, recent
   MRSA bacteremia, COPD s/p trach, CKD, originally admitted to the ICU
   with altered mental status found to have UTI, partial SBO and acute
   renal failure now being transferred back to the ICU for ventilator
   support
   .
   # Acute on chronic Respiratory Failure - s/p trach 03/[**2139**]. Was
   originally on face mask. Now more acedemic likely seconday to renal
   failure and not able to compensate. Also, not moving much air likley
   secondary to COPD exacerbation. CXR unchanged. She does not appear
   overtly volume overloaded despite being oliguric.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed.
   - Continue prednisone
   - Restart on vent with goal pH of 7.2, try on PS first
   - Hold on IVF at this point and reserve only for hypotension
   - d/c HCO3 and correct acid base disturbance with vent support
   - Monitor VBG
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-1.8 prior to last
   admission, however on last discharge Cr was 4.2 (felt to be her new
   baseline).  During that admission rise in creatinine was attributed to
   ATN.  She was also noted to have positive urine eos and cetazadime was
   discontinued.  Also noted to have renal mass on CT. Originally given
   IVF on admission with no improvement. Now with continued worsening
   renal function and acidemia (creatinine 7.0). Dialysis has been
   discussed but to felt to be needed urgently.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - conrrect acid-base disturbance with vent
   - d/c HCO3 for now
   - In speaking with the family today, the are still interested in
   dialysis
   - When stable, get renal U/S to r/o obstruction
   .
   # UTI: History of bad panresistant infections.  She had VRE (sensitive
   to linezolid) and cefepime resistant nonfermenter nonpseudomonas
   (sensitive to cipro) on urine culture dated [**6-29**].  Positive UA with mod
   leuk, pos nit.    Elevated WBC count, currently afebrile.  BP stable.
   Lactate within normal limits. Urine culture with enterobacter sensitive
   to meropenum
   - start meropenum for presumed UTI
   .
   # Altered mental status: On admission patient was somnolent but
   responding to commands.  According to team she is only slightly more
   somnolent than her prior baseline. Head CT negative for evidence of
   bleed. AMS likely due to infection given negative head CT. Now she does
   not follow commands, barely opens eyes to sternal rub.  Likely
   multifactorial including infection, renal failure. Consider status
   epillepticus, but less likely given does intermittently wake up and has
   other reasons for altered mental status.
   - Hold sedating medications including Fentanyl patch
   - Treat urinary tract infection
   - if no improvement, consider EEG
   .
   # Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan from outside
   hospital.  Seen by surgery in the ED - nonoperative candidate, NG tube
   placed.  Abdominal exam notable for distension, nontender, diminished
   BS, now soft with + BS
   - Serial abdominal exams, continue NGT
   - NPO as diet, IVF PRN
   - Need to address nutritional status with family as patient had
   declined tube feeds in the past
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Troponin of 1.51 on admission to ED in setting of increased
   creatinine.  Case discussed with cardiology who did not feel
   intervention necessary at this time.  At this point timing of event is
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 278**] echo on [**6-29**] showed EF 50-55%, repeat on [**7-22**] no new
   focal wall motion abnormalities, but suboptimal study.  Currently
   denies CP.
   - Continue beta blocker, aspirin
   .
   # Seizures:
   - Continue trileptal
   .
   #. Diabetes Mellitus:
   - FS QID, continue on RISS
   .
   #. Chronic diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue beta blocker at slightly decreased dose.  Titrate up as
   tolerated to home dose.
   - Monitor volume status
   .
   # Hypertension: Has been intermittently hypotensive.
   - Continue on BB first then diltiazem, hydralazine with holding
   parameters
   .
   #. Nutrition: As of last discharge the patient was currently tolerating
   minimal po intake with PMV. Speech and swallow cleared patient for
   taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of puress and ice chips
   whicle trach collar in place with cuff deflated and PMV in place.
   There was a family discussion and patient declined placement of Dobhoff
   or PEG tube. Now the patient's family is saying that they want her to
   get TFs and possibly a PEG tube.  This will need to be readdressed
   .
   # PPx: PPI, heparin subq, bowel regimen
   .
   # Code: A discussion was had the with patient's HCPs, her daughter and
   son.  We specifically said that she had refused dialysis and TFs on her
   previous admission when she was more awake, but her family
   (particularly her son) wants to ""do everything.""  We specifically
   addressed putting her on the ventilator, which we all agree would not
   cause her any discomfort given she already had a trach.  However, I
   explained that if her heart stopped, or she went into a non-perfusing
   heart rhythm, she would likely not survive this.  Her son wanted CPR
   despite my explanation that she would likely never become conscious and
   her organs would fail further, her daughter is undecided.  They will
   have a family discussion about this was we will readdress this, but I
   did express that I think CPR would not be indicated.  I also explained
   that this does not mean that we would not be aggressive with other
   aspects of her care including antibiotics, putting her on the
   ventilator and considering dialysis if it was deemed necessary by
   nephrology .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   to linezolid) and cefepime resistant nonfermenter nonpseudomonas
   (sensitive to cipro) on urine culture dated [**6-29**].  Positive UA with mod
   leuk, pos nit.    Elevated WBC count, currently afebrile.  BP stable.
   Lactate within normal limits. Urine culture with enterobacter sensitive
   to meropenum
   - start meropenum for presumed UTI
   .
   # Altered mental status: On admission patient was somnolent but
   responding to commands.  According to team she is only slightly more
   somnolent than her prior baseline. Head CT negative for evidence of
   bleed. AMS likely due to infection given negative head CT. Now she does
   not follow commands, barely opens eyes to sternal rub.  Likely
   multifactorial including infection, renal failure. Consider status
   epillepticus, but less likely given does intermittently wake up and has
   other reasons for altered mental status.
   - Hold sedating medications including Fentanyl patch
   - Treat urinary tract infection
   - if no improvement, consider EEG
   .
   # Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan from outside
   hospital.  Seen by surgery in the ED - nonoperative candidate, NG tube
   placed.  Abdominal exam notable for distension, nontender, diminished
   BS, now soft with + BS
   - Serial abdominal exams, continue NGT
   - NPO as diet, IVF PRN
   - Need to address nutritional status with family as patient had
   declined tube feeds in the past
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Troponin of 1.51 on admission to ED in setting of increased
   creatinine.  Case discussed with cardiology who did not feel
   intervention necessary at this time.  At this point timing of event is
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 278**] echo on [**6-29**] showed EF 50-55%, repeat on [**7-22**] no new
   focal wall motion abnormalities, but suboptimal study.  Currently
   denies CP.

   # Hypertension: Has been intermittently hypotensive.
   - Continue on BB first then diltiazem, hydralazine with holding

   #. Nutrition: As of last discharge the patient was currently tolerating
   minimal po intake with PMV. Speech and swallow cleared patient for
   taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of puress and ice chips
   whicle trach collar in place with cuff deflated and PMV in place.
   There was a family discussion and patient declined placement of Dobhoff
   or PEG tube. Now the patient's family is saying that they want her to
   get TFs and possibly a PEG tube.  This will need to be readdressed
   .
   # PPx: PPI, heparin subq, bowel regimen
   .
   # Code: A discussion was had the with patient's HCPs, her daughter and
   son.  We specifically said that she had refused dialysis and TFs on her
   previous admission when she was more awake, but her family
   (particularly her son) wants to ""do everything.""  We specifically
   addressed putting her on the ventilator, which we all agree would not
   cause her any discomfort given she already had a trach.  However, I
   explained that if her heart stopped, or she went into a non-perfusing
   heart rhythm, she would likely not survive this.  Her son wanted CPR
   despite my explanation that she would likely never become conscious and
   her organs would fail further, her daughter is undecided.  They will
   have a family discussion about this was we will readdress this, but I
   did express that I think CPR would not be indicated.  I also explained
   that this does not mean that we would not be aggressive with other
   aspects of her care including antibiotics, putting her on the
   ventilator and considering dialysis if it was deemed necessary by
   nephrology .

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute on chronic respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration of her respiratory status.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can worsen her acid-base imbalance and electrolyte disturbances.
3. UTI: The patient has a UTI, which can spread to other parts of her body and cause sepsis.
4. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status, fever, and tachycardia suggest that she may be developing sepsis.
5. NSTEMI: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating possible cardiac damage.
6. Seizures: The patient's history of seizures and current altered mental status suggest that she may be at risk for seizure activity.
7. Nutrition: The patient's poor oral intake and inability to tolerate food may lead to malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.
8. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, which can lead to further cardiovascular complications.
9. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension suggest that she may be at risk for cardiovascular instability.
10. Infection: The patient's positive urine culture and history of bad panresistant infections suggest that she may be at risk for further infections.

To address these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored and managed with the following interventions:

1. Ventilatory support: The patient should be placed on a ventilator to improve her respiratory status and prevent further respiratory failure.
2. Antibiotic therapy: The patient should receive appropriate antibiotic therapy to treat her UTI and prevent the spread of infection.
3. Renal replacement therapy: The patient may require dialysis to manage her acute renal failure and prevent further electrolyte imbalances.
4. Cardiovascular support: The patient should receive cardiovascular support, including beta blockers and vasopressors, to manage her hypertension and cardiovascular instability.
5. Seizure management: The patient should receive seizure management, including anticonvulsant therapy, to prevent and manage seizure activity.
6. Nutrition support: The patient should receive nutrition support, including total parenteral nutrition, to prevent malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.
7. Infection control: The patient should receive infection control measures, including proper hand hygiene and isolation precautions, to prevent the spread of infection.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her care plan as needed to prevent further complications and improve her outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   /P:69 yo female with multiple medical problems including DM2, recent
   MRSA bacteremia, COPD s/p trach, CKD, originally admitted to the ICU
   with altered mental status found to have UTI, partial SBO and acute
   renal failure now being transferred back to the ICU for ventilator
   support
   .
   # Acute on chronic Respiratory Failure - s/p trach 03/[**2139**]. Was
   originally on face mask. Now more acedemic likely seconday to renal
   failure and not able to compensate. Also, not moving much air likley
   secondary to COPD exacerbation. CXR unchanged. She does not appear
   overtly volume overloaded despite being oliguric.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed.
   - Continue prednisone  - 60mg daily
 plan for long taper
   - Restart on vent with goal pH of 7.2, no improvement with PSV will
   continue AS for now
   - Hold on IVF at this point and reserve only for hypotension
   - Continue po bicarb
   - Monitor VBG
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-1.8 prior to last
   admission, however on last discharge Cr was 4.2 (felt to be her new
   baseline).  During that admission rise in creatinine was attributed to
   ATN.  She was also noted to have positive urine eos and cetazadime was
   discontinued.  Also noted to have renal mass on CT. Originally given
   IVF on admission with no improvement. Now with continued worsening
   renal function and acidemia (creatinine 7.0). Dialysis has been
   discussed but to felt to be needed urgently.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - conrrect acid-base disturbance as much as possible with vent
   - d/c IV HCO3 for now
   - In speaking with the family today, the are still interested in
   dialysis
   .
   # UTI: History of bad panresistant infections.  She had VRE (sensitive
   to linezolid) and cefepime resistant nonfermenter nonpseudomonas

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   /P:69 yo female with multiple medical problems including DM2, recent
   MRSA bacteremia, COPD s/p trach, CKD, originally admitted to the ICU
   with altered mental status found to have UTI, partial SBO and acute
   renal failure now being transferred back to the ICU for ventilator
   support
   .
   # Acute on chronic Respiratory Failure - s/p trach 03/[**2139**]. Was
   originally on face mask. Now more acedemic likely seconday to renal
   failure and not able to compensate. Also, not moving much air likley
   secondary to COPD exacerbation. CXR unchanged. She does not appear
   overtly volume overloaded despite being oliguric.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed.
   - Continue prednisone  - 60mg daily
 plan for long taper
   - Restart on vent with goal pH of 7.2, no improvement with PSV will
   continue AS for now
   - Hold on IVF at this point and reserve only for hypotension
   - Continue po bicarb
   - Monitor VBG
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-1.8 prior to last
   admission, however on last discharge Cr was 4.2 (felt to be her new
   baseline).  During that admission rise in creatinine was attributed to
   ATN.  She was also noted to have positive urine eos and cetazadime was
   discontinued.  Also noted to have renal mass on CT. Originally given
   IVF on admission with no improvement. Now with continued worsening
   renal function and acidemia (creatinine 7.0). Dialysis has been
   discussed but to felt to be needed urgently.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - conrrect acid-base disturbance as much as possible with vent
   - d/c IV HCO3 for now
   - In speaking with the family today, the are still interested in
   dialysis
   .
   # UTI: History of bad panresistant infections.  She had VRE (sensitive
   to linezolid) and cefepime resistant nonfermenter nonpseudomonas
   (sensitive to cipro) on urine culture dated [**6-29**].  Positive UA with mod
   leuk, pos nit.    Elevated WBC count, currently afebrile.  BP stable.
   Lactate within normal limits. Urine culture with enterobacter sensitive
   to meropenum
   - continue meropenum for presumed UTI
   .
   # Altered mental status: On admission patient was somnolent but
   responding to commands.  According to team she is only slightly more
   somnolent than her prior baseline. Head CT negative for evidence of
   bleed. AMS likely due to infection given negative head CT. Now she does
   not follow commands, barely opens eyes to sternal rub.  Likely
   multifactorial including infection, renal failure. Consider status
   epillepticus, but less likely given does intermittently wake up and has
   other reasons for altered mental status.
   - Hold sedating medications including Fentanyl patch
   - Treat urinary tract infection
   - if no improvement, consider EEG
   .
   # Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan from outside
   hospital.  Seen by surgery in the ED - nonoperative candidate, NG tube
   placed.  Abdominal exam notable for distension, nontender, diminished
   BS, now soft with + BS
   - Serial abdominal exams, continue NGT
 clinically improving
   - NPO as diet, IVF PRN
   - Need to address nutritional status with family as patient had
   declined tube feeds in the past
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Troponin of 1.51 on admission to ED in setting of increased
   creatinine.  Case discussed with cardiology who did not feel
   intervention necessary at this time.  At this point timing of event is
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 278**] echo on [**6-29**] showed EF 50-55%, repeat on [**7-22**] no new
   focal wall motion abnormalities, but suboptimal study.  Currently
   denies CP.
   - Continue beta blocker, aspirin
   .
   # Seizures:
   - Continue trileptal
   .
   #. Diabetes Mellitus:
   - FS QID, continue on RISS
   .
   #. Chronic diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue beta blocker at slightly decreased dose.  Titrate up as
   tolerated to home dose.
   - Monitor volume status
   .
   # Hypertension: Has been intermittently hypotensive.
   - DC hydral and diltiazem for low BP
   - continue BB
   .
   #. Nutrition: As of last discharge the patient was currently tolerating
   minimal po intake with PMV. Speech and swallow cleared patient for
   taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of puress and ice chips
   whicle trach collar in place with cuff deflated and PMV in place.
   There was a family discussion and patient declined placement of Dobhoff
   or PEG tube. Now the patient's family is saying that they want her to
   get TFs and possibly a PEG tube.  This will need to be readdressed.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus type 2, recent MRSA bacteremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with tracheostomy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and partial small bowel obstruction (SBO). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with altered mental status, acute renal failure, and a urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: She has acute on chronic respiratory failure, with a partial SBO and COPD exacerbation, which may be contributing to her respiratory acidosis. She is being ventilated with a goal pH of 7.2, and her respiratory support is being adjusted accordingly.
* Renal: She has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 7.0 mg/dL. She has a history of CKD and a previous episode of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Dialysis has been discussed, but it is not urgently needed at this time.
* Neurological: She has altered mental status, which is likely multifactorial, including infection, renal failure, and possible status epilepticus. She is not following commands and has poor air exchange.
* Infectious: She has a UTI caused by Enterobacter, which is sensitive to meropenem. She has a history of bad pan-resistant infections, including VRE and cefepime-resistant nonfermenter nonpseudomonas.
* Cardiovascular: She has a history of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), with a troponin level of 1.51 on admission. She is being treated with beta blockers and aspirin.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis and partial SBO may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
* Sepsis: The patient's UTI and possible secondary infections may lead to sepsis, which can worsen her respiratory and cardiovascular status.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of NSTEMI and ongoing cardiovascular risk factors may lead to further cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
* Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and possible status epilepticus may worsen, leading to further neurological complications.
* Nutritional complications: The patient's partial SBO and possible malnutrition may lead to further nutritional complications, such as dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.

In terms of treatment, the patient is being managed with antibiotics, ventilation, and supportive care. Her family has been informed of her condition and is being involved in her care. A family meeting has been planned to discuss her goals of care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with chronic respiratory and renal failure who was admitted to the ICU with worsening mental status and respiratory distress. He has been placed on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various medications, including steroids and nebulizers for COPD, and antibiotics for enterobacter. The patient's vital signs are stable, but his respiratory status remains critical. He is also experiencing acidosis and acute on chronic renal failure, which is being managed with bicarbonate therapy. The patient's nutritional needs are being assessed, and his blood glucose levels are being monitored. He has a history of hypertension, and his code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, and he is at risk for further deterioration. He may require more aggressive respiratory support, such as increased oxygen therapy or non-invasive ventilation.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's acidosis and acute on chronic renal failure may be contributing to pulmonary edema, which could worsen his respiratory status.
3. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and UTI may indicate the presence of sepsis, which could worsen his condition and increase his risk of complications.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may worsen, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and uremia.
5. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension may contribute to his current condition, and he may require more aggressive blood pressure control to prevent further complications.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's poor nutritional status may worsen his condition, particularly if he is unable to receive adequate nutrition through enteral feeding.
7. Infection: The patient's presence of UTI and enterobacter may indicate the presence of other infections, which could worsen his condition and increase his risk of complications.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of hypertension and chronic renal failure may increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and arrhythmias.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   P:69 yo female with multiple medical problems including DM2, recent
   MRSA bacteremia, COPD s/p trach, CKD, originally admitted to the ICU
   with altered mental status found to have UTI, partial SBO and acute
   renal failure now being transferred back to the ICU for ventilator
   support
   .
   # Acute on chronic Respiratory Failure - s/p trach 03/[**2139**]. Was
   originally on face mask. Now more acedemic likely seconday to renal
   failure and not able to compensate. Also, not moving much air likley
   secondary to COPD exacerbation. CXR unchanged. She does not appear
   overtly volume overloaded despite being oliguric.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed.
   - Continue prednisone  - 60mg daily
 plan for long taper
   - Restart on vent with goal pH of 7.2, no improvement with PSV will
   continue AS for now
   - Hold on IVF at this point and reserve only for hypotension
   - Continue po bicarb
   - Monitor VBG
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-1.8 prior to last
   admission, however on last discharge Cr was 4.2 (felt to be her new
   baseline).  During that admission rise in creatinine was attributed to
   ATN.  She was also noted to have positive urine eos and cetazadime was
   discontinued.  Also noted to have renal mass on CT. Originally given
   IVF on admission with no improvement. Now with continued worsening
   renal function and acidemia (creatinine 7.0). Dialysis has been
   discussed but to felt to be needed urgently.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - conrrect acid-base disturbance as much as possible with vent
   - d/c IV HCO3 for now
   - In speaking with the family today, the are still interested in
   dialysis
   .
   # UTI: History of bad panresistant infections.  She had VRE (sensitive
   to linezolid) and cefepime resistant nonfermenter nonpseudomonas
   (sensitive to cipro) on urine culture dated [**6-29**].  Positive UA with mod
   leuk, pos nit.    Elevated WBC count, currently afebrile.  BP stable.
   Lactate within normal limits. Urine culture with enterobacter sensitive
   to meropenum
   - continue meropenum for presumed UTI
   .
   # Altered mental status: On admission patient was somnolent but
   responding to commands.  According to team she is only slightly more
   somnolent than her prior baseline. Head CT negative for evidence of
   bleed. AMS likely due to infection given negative head CT. Now she does
   not follow commands, barely opens eyes to sternal rub.  Likely
   multifactorial including infection, renal failure. Consider status
   epillepticus, but less likely given does intermittently wake up and has
   other reasons for altered mental status.
   - Hold sedating medications including Fentanyl patch
   - Treat urinary tract infection
   - if no improvement, consider EEG
   .
   # Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan from outside
   hospital.  Seen by surgery in the ED - nonoperative candidate, NG tube
   placed.  Abdominal exam notable for distension, nontender, diminished
   BS, now soft with + BS
   - Serial abdominal exams, continue NGT
 clinically improving
   - NPO as diet, IVF PRN
   - Need to address nutritional status with family as patient had
   declined tube feeds in the past
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Troponin of 1.51 on admission to ED in setting of increased
   creatinine.  Case discussed with cardiology who did not feel
   intervention necessary at this time.  At this point timing of event is
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 278**] echo on [**6-29**] showed EF 50-55%, repeat on [**7-22**] no new
   focal wall motion abnormalities, but suboptimal study.  Currently
   denies CP.
   - Continue beta blocker, aspirin
   .
   # Seizures:
   - Continue trileptal
   .
   #. Diabetes Mellitus:
   - FS QID, continue on RISS
   .
   #. Chronic diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue beta blocker at slightly decreased dose.  Titrate up as
   tolerated to home dose.
   - Monitor volume status
   .
   # Hypertension: Has been intermittently hypotensive.
   - DC hydral and diltiazem for low BP
   - continue BB
   .
   #. Nutrition: As of last discharge the patient was currently tolerating
   minimal po intake with PMV. Speech and swallow cleared patient for
   taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of puress and ice chips
   whicle trach collar in place with cuff deflated and PMV in place.
   There was a family discussion and patient declined placement of Dobhoff
   or PEG tube. Now the patient's family is saying that they want her to
   get TFs and possibly a PEG tube.  This will need to be readdressed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

              (Reference Range-Negative).
   Assessment and Plan
   P:69 yo female with multiple medical problems including DM2, recent
   MRSA bacteremia, COPD s/p trach, CKD, originally admitted to the ICU
   with altered mental status found to have UTI, partial SBO and acute
   renal failure now being transferred back to the ICU for ventilator
   support
   .
   # Acute on chronic Respiratory Failure - s/p trach 03/[**2139**]. Was
   originally on face mask. Now more acedemic likely seconday to renal
   failure and not able to compensate. Also, not moving much air likley
   secondary to COPD exacerbation. CXR unchanged. She does not appear
   overtly volume overloaded despite being oliguric.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed.
   - Continue prednisone  - 60mg daily
 plan for long taper
   - Restart on vent with goal pH of 7.2, no improvement with PSV will
   continue AS for now
   - Hold on IVF at this point and reserve only for hypotension
   - Continue po bicarb
   - Monitor VBG
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-1.8 prior to last
   admission, however on last discharge Cr was 4.2 (felt to be her new
   baseline).  During that admission rise in creatinine was attributed to
   ATN.  She was also noted to have positive urine eos and cetazadime was
   discontinued.  Also noted to have renal mass on CT. Originally given
   IVF on admission with no improvement. Now with continued worsening
   renal function and acidemia (creatinine 7.0). Dialysis has been
   discussed but to felt to be needed urgently.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - conrrect acid-base disturbance as much as possible with vent
   - d/c IV HCO3 for now
   - In speaking with the family today, the are still interested in
   dialysis
   .
   # UTI: History of bad panresistant infections.  She had VRE (sensitive
   to linezolid) and cefepime resistant nonfermenter nonpseudomonas
   (sensitive to cipro) on urine culture dated [**6-29**].  Positive UA with mod
   leuk, pos nit.    Elevated WBC count, currently afebrile.  BP stable.
   Lactate within normal limits. Urine culture with enterobacter sensitive
   to meropenum
   - continue meropenum for presumed UTI
   .
   # Altered mental status: On admission patient was somnolent but
   responding to commands.  According to team she is only slightly more
   somnolent than her prior baseline. Head CT negative for evidence of
   bleed. AMS likely due to infection given negative head CT. Now she does
   not follow commands, barely opens eyes to sternal rub.  Likely
   multifactorial including infection, renal failure. Consider status
   epillepticus, but less likely given does intermittently wake up and has
   other reasons for altered mental status.
   - Hold sedating medications including Fentanyl patch
   - Treat urinary tract infection
   - if no improvement, consider EEG
   .
   # Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan from outside
   hospital.  Seen by surgery in the ED - nonoperative candidate, NG tube
   placed.  Abdominal exam notable for distension, nontender, diminished
   BS, now soft with + BS
   - Serial abdominal exams, continue NGT
 clinically improving
   - NPO as diet, IVF PRN
   - Need to address nutritional status with family as patient had
   declined tube feeds in the past
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Troponin of 1.51 on admission to ED in setting of increased
   creatinine.  Case discussed with cardiology who did not feel
   intervention necessary at this time.  At this point timing of event is
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 278**] echo on [**6-29**] showed EF 50-55%, repeat on [**7-22**] no new
   focal wall motion abnormalities, but suboptimal study.  Currently
   denies CP.
   - Continue beta blocker, aspirin
   .
   # Seizures:
   - Continue trileptal
   .
   #. Diabetes Mellitus:
   - FS QID, continue on RISS
   .
   #. Chronic diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue beta blocker at slightly decreased dose.  Titrate up as
   tolerated to home dose.
   - Monitor volume status
   .
   # Hypertension: Has been intermittently hypotensive.
   - DC hydral and diltiazem for low BP
   - continue BB
   .
   #. Nutrition: As of last discharge the patient was currently tolerating
   minimal po intake with PMV. Speech and swallow cleared patient for
   taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of puress and ice chips
   whicle trach collar in place with cuff deflated and PMV in place.
   There was a family discussion and patient declined placement of Dobhoff
   or PEG tube. Now the patient's family is saying that they want her to
   get TFs and possibly a PEG tube.  This will need to be readdressed.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

* The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus type 2, recent MRSA bacteremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a history of bad pan-resistant infections.
* She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, urinary tract infection (UTI), partial small bowel obstruction (SBO), and acute renal failure (ARF).
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 138/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
* The patient's laboratory results show:
	+ Elevated white blood cell count (12.0 K/uL)
	+ Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (63 mg/dL)
	+ Elevated creatinine (7.0 mg/dL)
	+ Elevated troponin-T (1.42 ng/mL)
	+ Elevated lactate (0.7 mmol/L)
	+ Abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) with left bundle branch block (LBBB)
* The patient's imaging studies show:
	+ Renal ultrasound: multiple small cysts in both kidneys, no hydronephrosis, stones, or solid renal mass
	+ Chest X-ray: no significant change since the prior study, no pneumonia or failure
* The patient's medical plan includes:
	+ Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed
	+ Continue prednisone 60mg daily
	+ Restart on vent with goal pH of 7.2
	+ Hold on IVF at this point and reserve only for hypotension
	+ Continue po bicarb
	+ Monitor VBG
	+ Repeat CXR in AM
	+ Continue meropenum for presumed UTI
	+ Hold sedating medications including Fentanyl patch
	+ Treat urinary tract infection
	+ Consider EEG if no improvement
	+ Serial abdominal exams, continue NGT
	+ NPO as diet, IVF PRN
	+ Need to address nutritional status with family
* The patient's family meeting is planned to discuss goals of care.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Worsening of ARF: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she is oliguric, which increases the risk of worsening ARF.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and she is on ventilatory support, which increases the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a history of bad pan-resistant infections and is currently being treated for UTI, which increases the risk of sepsis.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of NSTEMI and is taking beta blockers, which increases the risk of cardiac complications.
5. Neurological complications: The patient has altered mental status, which increases the risk of neurological complications such as seizures or status epilepticus.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of SBO and is currently being treated with NGT, which increases the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
7. Infections: The patient has a history of bad pan-resistant infections and is currently being treated for UTI, which increases the risk of infections such as pneumonia or bloodstream infections.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is on a diet of minimal PO intake with PMV, which increases the risk of nutritional deficiencies.

These are just a few of the potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition. A thorough evaluation and management plan should be developed to address these risks and prevent or minimize their occurrence."

   Assessment and Plan
   P:69 yo female with multiple medical problems including DM2, recent
   MRSA bacteremia, COPD s/p trach, CKD, originally admitted to the ICU
   with altered mental status found to have UTI, partial SBO and acute
   renal failure now being transferred back to the ICU with acute on
   chronic multiorgan system failure.
   .
   # Altered mental status: On admission patient was somnolent but
   responding to commands.  According to team she is only slightly more
   somnolent than her prior baseline. Head CT negative for evidence of
   bleed. Likely multifactorial including infection, renal failure, poor
   nutrition.
   - Hold sedating medications including Fentanyl patch
   - Treat urinary tract infection
   - Address nutritional status with family re desire for feeding tube
   .
   # Acute on chronic Respiratory Failure - s/p trach 03/[**2139**]. Was
   originally on face mask. Now more acedemic likely seconday to renal
   failure and not able to compensate. Also, not moving much air likley
   secondary to COPD exacerbation. CXR unchanged. She does not appear
   overtly volume overloaded despite being oliguric.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed.
   - Continue prednisone  - 60mg daily
 plan for long taper
   - Restart on vent with goal pH of 7.2, no improvement with PSV will
   continue AS for now
   - Hold on IVF at this point and reserve only for hypotension
   - Continue po bicarb
   - Monitor VBG
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt with progressive worsening of renal failure
   Cr now 7.5. Likely related to ATN during previous episodes of
   hypotension also recurrent UTIs, possible prior AIN. Dialysis has been
   discussed but to felt to be needed urgently.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
 discuss future HD with family
 felt it
   will like not alter long-term outcome given multiorgan system failure
   - conrrect acid-base disturbance as much as possible with vent
   - renal US negative for obstruction
   .
   # UTI: History of bad panresistant infections.  Urine culture with
   enterobacter sensitive to meropenum
   - continue meropenum for UTI
   .
   # Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan from outside
   hospital.  Seen by surgery in the ED - nonoperative candidate, NG tube
   placed.  Abdominal exam notable for distension, nontender, diminished
   BS, now soft with + BS
   - Serial abdominal exams, continue NGT
 clinically improving
   - NPO as diet, IVF PRN
   - Need to address nutritional status with family as patient had
   declined tube feeds in the past
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Troponin of 1.51 on admission to ED in setting of increased
   creatinine.  Case discussed with cardiology who did not feel
   intervention necessary at this time.  At this point timing of event is
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 278**] echo on [**6-29**] showed EF 50-55%, repeat on [**7-22**] no new
   focal wall motion abnormalities, but suboptimal study.  Pt with
   increasing ectopy on telemetry
 rate related LBBB. Troponins trending
   down overall from admission
   - Continue beta blocker, aspirin
   .
   # Seizures:
   - Continue trileptal
   .
   #. Diabetes Mellitus:
   - FS QID, continue on RISS
   .
   #. Chronic diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue beta blocker at slightly decreased dose.
   - Monitor volume status
   .
   # Hypertension: Has been intermittently hypotensive.
   - DC hydral and diltiazem for low BP
   - continue BB
   .
   #. Nutrition: As of last discharge the patient was currently tolerating
   minimal po intake with PMV. Speech and swallow cleared patient for
   taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of puress and ice chips
   whicle trach collar in place with cuff deflated and PMV in place.
   There was a family discussion and patient declined placement of Dobhoff
   or PEG tube. Will hold on TF for now per discussion with family.
   .
   # PPx: PPI, bowel regimen
   .
   # Code: DNR
 family meeting held on [**7-27**]. Cardiac resuscitation not
   medically indicated given pt
s multiorgan system failure. Family
   agreeable to change in code status
   .
   # Goals of care
 family meeting held today. Family members will
   consider transitioning to goals of comfort given pt
s overall poor
   prognosis. Will continue aggressive medical regimen but hold on any
   procedures that may cause pt discomfort. No acute indication for HD,
   family will continue to discuss possibility of future HD.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, acute renal failure, and a urinary tract infection (UTI). She was treated with antibiotics and other medications, but her condition has deteriorated, and she is now experiencing acute on chronic multiorgan system failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 138/76 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. Her cardiac status is stable, with a sinus rhythm and a troponin level of 1.42 ng/mL.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and lactate, indicating acute kidney injury. Her urine output is decreased, and she is oliguric. Her electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia.

The patient's imaging studies show no evidence of hydronephrosis or stones, but multiple small cysts are present in both kidneys. Her chest x-ray shows no pneumonia or failure, but her heart is somewhat enlarged.

The patient's medical history includes a recent episode of MRSA bacteremia, which was treated with antibiotics. She also has a history of bad panresistant infections and has declined tube feeds in the past.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing antibiotics for the UTI, addressing her nutritional status with family, and monitoring her respiratory and cardiac status. She will also be evaluated for potential dialysis and other treatments.

Potential medical complications:

1. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and her urine output is decreased, indicating acute kidney injury. This could lead to further deterioration in her renal function and potentially require dialysis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and her oxygen saturation is decreased, indicating respiratory failure. This could lead to further deterioration in her respiratory status and potentially require mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac failure: The patient's troponin level is elevated, indicating cardiac injury. This could lead to further deterioration in her cardiac status and potentially require cardiology consultation.
4. Sepsis: The patient's UTI could lead to sepsis, which could further deteriorate her multiorgan system failure.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's poor nutritional status could lead to further deterioration in her overall health and potentially require enteral or parenteral nutrition.
6. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility could lead to pressure ulcers, which could further deteriorate her overall health and potentially require surgical intervention.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for the UTI and monitor the patient's response.
2. Address the patient's nutritional status with family and consider enteral or parenteral nutrition if necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory and cardiac status and consider mechanical ventilation or cardiology consultation if necessary.
4. Evaluate the patient for potential dialysis and other treatments.
5. Consider enteral or parenteral nutrition to prevent malnutrition and potential pressure ulcers.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medications as necessary to prevent further complications."

      CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2139-7-27**]):
         FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
              (Reference Range-Negative).
   Assessment and Plan
   P:69 yo female with multiple medical problems including DM2, recent
   MRSA bacteremia, COPD s/p trach, CKD, originally admitted to the ICU
   with altered mental status found to have UTI, partial SBO and acute
   renal failure now being transferred back to the ICU with acute on
   chronic multiorgan system failure.
   .
   # Altered mental status: On admission patient was somnolent but
   responding to commands.  According to team she is only slightly more
   somnolent than her prior baseline. Head CT negative for evidence of
   bleed. Likely multifactorial including infection, renal failure, poor
   nutrition.
   - Hold sedating medications including Fentanyl patch
   - Treat urinary tract infection
   - Address nutritional status with family re desire for feeding tube
   .
   # Acute on chronic Respiratory Failure - s/p trach 03/[**2139**]. Was
   originally on face mask. Now more acedemic likely seconday to renal
   failure and not able to compensate. Also, not moving much air likley
   secondary to COPD exacerbation. CXR unchanged. She does not appear
   overtly volume overloaded despite being oliguric.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed.
   - Continue prednisone  - 60mg daily
 plan for long taper
   - Restart on vent with goal pH of 7.2, no improvement with PSV will
   continue AS for now
   - Hold on IVF at this point and reserve only for hypotension
   - Continue po bicarb
   - Monitor VBG
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt with progressive worsening of renal failure
   Cr now 7.5. Likely related to ATN during previous episodes of
   hypotension also recurrent UTIs, possible prior AIN. Dialysis has been
   discussed but to felt to be needed urgently.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
 discuss future HD with family
 felt it
   will like not alter long-term outcome given multiorgan system failure
   - conrrect acid-base disturbance as much as possible with vent
   - renal US negative for obstruction
   .
   # UTI: History of bad panresistant infections.  Urine culture with
   enterobacter sensitive to meropenum
   - continue meropenum for UTI
   .
   # Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan from outside
   hospital.  Seen by surgery in the ED - nonoperative candidate, NG tube
   placed.  Abdominal exam notable for distension, nontender, diminished
   BS, now soft with + BS
   - Serial abdominal exams, continue NGT
 clinically improving
   - NPO as diet, IVF PRN
   - Need to address nutritional status with family as patient had
   declined tube feeds in the past
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Troponin of 1.51 on admission to ED in setting of increased
   creatinine.  Case discussed with cardiology who did not feel
   intervention necessary at this time.  At this point timing of event is
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 278**] echo on [**6-29**] showed EF 50-55%, repeat on [**7-22**] no new
   focal wall motion abnormalities, but suboptimal study.  Currently
   denies CP.
   - Continue beta blocker, aspirin
   .
   # Seizures:
   - Continue trileptal
   .
   #. Diabetes Mellitus:
   - FS QID, continue on RISS
   .
   #. Chronic diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue beta blocker at slightly decreased dose.  Titrate up as
   tolerated to home dose.
   - Monitor volume status
   .
   # Hypertension: Has been intermittently hypotensive.
   - DC hydral and diltiazem for low BP
   - continue BB
   .
   #. Nutrition: As of last discharge the patient was currently tolerating
   minimal po intake with PMV. Speech and swallow cleared patient for
   taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of puress and ice chips
   whicle trach collar in place with cuff deflated and PMV in place.
   There was a family discussion and patient declined placement of Dobhoff
   or PEG tube. Now the patient's family is saying that they want her to
   get TFs and possibly a PEG tube.  This will need to be readdressed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

* The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus type 2, recent MRSA bacteremia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with tracheostomy.
* The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute on chronic multiorgan system failure, including acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, and sepsis.
* The patient has a new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on electrocardiogram (ECG) and has been diagnosed with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
* The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is being treated with meropenem.
* The patient has a partial small bowel obstruction (SBO) and is being managed with a nasogastric tube (NGT) and IV fluids as needed.
* The patient's neurological status is altered, and she is unable to provide a history due to encephalopathy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Worsening of acute renal failure, potentially requiring dialysis.
2. Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Progression of sepsis, potentially leading to septic shock.
4. Complications related to the patient's diabetes mellitus, such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
5. Cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
6. Gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or bowel perforation.
7. Neurological complications, such as increased intracranial pressure or cerebral edema.
8. Infection-related complications, such as bacteremia or sepsis.

The patient's family is planning to discuss goals of care and code status, and a full code has been assigned. The patient's disposition is currently ICU care."

   Assessment and Plan
   P:69 yo female with multiple medical problems including DM2, recent
   MRSA bacteremia, COPD s/p trach, CKD, originally admitted to the ICU
   with altered mental status found to have UTI, partial SBO and acute
   renal failure now being transferred back to the ICU for ventilator
   support
   .
   # Acute on chronic Respiratory Failure - s/p trach 03/[**2139**]. Was
   originally on face mask. Now more acedemic likely seconday to renal
   failure and not able to compensate. Also, not moving much air likley
   secondary to COPD exacerbation. CXR unchanged. She does not appear
   overtly volume overloaded despite being oliguric.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed.
   - Continue prednisone  - 60mg daily
 plan for long taper
   - Restart on vent with goal pH of 7.2, no improvement with PSV will
   continue AS for now
   - Hold on IVF at this point and reserve only for hypotension
   - Continue po bicarb
   - Monitor VBG
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-1.8 prior to last
   admission, however on last discharge Cr was 4.2 (felt to be her new
   baseline).  During that admission rise in creatinine was attributed to
   ATN.  She was also noted to have positive urine eos and cetazadime was
   discontinued.  Also noted to have renal mass on CT. Originally given
   IVF on admission with no improvement. Now with continued worsening
   renal function and acidemia (creatinine 7.0). Dialysis has been
   discussed but to felt to be needed urgently.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - conrrect acid-base disturbance as much as possible with vent
   - d/c IV HCO3 for now
   - In speaking with the family today, the are still interested in
   dialysis
   .
   # UTI: History of bad panresistant infections.  She had VRE (sensitive
   to linezolid) and cefepime resistant nonfermenter nonpseudomonas
   (sensitive to cipro) on urine culture dated [**6-29**].  Positive UA with mod
   leuk, pos nit.    Elevated WBC count, currently afebrile.  BP stable.
   Lactate within normal limits. Urine culture with enterobacter sensitive
   to meropenum
   - continue meropenum for presumed UTI
   .
   # Altered mental status: On admission patient was somnolent but
   responding to commands.  According to team she is only slightly more
   somnolent than her prior baseline. Head CT negative for evidence of
   bleed. AMS likely due to infection given negative head CT. Now she does
   not follow commands, barely opens eyes to sternal rub.  Likely
   multifactorial including infection, renal failure. Consider status
   epillepticus, but less likely given does intermittently wake up and has
   other reasons for altered mental status.
   - Hold sedating medications including Fentanyl patch
   - Treat urinary tract infection
   - if no improvement, consider EEG
   .
   # Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan from outside
   hospital.  Seen by surgery in the ED - nonoperative candidate, NG tube
   placed.  Abdominal exam notable for distension, nontender, diminished
   BS, now soft with + BS
   - Serial abdominal exams, continue NGT
 clinically improving
   - NPO as diet, IVF PRN
   - Need to address nutritional status with family as patient had

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   P:69 yo female with multiple medical problems including DM2, recent
   MRSA bacteremia, COPD s/p trach, CKD, originally admitted to the ICU
   with altered mental status found to have UTI, partial SBO and acute
   renal failure now being transferred back to the ICU for ventilator
   support
   .
   # Acute on chronic Respiratory Failure - s/p trach 03/[**2139**]. Was
   originally on face mask. Now more acedemic likely seconday to renal
   failure and not able to compensate. Also, not moving much air likley
   secondary to COPD exacerbation. CXR unchanged. She does not appear
   overtly volume overloaded despite being oliguric.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed.
   - Continue prednisone  - 60mg daily
 plan for long taper
   - Restart on vent with goal pH of 7.2, no improvement with PSV will
   continue AS for now
   - Hold on IVF at this point and reserve only for hypotension
   - Continue po bicarb
   - Monitor VBG
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-1.8 prior to last
   admission, however on last discharge Cr was 4.2 (felt to be her new
   baseline).  During that admission rise in creatinine was attributed to
   ATN.  She was also noted to have positive urine eos and cetazadime was
   discontinued.  Also noted to have renal mass on CT. Originally given
   IVF on admission with no improvement. Now with continued worsening
   renal function and acidemia (creatinine 7.0). Dialysis has been
   discussed but to felt to be needed urgently.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - conrrect acid-base disturbance as much as possible with vent
   - d/c IV HCO3 for now
   - In speaking with the family today, the are still interested in
   dialysis
   .
   # UTI: History of bad panresistant infections.  She had VRE (sensitive
   to linezolid) and cefepime resistant nonfermenter nonpseudomonas
   (sensitive to cipro) on urine culture dated [**6-29**].  Positive UA with mod
   leuk, pos nit.    Elevated WBC count, currently afebrile.  BP stable.
   Lactate within normal limits. Urine culture with enterobacter sensitive
   to meropenum
   - continue meropenum for presumed UTI
   .
   # Altered mental status: On admission patient was somnolent but
   responding to commands.  According to team she is only slightly more
   somnolent than her prior baseline. Head CT negative for evidence of
   bleed. AMS likely due to infection given negative head CT. Now she does
   not follow commands, barely opens eyes to sternal rub.  Likely
   multifactorial including infection, renal failure. Consider status
   epillepticus, but less likely given does intermittently wake up and has
   other reasons for altered mental status.
   - Hold sedating medications including Fentanyl patch
   - Treat urinary tract infection
   - if no improvement, consider EEG
   .
   # Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan from outside
   hospital.  Seen by surgery in the ED - nonoperative candidate, NG tube
   placed.  Abdominal exam notable for distension, nontender, diminished
   BS, now soft with + BS
   - Serial abdominal exams, continue NGT
 clinically improving
   - NPO as diet, IVF PRN
   - Need to address nutritional status with family as patient had
   declined tube feeds in the past
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Troponin of 1.51 on admission to ED in setting of increased
   creatinine.  Case discussed with cardiology who did not feel
   intervention necessary at this time.  At this point timing of event is
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 278**] echo on [**6-29**] showed EF 50-55%, repeat on [**7-22**] no new
   focal wall motion abnormalities, but suboptimal study.  Currently
   denies CP.
   - Continue beta blocker, aspirin
   .
   # Seizures:
   - Continue trileptal
   .
   #. Diabetes Mellitus:
   - FS QID, continue on RISS
   .
   #. Chronic diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue beta blocker at slightly decreased dose.  Titrate up as
   tolerated to home dose.
   - Monitor volume status
   .
   # Hypertension: Has been intermittently hypotensive.
   - DC hydral and diltiazem for low BP
   - continue BB
   .
   #. Nutrition: As of last discharge the patient was currently tolerating
   minimal po intake with PMV. Speech and swallow cleared patient for
   taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of puress and ice chips
   whicle trach collar in place with cuff deflated and PMV in place.
   There was a family discussion and patient declined placement of Dobhoff
   or PEG tube. Now the patient's family is saying that they want her to
   get TFs and possibly a PEG tube.  This will need to be readdressed.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following medical complications and potential issues are identified:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute on chronic respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to renal failure and COPD exacerbation. The patient requires ventilator support and has a goal pH of 7.2.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has worsening renal function, with a creatinine level of 7.0, and is at risk for dialysis. The patient's electrolytes are also abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L and a phosphorus level of 6.6 mg/dL.
3. UTI: The patient has a positive urine culture with enterobacter sensitive to meropenum, and is being treated with meropenum.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which is likely multifactorial, including infection, renal failure, and potential status epilepticus. The patient is not following commands and has a poor response to stimuli.
5. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient has a partial small bowel obstruction, which is clinically improving with serial abdominal exams and a nasogastric tube.
6. NSTEMI: The patient has a history of NSTEMI, with a troponin level of 1.51 on admission, and is being treated with beta blockers and aspirin.
7. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures, which are being managed with trileptal.
8. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has diabetes mellitus, which is being managed with FS QID and RISS.
9. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has chronic diastolic heart failure, which is being managed with beta blockers and monitoring of volume status.
10. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with beta blockers and hydral and diltiazem.

Potential issues and complications that may arise include:

1. Progressive respiratory failure, requiring increased ventilator support or consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Worsening renal failure, potentially requiring dialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
3. Development of sepsis or septic shock, particularly given the patient's history of bad panresistant infections.
4. Continued altered mental status, potentially requiring further evaluation with an EEG or consideration of status epilepticus.
5. Complications related to the small bowel obstruction, such as bowel perforation or necrosis.
6. Cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest, particularly given the patient's history of NSTEMI and chronic diastolic heart failure.
7. Nutritional issues, particularly given the patient's history of poor oral intake and potential need for tube feeds or parenteral nutrition.

Given the patient's complex medical status and potential complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management in the ICU, with regular interdisciplinary rounds and family meetings to discuss goals of care and potential treatment options."

   Assessment and Plan
   Resp failure, acute on chronic renal failure, alt mental status,
   worsening metabolic acidosis.
   Treated empirically for COPD exacerbation- on prednisone 60 mg daily.
   CHF doesn't seem to be major component based on exam, cxr.
   Renal failure - no acute indication for dialysis but oliguric.
   Need family meeting to address multiple organ failures which are acute
   on chronic.
   Poor nutrition- pt refused feeding tube in the past and has had very
   poor PO intake over the past few weeks. Has feeding tube but pt has
   refused tube feeds, refused PEG, refused placement of dobhoff. Will
   discuss with family and determine feeding plan today.
   Meropenem for UTI.
   Partial SBO, good bowel sounds.
   Need family meeting- will also try to include Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 616**] and renal
   service.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 1 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old individual with a history of chronic respiratory and renal failure, chronic diastolic heart failure, chronic respiratory failure requiring a tracheostomy, diabetes mellitus, and a previous pulmonary embolism. The patient was admitted to the ICU with worsening mental status, respiratory distress, and worsening acidosis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.8°C (100°F) to 37.3°C (99.1°F)
* Heart rate: 90 beats per minute (bpm) with a range of 90-101 bpm
* Blood pressure: 142/74 mmHg to 107/48 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute with a range of 13-25 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 97%

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a set tidal volume of 541 mL and a spontaneous tidal volume of 697 mL. The patient's respiratory support is being monitored, with a RSBI of 30 and a PIP of 20 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 7.9 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 12.0 to 12.5 K/uL
* Platelet count: 465 to 430 K/uL
* Creatinine: 6.3 to 7.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 1.42 to 0.78 ng/mL
* TCO2: 13 mmol/L
* Glucose: 66 to 112 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 23.6/47.1/2.3, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 134/10/0.78, Lactic Acid: 0.7 mmol/L, Ca++: 8.6 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.6 mg/dL, PO4: 6.6 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and worsening metabolic acidosis
* Treated empirically for COPD exacerbation with prednisone 60 mg daily
* Renal failure, with no acute indication for dialysis but oliguric
* Need for a family meeting to address multiple organ failures, which are acute on chronic
* Poor nutrition, with the patient refusing feeding tube, PEG, and Dobhoff placement
* Meropenem for UTI
* Partial SBO, with good bowel sounds

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is acute on chronic, and the patient is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's RSBI is 30, which is concerning for potential respiratory failure.
* Renal failure: The patient's renal failure is chronic, and the patient is oliguric. The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and the patient may require dialysis.
* Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is worsening, and the patient's TCO2 levels are 13 mmol/L. The patient may require treatment for metabolic acidosis.
* UTI: The patient is receiving meropenem for a UTI, and the patient's urine output is poor.
* SBO: The patient has a partial SBO, and the patient's bowel sounds are good. The patient may require treatment for the SBO.
* Poor nutrition: The patient is refusing nutrition, and the patient's nutritional status is poor. The patient may require treatment for poor nutrition.
* Multiple organ failures: The patient has multiple organ failures, including respiratory, renal, and metabolic failure. The patient may require treatment for multiple organ failures.

Overall, the patient is critically ill, and the patient requires close monitoring and treatment for multiple organ failures."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Multiorgan failure: Resp failure, acute on chronic renal failure, alt
   mental status, worsening metabolic acidosis, coagulopathic, SBO.
   Treated empirically for COPD exacerbation- on prednisone 60 mg daily.
   CHF doesn't seem to be major component based on exam, cxr.
   Renal failure - no acute indication for dialysis but oliguric.
   Poor nutrition- pt refused feeding tube in the past and has had very
   poor PO intake over the past few weeks. Has feeding tube but pt has
   refused tube feeds, refused PEG, refused placement of dobhoff. Will
   discuss with family and determine feeding plan today.
   Meropenem for UTI.
   Partial SBO, good bowel sounds.
   Need family meeting- will also try to include Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 616**] and renal
   service.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old individual with a history of chronic respiratory and renal failure, chronic diastolic heart failure, chronic respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, diabetes mellitus, and prior pulmonary embolism. The patient was admitted to the ICU with worsening mental status, respiratory distress, and worsening acidosis, with poor urine output.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Respiratory failure
* Acute on chronic renal failure
* Alternative mental status
* Worsening metabolic acidosis
* Coagulopathy
* Small bowel obstruction (SBO)
* Poor nutrition
* Oliguric renal failure
* Tracheostomy in place
* Ventilator-dependent
* Hemodynamic instability with a heart rate of 90-101 bpm and blood pressure of 142/74-107/48 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 7.9 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 12.0-10.2 K/uL
* Platelet count: 465-430 K/uL
* Creatinine: 6.3-7.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 103-112 mg/dL
* Glucose: 66-112 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.6 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 6.6 mg/dL

The patient's radiology results show:

* Chest X-ray: Not provided
* Abdominal X-ray: Not provided

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Rhonchorous lung sounds
* Tracheostomy in place
* Abdomen: Soft, distended, and hypoactive bowel sounds
* No rash

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Empiric treatment for COPD exacerbation with prednisone 60 mg daily
* Renal failure management with oliguric renal failure
* Poor nutrition management with discussion of feeding plan with family
* Meropenem for UTI
* Partial SBO management with good bowel sounds
* Family meeting to discuss patient's condition and plan of care
* Need for stress ulcer prophylaxis with sucralafate
* DVT prophylaxis with systemic anticoagulation
* VAP prophylaxis with suctioning and elevation of head of bed

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure leading to further deterioration of lung function
* Acute kidney injury leading to worsening of renal failure
* SBO leading to bowel perforation or obstruction
* Coagulopathy leading to bleeding complications
* Poor nutrition leading to further decline in patient's condition
* Metabolic acidosis leading to further deterioration of patient's condition
* Cardiovascular instability leading to cardiac arrest or arrhythmias

The patient's condition is critically ill, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications and improve their chances of survival."

   [**7-22**] - Blooc Cx - NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   P:69 yo female with multiple medical problems including DM2, recent
   MRSA bacteremia, COPD s/p trach, CKD, originally admitted to the ICU
   with altered mental status found to have UTI, partial SBO and acute
   renal failure now being transferred back to the ICU with acute on
   chronic multiorgan system failure.
   .
   # Altered mental status: On admission patient was somnolent but
   responding to commands.  According to team she is only slightly more
   somnolent than her prior baseline. Head CT negative for evidence of
   bleed. Likely multifactorial including infection, renal failure, poor
   nutrition.
   - Treat urinary tract infection
   - Per family discuss
 hold on tube feeding as pt w/ discomfort from NG
   .
   # Acute on chronic Respiratory Failure - s/p trach 03/[**2139**]. Was
   originally on face mask. Now more acedemic likely seconday to renal
   failure and not able to compensate. Also, not moving much air likley
   secondary to COPD exacerbation. CXR unchanged. She does not appear
   overtly volume overloaded despite being oliguric.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed.
   - Convert steroids to IV as plan to withdraw NGT
   - Restart on vent with goal pH of 7.2,
   - Hold on IVF at this point and reserve only for hypotension
   - DC po bicarb
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt with progressive worsening of renal failure
   Cr now 7.5. Likely related to ATN during previous episodes of
   hypotension also recurrent UTIs, possible prior AIN. Dialysis has been
   discussed but to felt to be needed urgently.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
 discuss future HD with family
 felt it
   will like not alter long-term outcome given multiorgan system failure
   - conrrect acid-base disturbance as much as possible with vent
   - renal US negative for obstruction
   .
   # UTI: History of bad panresistant infections.  Urine culture with
   enterobacter sensitive to meropenum
   - continue meropenum for UTI
   .
   # Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan from outside
   hospital.  Seen by surgery in the ED - nonoperative candidate, NG tube
   placed.  Abdominal exam notable for distension, nontender, diminished
   BS, now soft with + BS
   - Serial abdominal exams, continue NGT
 clinically improving
   - NPO as diet, IVF PRN
   - Need to address nutritional status with family as patient had
   declined tube feeds in the past  - continue to hold per family meeting
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Troponin of 1.51 on admission to ED in setting of increased
   creatinine.  Case discussed with cardiology who did not feel
   intervention necessary at this time.  At this point timing of event is
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 278**] echo on [**6-29**] showed EF 50-55%, repeat on [**7-22**] no new
   focal wall motion abnormalities, but suboptimal study.  Pt with
   increasing ectopy on telemetry
 rate related LBBB. Troponins trending
   down overall from admission
   - Continue beta blocker
   .
   # Seizures:
   - Continue trileptal
 hold given DC of NGT
   .
   #. Diabetes Mellitus:
   - FS QID, continue on RISS
   .
   #. Chronic diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue beta blocker at slightly decreased dose.
   - Monitor volume status
   .
   # Hypertension: Has been intermittently hypotensive.
   - DC hydral and diltiazem for low BP
   - continue BB
   .
   #. Nutrition: As of last discharge the patient was currently tolerating
   minimal po intake with PMV. Speech and swallow cleared patient for
   taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of puress and ice chips
   whicle trach collar in place with cuff deflated and PMV in place.
   There was a family discussion and patient declined placement of Dobhoff
   or PEG tube. Will hold on TF for now per discussion with family.
   .
   # PPx: PPI, bowel regimen
   .
   # Code: DNR
 family meeting held on [**7-27**]. Cardiac resuscitation not
   medically indicated given pt
s multiorgan system failure. Family
   agreeable to change in code status
   .
   # Goals of care
 family meeting held today. Family members will
   consider transitioning to goals of comfort given pt
s overall poor
   prognosis. Will continue medical regimen but hold on any procedures
   that may cause pt discomfort. Focus goals of care on comfort

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   P:69 yo female with multiple medical problems including DM2, recent
   MRSA bacteremia, COPD s/p trach, CKD, originally admitted to the ICU
   with altered mental status found to have UTI, partial SBO and acute
   renal failure now being transferred back to the ICU with acute on
   chronic multiorgan system failure.
   .
   # Altered mental status: On admission patient was somnolent but
   responding to commands.  According to team she is only slightly more
   somnolent than her prior baseline. Head CT negative for evidence of
   bleed. Likely multifactorial including infection, renal failure, poor
   nutrition.
   - Treat urinary tract infection
   - Per family discuss
 hold on tube feeding as pt w/ discomfort from NG
   .
   # Acute on chronic Respiratory Failure - s/p trach 03/[**2139**]. Was
   originally on face mask. Now more acedemic likely seconday to renal
   failure and not able to compensate. Also, not moving much air likley
   secondary to COPD exacerbation. CXR unchanged. She does not appear
   overtly volume overloaded despite being oliguric.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed.
   - Convert steroids to IV as plan to withdraw NGT
   - Restart on vent with goal pH of 7.2,
   - Hold on IVF at this point and reserve only for hypotension
   - DC po bicarb
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Pt with progressive worsening of renal failure
   Cr now 7.5. Likely related to ATN during previous episodes of
   hypotension also recurrent UTIs, possible prior AIN. Dialysis has been
   discussed but to felt to be needed urgently.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
 discuss future HD with family
 felt it
   will like not alter long-term outcome given multiorgan system failure
   - conrrect acid-base disturbance as much as possible with vent
   - renal US negative for obstruction
   .
   # UTI: History of bad panresistant infections.  Urine culture with
   enterobacter sensitive to meropenum
   - continue meropenum for UTI
   .
   # Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan from outside
   hospital.  Seen by surgery in the ED - nonoperative candidate, NG tube
   placed.  Abdominal exam notable for distension, nontender, diminished
   BS, now soft with + BS
   - Serial abdominal exams, continue NGT
 clinically improving
   - NPO as diet, IVF PRN
   - Need to address nutritional status with family as patient had
   declined tube feeds in the past  - continue to hold per family meeting
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Troponin of 1.51 on admission to ED in setting of increased
   creatinine.  Case discussed with cardiology who did not feel
   intervention necessary at this time.  At this point timing of event is
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 278**] echo on [**6-29**] showed EF 50-55%, repeat on [**7-22**] no new
   focal wall motion abnormalities, but suboptimal study.  Pt with
   increasing ectopy on telemetry
 rate related LBBB. Troponins trending
   down overall from admission
   - Continue beta blocker

   # Seizures:
   - Continue trileptal
 hold given DC of NGT
   .
   #. Diabetes Mellitus:
   - FS QID, continue on RISS
   .
   #. Chronic diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue beta blocker at slightly decreased dose.
   - Monitor volume status
   .
   # Hypertension: Has been intermittently hypotensive.
   - DC hydral and diltiazem for low BP
   - continue BB
   .
   #. Nutrition: As of last discharge the patient was currently tolerating
   minimal po intake with PMV. Speech and swallow cleared patient for
   taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of puress and ice chips
   whicle trach collar in place with cuff deflated and PMV in place.
   There was a family discussion and patient declined placement of Dobhoff
   or PEG tube. Will hold on TF for now per discussion with family.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus type 2, recent MRSA bacteremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and acute on chronic multiorgan system failure. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with altered mental status, urinary tract infection (UTI), partial small bowel obstruction (SBO), and acute renal failure. The patient's condition has deteriorated, and she is now minimally responsive to stimuli.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* Heart rate: 86 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 135/68 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 12 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Spontaneous tidal volume (Vt): 440 mL
* Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP): 5 cmH2O
* Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2): 30%

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 12.0 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 7.8 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 465 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 7.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 64 mg/dL
* Glucose: 80 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium (Na): 136 mmol/L, potassium (K): 3.4 mmol/L, chloride (Cl): 105 mmol/L, magnesium (Mg): 2.6 mmol/L, phosphate (PO4): 6.8 mmol/L

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute on chronic respiratory failure is likely to worsen, and she may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely to progress, and she may require dialysis.
3. UTI: The patient's UTI may recur, and she may require further antibiotics.
4. SBO: The patient's partial SBO may worsen, and she may require surgical intervention.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's recent NSTEMI and troponin elevation may indicate cardiac damage, and she may require further cardiac evaluation and treatment.
6. Seizures: The patient's history of seizures may indicate a risk of further seizures, and she may require anticonvulsant therapy.
7. Nutrition: The patient's poor nutrition and decreased oral intake may worsen her overall condition, and she may require enteral nutrition or parenteral nutrition.
8. Infection: The patient's recent MRSA bacteremia and UTI may indicate a risk of further infections, and she may require further antibiotic therapy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and respiratory support as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider dialysis if necessary.
3. Continue antibiotics for the UTI and consider further antibiotics if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's SBO and consider surgical intervention if necessary.
5. Continue cardiac evaluation and treatment as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's seizure activity and consider anticonvulsant therapy if necessary.
7. Consider enteral or parenteral nutrition if the patient's oral intake does not improve.
8. Monitor the patient for signs of infection and consider further antibiotic therapy if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus type 2, recent MRSA bacteremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and acute on chronic multiorgan system failure.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Altered mental status: The patient is somnolent and unresponsive to commands, likely due to a combination of infection, renal failure, and poor nutrition.
* Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient has a tracheostomy and is on mechanical ventilation, with a recent increase in oxygen requirements.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 7.5 mg/dL, and dialysis has been discussed but not deemed urgently necessary.
* Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a history of pan-resistant infections and is currently being treated with meropenem.
* Small bowel obstruction: The patient has a partial small bowel obstruction, which is being managed with a nasogastric tube and serial abdominal exams.
* Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient had elevated troponin levels on admission, but cardiac intervention was not deemed necessary.
* Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures and is currently being treated with trileptal.
* Diabetes mellitus: The patient's blood sugar levels are being monitored and managed with insulin.
* Chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient has a history of chronic diastolic heart failure and is being managed with a beta blocker.
* Hypertension: The patient has been intermittently hypotensive and is being managed with a beta blocker.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further decline in mental status due to inadequate nutrition, infection, or worsening renal failure.
* Progression of respiratory failure, potentially requiring more aggressive respiratory support or consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
* Worsening of renal failure, potentially requiring dialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
* Development of sepsis or septic shock due to ongoing UTI or other infections.
* Complications related to the small bowel obstruction, such as perforation or abscess formation.
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, due to ongoing NSTEMI or chronic diastolic heart failure.
* Nutritional complications, such as malnutrition or refeeding syndrome, due to inadequate nutrition or prolonged NPO status.
* Skin breakdown or pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and poor nutrition.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and multiple organ system failures, it is essential to continue aggressive medical management while also considering the patient's quality of life and goals of care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus type 2, recent MRSA bacteremia, chronic kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, which is likely multifactorial due to renal failure, poor nutrition, and active infection.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Acute on chronic multiorgan system failure, including respiratory, renal, and metabolic dysfunction.
2. Altered mental status, which is improving but still waxing and waning.
3. Acute respiratory failure, requiring tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation.
4. Acute renal failure, which is likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from initial sepsis without full recovery.
5. Urinary tract infection (UTI) with enterobacter sensitive to meropenem, for which treatment is being continued.
6. Small bowel obstruction (SBO) with blood in stool, possibly ischemic bowel.
7. History of bad pan-resistant infections, which may impact treatment options.
8. NSTEMI with elevated troponin levels, but no intervention is planned at this time.
9. Seizures, for which trileptal is being continued.
10. Diabetes mellitus, for which finger sticks have been discontinued due to focus on comfort.
11. Chronic diastolic heart failure.
12. Poor nutrition, with no appetite and no desire for tube feeding.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure, which may worsen despite treatment with nebs and steroids.
2. Renal failure, which may progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) if not managed effectively.
3. Sepsis, which may recur due to the patient's history of bad pan-resistant infections.
4. Ischemic bowel, which may lead to bowel perforation or necrosis if not managed promptly.
5. NSTEMI, which may progress to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) if not managed effectively.
6. Seizures, which may worsen or recur if not managed properly.
7. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which may occur if the patient's blood glucose levels become elevated.
8. Metabolic acidosis, which may worsen if not managed effectively.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and multiple organ dysfunction, it is essential to continue to monitor her closely and adjust treatment plans as needed to prevent further complications and improve her overall prognosis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including DM2, recent MRSA bacteremia, COPD, CKD, and a history of bad panresistant infections. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, UTI, partial SBO, and acute renal failure. She is now being transferred back to the ICU with acute on chronic multiorgan system failure. Her current condition includes:

* Altered mental status: Somnolent, but responding to commands, likely multifactorial including infection, renal failure, and poor nutrition.
* Acute on chronic Respiratory Failure: S/p trach, now more acidic likely secondary to renal failure and not able to compensate.
* Acute renal failure: Progressive worsening of renal failure, Cr now 7.5, likely related to ATN during previous episodes of hypotension and recurrent UTIs.
* UTI: History of bad panresistant infections, urine culture with enterobacter sensitive to meropenum.
* Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan, seen by surgery in the ED, nonoperative candidate, NG tube placed.
* NSTEMI: Troponin of 1.51 on admission to ED, case discussed with cardiology who did not feel intervention necessary at this time.
* Seizures: Continue trileptal, hold given DC of NGT.
* Diabetes Mellitus: FS QID, continue on RISS.
* Chronic diastolic heart failure: Continue beta blocker at slightly decreased dose, monitor volume status.
* Hypertension: Intermittently hypotensive, DC hydral and diltiazem for low BP, continue BB.
* Nutrition: As of last discharge, patient was tolerating minimal PO intake with PMV, speech and swallow cleared patient for taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of pureed and ice chips while trach collar in place with cuff deflated and PMV in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Increased risk of sepsis and multiorgan system failure due to UTI, SBO, and NSTEMI.
* Progressive worsening of renal failure and potential need for dialysis.
* Respiratory failure and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
* Seizures and potential neurological complications.
* Poor nutritional status and potential malnutrition.
* Hypertension and potential cardiac complications.
* Increased risk of bleeding due to altered mental status and potential coagulopathy.

Recommendations:

* Continue medical regimen as outlined in the note, including antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and beta blockers.
* Monitor patient's condition closely for signs of worsening respiratory, renal, or cardiac failure.
* Consider consultation with nephrology and cardiology for further management of patient's renal and cardiac conditions.
* Discuss with family the potential need for dialysis and mechanical ventilation.
* Continue to focus on patient's comfort and quality of life, considering the patient's poor prognosis and multiorgan system failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus type 2, recent MRSA bacteremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a history of poor nutrition. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, urinary tract infection (UTI), partial small bowel obstruction (SBO), and acute renal failure. She was transferred back to the ICU with acute on chronic multiorgan system failure.

The patient's current condition is:

* Altered mental status: likely multifactorial, including infection, renal failure, and poor nutrition
* Acute on chronic respiratory failure: continues to tolerate tracheostomy mask
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: no active bleeding, no plans to transfuse or work-up
* Acute on chronic renal failure: progressive worsening of renal failure, Cr now 8.5, likely related to ATN during previous episodes of hypotension and recurrent UTIs
* UTI: history of pan-resistant infections, urine culture with enterobacter sensitive to meropenem
* Small bowel obstruction: partial SBO noted on CT scan, non-operative candidate, NG tube placed
* NSTEMI: troponin of 1.51 on admission, case discussed with cardiology, no intervention necessary at this time
* Seizures: continue trileptal, hold given D/C of NGT
* Diabetes Mellitus: continue FS QID, continue on RISS
* Nutrition: minimal PO intake, speech and swallow cleared patient for taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of pureed food and ice chips

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: due to UTI and chronic kidney disease, the patient is at high risk for sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: the patient's acute on chronic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
3. Renal failure: the patient's acute on chronic renal failure may worsen, leading to end-stage renal disease.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may worsen, leading to hemorrhagic shock.
5. Seizures: the patient's seizures may worsen, leading to status epilepticus.
6. NSTEMI: the patient's NSTEMI may worsen, leading to myocardial infarction.
7. UTI: the patient's UTI may worsen, leading to bacteremia and sepsis.
8. Small bowel obstruction: the patient's small bowel obstruction may worsen, leading to bowel perforation and peritonitis.
9. Malnutrition: the patient's malnutrition may worsen, leading to protein-energy malnutrition and impaired immune function.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for UTI and monitor for signs of sepsis.
2. Continue respiratory support with tracheostomy mask and monitor for signs of respiratory failure.
3. Continue renal replacement therapy and monitor for signs of worsening renal failure.
4. Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and consider endoscopy or surgery if bleeding is severe.
5. Continue anticonvulsants for seizures and monitor for signs of worsening seizure activity.
6. Continue medical therapy for NSTEMI and monitor for signs of worsening cardiac function.
7. Monitor for signs of worsening UTI and consider adjusting antibiotics if necessary.
8. Monitor for signs of worsening small bowel obstruction and consider surgical intervention if necessary.
9. Consider enteral nutrition to improve nutritional status and monitor for signs of improvement in protein-energy malnutrition."

   Assessment and Plan
   P:69 yo female with multiple medical problems including DM2, recent
   MRSA bacteremia, COPD s/p trach, CKD, originally admitted to the ICU
   with altered mental status found to have UTI, partial SBO and acute
   renal failure now  in ICU with acute on chronic multiorgan system
   failure.
   # Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial including infection,
   renal failure, poor nutrition. Brighter today.
   - Treat urinary tract infection
   - Per family discuss
 hold on tube feeding as pt w/ discomfort from NG
   # Acute on chronic Respiratory Failure - s/p trach 03/[**2139**]. Continues
   to tolerate trach mask.
   - will not go back on vent as per discussion with daughter, [**Name (NI) 3213**], as
   documented in Dr [**Name (NI) 3129**]
s note in paper chart.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed.
   -Continue steroids
   #  GIB:  HCT with small drop. No active bleeding at present.  No plans
   to transfuse or work-up per discussion with family.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Pt with progressive worsening of
   renal failure
 Cr now 8.5. Likely related to ATN during previous
   episodes of hypotension also recurrent UTIs, possible prior AIN.
   - no plans for HD
   # UTI: History of bad panresistant infections.  Urine culture with
   enterobacter sensitive to meropenum
   - continue meropenum for UTI
   # Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan from outside
   hospital.  Seen by surgery in the ED - nonoperative candidate, NG tube
   placed.  Abdominal exam notable for distension, nontender, diminished
   BS, now soft with + BS
   # NSTEMI:  Troponin of 1.51 on admission to ED in setting of increased
   creatinine.  Case discussed with cardiology who did not feel
   intervention necessary at this time.  At this point timing of event is
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 278**] echo on [**6-29**] showed EF 50-55%, repeat on [**7-22**] no new
   focal wall motion abnormalities, but suboptimal study.  Pt with
   increasing ectopy on telemetry
 rate related LBBB. Troponins trending
   down overall from admission
   - Continue beta blocker
   # Seizures:
   - Continue trileptal
 hold given D/C of NGT
   #. Diabetes Mellitus:
   - FS QID, continue on RISS
   #. Nutrition: As of last discharge the patient was currently tolerating
   minimal po intake with PMV. Speech and swallow cleared patient for
   taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of puress and ice chips
   whicle trach collar in place with cuff deflated and PMV in place.
   There was a family discussion and patient declined placement of Dobhoff
   or PEG tube. Will hold on TF for now per discussion with family, as
   they feel that the feeding tube was clearly uncomfortable for her.
   # PPx: PPI, bowel regimen
   # Code: DNR
 family meeting held on [**7-27**]. Cardiac resuscitation not
   medically indicated given pt
s multiorgan system failure. Family
   agreeable to change in code status
   # Goals of care
 Family members will consider transitioning to goals
   of comfort given pt
s overall poor prognosis. Will continue medical
   regimen but hold on any procedures that may cause pt discomfort. Focus
   goals of care on comfort

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   renal failure
 Cr now 8.5. Likely related to ATN during previous
   episodes of hypotension also recurrent UTIs, possible prior AIN.
   - no plans for HD
   # UTI: History of bad panresistant infections.  Urine culture with
   enterobacter sensitive to meropenum
   - continue meropenum for UTI
   # Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan from outside
   hospital.  Seen by surgery in the ED - nonoperative candidate, NG tube
   placed.  Abdominal exam notable for distension, nontender, diminished
   BS, now soft with + BS
   # NSTEMI:  Troponin of 1.51 on admission to ED in setting of increased
   creatinine.  Case discussed with cardiology who did not feel
   intervention necessary at this time.  At this point timing of event is
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 278**] echo on [**6-29**] showed EF 50-55%, repeat on [**7-22**] no new
   focal wall motion abnormalities, but suboptimal study.  Pt with
   increasing ectopy on telemetry

   down overall from admission
   - Continue beta blocker
   # Seizures:
   - Continue trileptal
 hold given D/C of NGT
   #. Diabetes Mellitus:
   - FS QID, continue on RISS

   minimal po intake with PMV. Speech and swallow cleared patient for
   taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of puress and ice chips
   whicle trach collar in place with cuff deflated and PMV in place.
   There was a family discussion and patient declined placement of Dobhoff

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus type 2, recent MRSA bacteremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with tracheostomy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and acute renal failure. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with altered mental status, urinary tract infection (UTI), partial small bowel obstruction (SBO), and acute on chronic multiorgan system failure.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Altered mental status, likely multifactorial, including infection, renal failure, and poor nutrition
* Acute on chronic respiratory failure, tolerating tracheostomy mask
* Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with a small drop in hemoglobin (HCT) and no active bleeding
* Acute on chronic renal failure, with a creatinine level of 8.5 mg/dL, likely related to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and recurrent UTIs
* UTI, with a sensitive urine culture and ongoing treatment with meropenem
* Partial SBO, with distension and diminished bowel sounds
* Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), with a troponin level of 1.51 on admission and ongoing treatment with a beta blocker
* Seizures, with ongoing treatment with trileptal and a hold on nasogastric tube (NGT)
* Diabetes mellitus, with ongoing treatment with insulin and metformin
* Nutrition, with minimal oral intake and ongoing tube feeding (TF) with a hold per family request
* Cardiac status, with a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate) and a cardiac echo showing an ejection fraction of 50-55%

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Further deterioration of her respiratory status, leading to respiratory failure
* Worsening of her renal function, leading to acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease progression
* Development of sepsis or septic shock due to ongoing infection
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to partial SBO
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, due to ongoing NSTEMI
* Neurological complications, such as further seizures or decreased level of consciousness, due to ongoing UTI or other underlying conditions
* Discomfort or pain related to her medical conditions, which may impact her quality of life and overall well-being."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 2, recent MRSA bacteremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and acute on chronic multiorgan system failure.

The patient's current condition is marked by:

1. Altered mental status, which is likely multifactorial, including renal failure, poor nutrition, and active infection.
2. Acute on chronic respiratory failure, with a tracheostomy in place and ongoing treatment with nebulizers and steroids.
3. Acute renal failure, which is likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from initial sepsis without full recovery.
4. Urinary tract infection (UTI) with enterobacter sensitive to meropenem, which is being treated with antibiotics.
5. Small bowel obstruction (SBO) with blood in stool, possibly ischemic bowel, with a focus on comfort care rather than surgical intervention.
6. Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with a troponin level of 1.51 on admission, which is being managed with beta blockers.
7. Seizures, which are being treated with trileptal.
8. Diabetes mellitus, which is being managed with regular insulin sliding scale.
9. Chronic diastolic heart failure.
10. Poor nutrition, with the patient not eating and no appetite, and a decision to discontinue tube feeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Further deterioration of mental status due to ongoing renal failure, infection, and poor nutrition.
2. Worsening of respiratory failure, which could lead to respiratory arrest or death.
3. Progression of acute renal failure to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
4. Development of sepsis or septic shock due to ongoing infection.
5. Ischemic bowel complications, such as perforation or hemorrhage, due to the SBO.
6. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock, due to the NSTEMI.
7. Seizure recurrence or worsening due to the underlying condition.
8. Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to the diabetes mellitus and insulin therapy.
9. Dehydration or electrolyte imbalance due to the poor nutrition and ongoing fluid losses.
10. Development of pressure ulcers or other skin complications due to immobility and poor nutrition.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the plan is to focus on comfort care, with the goal of improving the patient's quality of life and reducing suffering."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 2, recent MRSA bacteremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a tracheostomy. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with altered mental status, urinary tract infection (UTI), partial small bowel obstruction (SBO), and acute renal failure. She is currently experiencing acute on chronic multiorgan system failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 87 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 145/73 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a tracheostomy collar in place.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.5-11.2 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 7.6-7.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 56-47 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 6.1-7.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.78-0.96 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.4-8.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.5-2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 7.2-7.1 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions and treatment plan include:

* Altered mental status: Improving, likely multifactorial, with renal failure, poor nutrition, and active infection.
* Acute on chronic respiratory failure: On tracheostomy collar, with COPD treatment and nebulizers.
* Acute renal failure: Not indicated for dialysis, as it will not improve overall long-term survival.
* UTI: Sensitive to meropenem, with continued treatment.
* Lower GI bleed: Likely due to coagulopathy from poor nutrition, with a plan to hold on blood transfusions and focus on comfort.
* SBO: With blood in stool, possibly ischemic bowel, with a plan to focus on comfort.
* Seizures: Held on trileptal, with a plan to reevaluate.
* Diabetes mellitus: D/c finger sticks, with a focus on comfort.
* Nutrition: NPO, with a plan to focus on comfort.

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis: The patient's UTI and SBO may lead to sepsis, which can worsen her multiorgan system failure.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's acute on chronic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease and potential end-stage renal disease.
* GI bleed: The patient's lower GI bleed may worsen, leading to hemorrhagic shock and potential death.
* Ischemic bowel: The patient's SBO with blood in stool may lead to ischemic bowel, which can cause bowel perforation and peritonitis.
* Seizures: The patient's seizure history and ongoing treatment with trileptal may lead to further seizure activity.
* Poor nutrition: The patient's NPO status and lack of appetite may lead to malnutrition, which can worsen her multiorgan system failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus type 2, recent MRSA bacteremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and altered mental status. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, urinary tract infection (UTI), partial small bowel obstruction (SBO), and acute renal failure. Currently, she is experiencing acute on chronic multiorgan system failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 145/73 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is receiving morphine for pain and discomfort.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.5-11.2 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 7.6-6.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 56-34 K/uL
* Creatinine: 7.6-6.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 53-45 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.96-0.78 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.4-8.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.5-2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 7.2-7.5 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Altered mental status: Improving, likely multifactorial, and managed with morphine and tube feeding hold.
* Acute on chronic respiratory failure: Managed with tracheostomy collar and COPD treatment.
* Acute renal failure: Managed with steroids and observation, as dialysis is not indicated.
* UTI: Managed with meropenem.
* Lower GI bleed: Managed with blood transfusion hold and focus on comfort.
* SBO: Managed with NGT decompression and focus on comfort.
* Seizures: Managed with trileptal hold.
* Diabetes mellitus: Managed with finger stick hold and focus on comfort.
* Nutrition: Patient is NPO, and tube feeding is being held.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus type 2, recent MRSA bacteremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and acute on chronic multiorgan system failure. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, which is currently stable and somnolent, likely due to toxic metabolic encephalopathy. She has acute on chronic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and a urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient has received various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain management medications. She has been on a tracheostomy collar and is not to be re-ventilated per family request.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 134/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her laboratory results show mild anemia, mild thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes.

The patient's plan is to receive comfort measures, including no re-ventilation or escalation of care. She is expected to be transferred to a medical floor and eventually sent to rehabilitation as comfort measures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of MRSA bacteremia and UTI, which increases her risk of developing further infections.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute on chronic respiratory failure, which may lead to respiratory arrest if not managed properly.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed properly.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and somnolence may be a sign of toxic metabolic encephalopathy, which can lead to neurological complications such as seizures or coma.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's lack of appetite and refusal of tube feeding may lead to malnutrition and gastrointestinal complications such as constipation or diarrhea.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of CKD and acute renal failure may increase her risk of developing cardiovascular complications such as hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction.
7. Sepsis: The patient's history of bacteremia and UTI increases her risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to multiorgan failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus type 2, recent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with tracheostomy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and acute on chronic multiorgan system failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 94 beats per minute, blood pressure of 134/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with normal head, ears, nose, and throat examination. Cardiovascular examination shows normal first and second heart sounds, with no murmurs or gallop rhythms. Respiratory examination shows symmetric chest expansion and clear breath sounds. Abdominal examination reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds. Skin examination is not assessed due to the patient's somnolent state. Neurological examination shows the patient responds to stimuli, but movement, tone, and reflexes are not assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hb), and elevated creatinine (Cr) levels. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating acute kidney injury. The patient's troponin-T level is elevated, indicating cardiac injury.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Altered mental status: stable, likely due to toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
* Acute on chronic respiratory failure: managed with tracheostomy and oxygen therapy.
* Acute renal failure: managed with conservative therapy, without dialysis.
* Urinary tract infection (UTI): treated with meropenem, with the last dose given today.
* Nutrition: patient and family do not want tube feeding, and the patient is not eating due to lack of appetite.
* Code status: do not resuscitate (DNR) and do not intubate (DNI).
* Disposition: transfer to medical floor for comfort measures, with a plan to send to rehabilitation as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: the patient's acute on chronic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory arrest or failure.
* Renal failure: the patient's acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
* Sepsis: the patient's MRSA bacteremia and UTI may lead to sepsis, which can cause organ dysfunction and failure.
* Cardiovascular complications: the patient's elevated troponin-T level and cardiac injury may lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.
* Neurological complications: the patient's altered mental status and somnolent state may be indicative of neurological complications, such as cerebral edema or encephalitis.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."
