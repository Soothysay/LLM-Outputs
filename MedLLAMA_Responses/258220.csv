   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 15 yesterday from 19 on admission that morning, but is
   increasing again to 16 this AM.  Squamous cell carcinomas of the lung
   and head and neck are known to produce PTH-rP so her SSC of the skin
   could possibly produce this.  This could also be secondary to bony mets
   ; she does have elevated Alk Phos.  Another possibility on differential
   is sarcoidosis because of increased peri-hilar densities.  PTH is
   normal level, but should be lower with such high calcium
   - IVF hydration continued.  Urine output 400cc/hr.  will start Normal
   Saline today for a few liters, then return to LR.  Once she appears
   euvolemic, will aim for UOP of 100-150 cc/hr.
   - lasix [**Hospital1 **] to lessen overall edema and fluid in lungs, possibly to
   help w Ca as well
   - Avoid calcitonin bc of allergic reaction, but ask endo about
   premedicating for calcitonin
   - f/u Endocrine Recs
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u  PTHrP  ,  Vit D
   - Bone Scan on weekday
   - Bowel regimen for constipation and zofran prn for nausea.
   - consider Hemodialysis if Ca cannot be decreased
   - f/u w Renal recs
   .
   # Perihilar densities:
   [**Month (only) 8**] be malignant spread to lymph nodes or sarcoidosis.
   - Chest CT today to evaluate perihilar areas
   - ACE level
   - f/u [**1-22**]-OH and 25-OH Vit D levels
   - speak w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who knows pt from previously
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 2.2 today from 3.2 (her baseline is 0.6-0.7).  [**Month (only) 8**] still
   be prerenal.  Abdominal US at [**Hospital1 2840**] showed no evidence of
   hydronephrosis.  Part of her ARF could also be due to the direct renal
   vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia on the kidney causing a fall
   in the GFR.
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Right posterior hip pain:
   The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, Xrays have not been
   helpful.  On exam she has no evidence of weakness or neuro findings.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to metastases or pain for positional changes. Pt also
   has left knee pain.
   - need Bone Scan this week to evaluate for metastatic/malignant lesions
   - Consider pelvis CT to evaluate the soft tissue around the hip for
   source of the pain.
   - Morphine for pain control
 consider switching to a different PO med,
   though pt feels that she had recently been having more difficulty
   swallowing recently
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:
   The patient has a mildly elevated AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase.
   Pancreatitis is a uncommon side effect of hypercalcemia so her elevated
   lipase could be secondary to pancreatitis.  Improving slowly
   - Trend LFTs/lipase
   - advance diet slowly
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids.  She is a
   Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not want tranfusion of any type
   of blood products.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Guaiac stools given history of black stool.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  The patient is s/p excision in
   [**7-6**].  She had discussed radiation treatment, but had opted against
   it.  Her current presenatation of hypercalcemia is concerning for
   reoccurance of her squamous cell carcinoma.
   - Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] about his perspective regarding her cancer status

   MICU Attending Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient, reviewed her hospital course, labs,
   and imaging, and I was present for the key portions of the services
   provided.  I have also reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9313**]
s note and agree with her
   findings and plan of care.  The patient remains hypercalcemic to Ca=16,
   and Ringers has been switched to NS to eliminate all Ca from IV
   We
ll continue to give vigorous IV NS and use lasix to avoid further
   edema and third spacing elsewhere.   Her CXR looks quite suspicious for
   sarcoid with bilateral and mediastinal adenopathy, and this might also
   explain her hypercalcemia.  We will further evaluate this with chest CT
   and serum ACE, but at some point she may come to node biopsy for
   definitive dx and rx.  Meanwhile her hip pain will be further evaluated
   with pelvic CT.  However she would seem to merit a reevaluation of the
   status of her squamous cell skin cancer (?PET-CT?), and we will contact
   Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name (NI) **], [**Name5 (PTitle) **] of whom know her well for this problem.  The
   patient is stable enough to continue her IV fluids on the floor and
   we
ll call her out to an onc floor.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   MICU Attending Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient, reviewed her hospital course, labs,
   and imaging, and I was present for the key portions of the services
   provided.  I have also reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9313**]
s note and agree with her
   findings and plan of care.  The patient remains hypercalcemic to Ca=16,
   and Ringers has been switched to NS to eliminate all Ca from IV
   We
ll continue to give vigorous IV NS and use lasix to avoid further
   edema and third spacing elsewhere.   Her CXR looks quite suspicious for
   sarcoid with bilateral and mediastinal adenopathy, and this might also
   explain her hypercalcemia.  We will further evaluate this with chest CT
   and serum ACE, but at some point she may come to node biopsy for
   definitive dx and rx.  Meanwhile her hip pain will be further evaluated
   with pelvic CT.  However she would seem to merit a reevaluation of the
   status of her squamous cell skin cancer (?PET-CT?), and we will contact
   Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name (NI) **], [**Name5 (PTitle) **] of whom know her well for this problem.  The
   patient is stable enough to continue her IV fluids on the floor and
   we
ll call her out to an onc floor.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 44-year-old female with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid medial thigh, s/p excision.
* She is currently in the ICU with hypercalcemia, acute renal failure, and elevated liver enzymes.
* She has a history of chronic iron-deficiency anemia and is a Jehovah's Witness, refusing blood transfusions.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Hypercalcemia:**
	* The patient's calcium levels are increasing, which may lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, renal damage, and neuromuscular symptoms.
	* The patient's hypercalcemia may be secondary to her metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, bony metastases, or sarcoidosis.
2. **Acute Renal Failure (ARF):**
	* The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, which may indicate worsening ARF.
	* The patient's ARF may be secondary to prerenal causes, direct renal vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia, or other underlying conditions.
3. **Elevated Liver Enzymes:**
	* The patient's liver enzymes are mildly elevated, which may indicate liver damage or dysfunction.
	* The patient's elevated lipase levels may be secondary to pancreatitis, a rare side effect of hypercalcemia.
4. **Right Posterior Hip Pain:**
	* The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, which may be secondary to metastases or pain for positional changes.
	* The patient's hip pain may be a sign of underlying bone metastases or soft tissue lesions.
5. **Perihilar Densities:**
	* The patient has perihilar densities on chest X-ray, which may be secondary to malignant spread to lymph nodes or sarcoidosis.
	* The patient's perihilar densities may be a sign of underlying lung or lymph node involvement.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's calcium levels and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Continue to manage the patient's ARF with volume repletion and close monitoring of creatinine levels.
3. Consider further evaluation of the patient's liver enzymes and lipase levels to rule out underlying liver damage or pancreatitis.
4. Continue to evaluate the patient's hip pain and consider further imaging studies to rule out underlying bone metastases or soft tissue lesions.
5. Consider further evaluation of the patient's perihilar densities to rule out underlying lung or lymph node involvement.

**Future Plans:**

1. Continue to manage the patient's hypercalcemia and ARF in the ICU.
2. Consider transferring the patient to an oncology floor for further evaluation and treatment of her metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's liver enzymes and lipase levels to rule out underlying liver damage or pancreatitis.
4. Consider further imaging studies to evaluate the patient's hip pain and perihilar densities.
5. Consult with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and other specialists to further evaluate the patient's condition and develop a comprehensive treatment plan."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 15 yesterday from 19 on admission that morning, but is
   increasing again to 16 this AM.  Squamous cell carcinomas of the lung
   and head and neck are known to produce PTH-rP so her SSC of the skin
   could possibly produce this.  This could also be secondary to bony mets
   ; she does have elevated Alk Phos.  Another possibility on differential
   is sarcoidosis because of increased peri-hilar densities.  PTH is
   normal level, but should be lower with such high calcium
   - IVF hydration continued.  Urine output 400cc/hr.  will start Normal
   Saline today for a few liters, then return to LR.  Once she appears
   euvolemic, will aim for UOP of 100-150 cc/hr.
   - lasix [**Hospital1 **] to lessen overall edema and fluid in lungs, possibly to
   help w Ca as well
   - Avoid calcitonin bc of allergic reaction, but ask endo about
   premedicating for calcitonin
   - f/u Endocrine Recs
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u  PTHrP  ,  Vit D
   - Bone Scan on weekday
   - Bowel regimen for constipation and zofran prn for nausea.
   - consider Hemodialysis if Ca cannot be decreased
   - f/u w Renal recs
   .
   # Perihilar densities:
   [**Month (only) 8**] be malignant spread to lymph nodes or sarcoidosis.
   - Chest CT today to evaluate perihilar areas
   - ACE level
   - f/u [**1-22**]-OH and 25-OH Vit D levels
   - speak w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who knows pt from previously
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 2.2 today from 3.2 (her baseline is 0.6-0.7).  [**Month (only) 8**] still
   be prerenal.  Abdominal US at [**Hospital1 2840**] showed no evidence of
   hydronephrosis.  Part of her ARF could also be due to the direct renal
   vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia on the kidney causing a fall
   in the GFR.
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Right posterior hip pain:
   The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, Xrays have not been
   helpful.  On exam she has no evidence of weakness or neuro findings.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to metastases or pain for positional changes. Pt also
   has left knee pain.
   - need Bone Scan this week to evaluate for metastatic/malignant lesions
   - Consider pelvis CT to evaluate the soft tissue around the hip for
   source of the pain.
   - Morphine for pain control
 consider switching to a different PO med,
   though pt feels that she had recently been having more difficulty
   swallowing recently
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:
   The patient has a mildly elevated AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase.
   Pancreatitis is a uncommon side effect of hypercalcemia so her elevated
   lipase could be secondary to pancreatitis.  Improving slowly
   - Trend LFTs/lipase
   - advance diet slowly
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids.  She is a
   Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not want tranfusion of any type
   of blood products.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Guaiac stools given history of black stool.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  The patient is s/p excision in
   [**7-6**].  She had discussed radiation treatment, but had opted against
   it.  Her current presenatation of hypercalcemia is concerning for

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 15 yesterday from 19 on admission that morning, but is
   increasing again to 16 this AM.  Squamous cell carcinomas of the lung
   and head and neck are known to produce PTH-rP so her SSC of the skin
   could possibly produce this.  This could also be secondary to bony mets
   ; she does have elevated Alk Phos.  Another possibility on differential
   is sarcoidosis because of increased peri-hilar densities.  PTH is
   normal level, but should be lower with such high calcium
   - IVF hydration continued.  Urine output 400cc/hr.  will start Normal
   Saline today for a few liters, then return to LR.  Once she appears
   euvolemic, will aim for UOP of 100-150 cc/hr.
   - lasix [**Hospital1 **] to lessen overall edema and fluid in lungs, possibly to
   help w Ca as well
   - Avoid calcitonin bc of allergic reaction, but ask endo about
   premedicating for calcitonin
   - f/u Endocrine Recs
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u  PTHrP  ,  Vit D
   - Bone Scan on weekday
   - Bowel regimen for constipation and zofran prn for nausea.
   - consider Hemodialysis if Ca cannot be decreased
   - f/u w Renal recs
   .
   # Perihilar densities:
   [**Month (only) 8**] be malignant spread to lymph nodes or sarcoidosis.
   - Chest CT today to evaluate perihilar areas
   - ACE level
   - f/u [**1-22**]-OH and 25-OH Vit D levels
   - speak w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who knows pt from previously
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 2.2 today from 3.2 (her baseline is 0.6-0.7).  [**Month (only) 8**] still
   be prerenal.  Abdominal US at [**Hospital1 2840**] showed no evidence of
   hydronephrosis.  Part of her ARF could also be due to the direct renal
   vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia on the kidney causing a fall
   in the GFR.
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Right posterior hip pain:
   The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, Xrays have not been
   helpful.  On exam she has no evidence of weakness or neuro findings.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to metastases or pain for positional changes. Pt also
   has left knee pain.
   - need Bone Scan this week to evaluate for metastatic/malignant lesions
   - Consider pelvis CT to evaluate the soft tissue around the hip for
   source of the pain.
   - Morphine for pain control
 consider switching to a different PO med,
   though pt feels that she had recently been having more difficulty
   swallowing recently
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:
   The patient has a mildly elevated AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase.
   Pancreatitis is a uncommon side effect of hypercalcemia so her elevated
   lipase could be secondary to pancreatitis.  Improving slowly
   - Trend LFTs/lipase
   - advance diet slowly
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids.  She is a
   Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not want tranfusion of any type
   of blood products.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Guaiac stools given history of black stool.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  The patient is s/p excision in
   [**7-6**].  She had discussed radiation treatment, but had opted against
   it.  Her current presenatation of hypercalcemia is concerning for
   reoccurance of her squamous cell carcinoma.
   - Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] about his perspective regarding her cancer status

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are increasing, which can lead to various complications such as kidney stone formation, pancreatitis, and cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and there is a risk of further deterioration of renal function due to the patient's hypercalcemia and potential prerenal azotemia.
3. Sarcoidosis: The patient's elevated alkaline phosphatase levels and peri-hilar densities on chest CT suggest a possibility of sarcoidosis, which can lead to respiratory and cardiac complications.
4. Malignant Spread: The patient's metastatic squamous cell carcinoma may spread to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, liver, and bones, which can lead to various complications such as pain, bleeding, and organ dysfunction.
5. Constipation: The patient's constipation is likely due to her hypercalcemia and can lead to bowel obstruction, abdominal pain, and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Nausea and Vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's hypercalcemia can lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypercalcemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, and cardiac failure.
9. Neurological Complications: The patient's hypercalcemia can lead to neurological complications such as seizures, encephalopathy, and peripheral neuropathy.
10. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and hypercalcemia can increase the risk of infection, including sepsis and pneumonia.

The patient's care plan should focus on managing her hypercalcemia, acute renal failure, and other complications, as well as monitoring her for signs of malignant spread, respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological complications."

   1. No definite findings to account for the patient's symptoms. Small
   sclerotic focus along the inner table of the lateral cortex in the
   proximal
   left femur is unchanged from [**2175-6-5**]. Of note, if there remains concern
   for
   metastatic disease in the bones, CT or bone scan would provide more
   sensitive
   evaluation.
   2. Medial left thigh abscess seen on outside hospital CT is not imaged
   in the
   field of view.
   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 15 yesterday from 19 on admission that morning, but is
   increasing again to 16 this AM.  Squamous cell carcinomas of the lung
   and head and neck are known to produce PTH-rP so her SSC of the skin
   could possibly produce this.  This could also be secondary to bony mets
   ; she does have elevated Alk Phos.
   - IVF hydration continued.  Urine output 400cc/hr.  will start Normal
   Saline today for a few liters, then return to LR.  Once she appears
   euvolemic, will aim for UOP of 100-150 cc/hr.
   - Avoid calcitonin bc of allergic reaction
   - f/u Endocrine Recs
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u PTH  , PTHrP  ,  Vit D
   - Bone Scan on weekday
   - Bowel regimen for constipation and zofran prn for nausea.
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 2.2 today from 3.2 (her baseline is 0.6-0.7).  Likely
   prerenal.  Abdominal US at [**Hospital1 2840**]  showed no evidence of
   hydronephrosis.  Part of her ARF could also be due to the direct renal
   vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia on the kidney causing a fall
   in the GFR.
   - Volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Check Urine lytes
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Right posterior hip pain:
   The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, Xrays have not been
   helpful.  On exam she has no evidence of weakness or neuro findings.
   - need Bone Scan
   - Consider pelvis CT to evaluate the soft tissue around the hip for
   source of the pain.
   - Morphine 2-4 mg IV q6h prn for pain control.
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:
   The patient has a mildly elevated AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase.
   Pancreatitis is a uncommon side effect of hypercalcemia so her elevated
   lipase could be secondary to pancreatitis.
   - Trend LFTs/lipase
   - NPO for now with IVF.
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids.  She is a
   Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not want tranfusion of any type
   of blood products.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Guaiac stools given history of black stool.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  The patient is s/p excision in
   [**7-6**].  She had discussed radiation treatment, but had opted against
   it.  Her current presenatation of hypercalcemia is concerning for
   reoccurance of her squamous cell carcinoma.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8 mg/dL, which has decreased to 16 mg/dL this morning. The patient has a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid medial thigh, which was excised in July.

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Hypercalcemia: Ca++ levels are increasing again, despite IVF hydration and pamidronate treatment. The patient has elevated Alk Phos levels, which could indicate bone metastases.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): Cr levels have improved to 2.2 mg/dL, but the patient remains at risk due to prerenal factors and potential direct renal vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia.
3. Right Posterior Hip Pain: The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, with no evidence of weakness or neuro findings. A bone scan and/or pelvis CT may be necessary to evaluate the source of the pain.
4. Elevated LFTs/Lipase: The patient has mildly elevated AST, Alk Phos, LDH, and lipase levels, which could indicate pancreatitis or other underlying conditions.
5. Chronic Iron-Deficiency Anemia: The patient's Hct is 29, which is lower than her baseline. She is a Jehovah's Witness and would not accept blood transfusions.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening hypercalcemia, leading to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and respiratory failure.
2. Progressive ARF, requiring dialysis or further interventions.
3. Development of pancreatitis or other complications related to elevated LFTs/Lipase.
4. Recurrence of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, which could lead to further complications and poor outcomes.
5. Failure to manage the patient's chronic iron-deficiency anemia, which could lead to further complications and poor outcomes.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor her progress and adjust treatment plans accordingly. Further evaluation and management of the patient's hypercalcemia, ARF, right posterior hip pain, elevated LFTs/Lipase, and chronic iron-deficiency anemia are necessary to improve her outcomes."

   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 14.1 yesterday evening, patient refused labs overnight
   and this morning nursing and IV nurse were unable to draw labs or place
   a new peripheral, put patient in for a PICC.  CT scan showed concern
   for progression of malignancy with innumerable pulmonary nodules, hilar
   masses, bony lesions in the iliac bones bilaterally and left inguinal
   enlarging LAD.  Given new CT scan findings the most likely etiology is
   recurrence of her metastatic disease, especially with the bony mets
   seen in her pelvis on CT.  Prior to the CT scan based on CXR findings,
   there was concern for possible Sarcoid, which seems less likely now,
   but will follow up final CT scan read.
   - Have been continuing NS with 20meq of K+ at 300cc/hr with lasix [**Hospital1 **],

   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 14.1 yesterday evening, patient refused labs overnight
   and this morning nursing and IV nurse were unable to draw labs or place
   a new peripheral, put patient in for a PICC.  CT scan showed concern
   for progression of malignancy with innumerable pulmonary nodules, hilar
   masses, bony lesions in the iliac bones bilaterally and left inguinal
   enlarging LAD.  Given new CT scan findings the most likely etiology is
   recurrence of her metastatic disease, especially with the bony mets
   seen in her pelvis on CT.  Prior to the CT scan based on CXR findings,
   there was concern for possible Sarcoid, which seems less likely now,
   but will follow up final CT scan read.
   - Have been continuing NS with 20meq of K+ at 300cc/hr with lasix [**Hospital1 **],

   has left knee pain.
   - need Bone Scan this week to evaluate for metastatic/malignant lesions
   - Consider pelvis CT to evaluate the soft tissue around the hip for
   source of the pain.
   - Morphine for pain control
 consider switching to a different PO med,

   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid medial thigh, s/p excision. She was admitted with hypercalcemia, which decreased to 14.1 after treatment. Recent CT scans show innumerable lung nodules, large hilar masses, bony lesions in the iliac bones bilaterally, and left inguinal lymphadenopathy, concerning for progression of neoplastic disease.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including:

1. Hypercalcemia: Ca decreased to 14.1, but the patient refused labs overnight and this morning, and a new peripheral IV could not be placed. A PICC was inserted.
2. Acute Renal Failure: Cr improved to 2.2, but the patient still requires volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia.
3. Right Posterior Hip Pain: Focal iliac crest pain on exam, with no evidence of weakness or neuro findings. A Bone Scan is planned to evaluate for metastatic/malignant lesions.
4. Elevated LFTs/Lipase: Improving slowly, with a trend of LFTs/lipase.
5. Chronic Iron-Deficiency Anemia: Hct is 29, with a history of black stool. Guaiac stools have been given.
6. Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma: The patient's current presentation of hypercalcemia is concerning for reoccurrence of her squamous cell carcinoma.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Progressive disease: The patient's recent CT scans show significant progression of her lung nodules, hilar masses, and bony lesions, which may indicate rapid progression of her neoplastic disease.
2. Renal failure: The patient's Cr levels have improved, but she still requires volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia to prevent further renal damage.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and bone pain.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary nodules and hilar masses may compromise her respiratory function, leading to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's elevated LFTs/lipase may indicate pancreatitis or other gastrointestinal complications, which could worsen her overall condition.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and recent hospitalization may increase her risk of developing infections, which could further complicate her condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 14.1 yesterday evening, patient refused labs overnight
   and this morning nursing and IV nurse were unable to draw labs or place
   a new peripheral, put patient in for a PICC.  CT scan showed concern
   for progression of malignancy with innumerable pulmonary nodules, hilar
   masses, bony lesions in the iliac bones bilaterally and left inguinal
   enlarging LAD.  Given new CT scan findings the most likely etiology is
   recurrence of her metastatic disease, especially with the bony mets
   seen in her pelvis on CT.  Prior to the CT scan based on CXR findings,
   there was concern for possible Sarcoid, which seems less likely now,
   but will follow up final CT scan read.
   - Have been continuing NS with 20meq of K+ at 300cc/hr with lasix [**Hospital1 **],
   having difficulty drawing labs and were unable to get another
   periptheral IV, so put patient in for an urgent PICC.  If repeat
   morning labs show decreasing calcium then will decrease IVF rate to
   200cc/hr as patient is fluid overloaded with bilateral pleural
   effusions.  If Ca continues to decrease will discontinue lasix with
   decrease in IVF rate.
   -F/U morning labs
   - F/U with oncology about further plans for possible bx of lung
   lesions, pt. scheduled for bone scan today
   - f/u Endocrine Recs
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u  PTHrP ,  Vit D, ACE level
   - Increased bowel regimen for constipation and zofran prn for nausea.
   - f/u  Renal recs
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 2.2 yesterday from 3.2 (her baseline is 0.6-0.7).
   Likely due to hypercalcemia, patient currently putting out large
   volumes of urine.
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - [**Hospital1 **] Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins
No NSAIDS
   # Right posterior hip pain:
   The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, has lytic lesions on CT
   scan
   - follow up Bone Scan to evaluate for metastatic/malignant lesions
   - Morphine for pain control, small doses have currently been working
   well.
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:
   The patient had a mildly elevated AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase.  Both
   improving, patient currently tolerating a regular diet without
   difficulty, appears to have currently resolved.
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids, and has
   remained stable.  She is a Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not
   want tranfusion of any type of blood products.
   - Continue to [**Last Name (LF) 1940**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] hold iron supplements for now given
   constipation
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  Hypercalcemia and imaging are
   very concerning for metastatic disease, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is aware and will
   stop by sometime today.  Will f/u with oncology recs about the need for
   possible biopsy of one of the pulmonary nodules.  Will f/u with

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 15 yesterday from 19 on admission that morning, but is
   increasing again to 16 this AM.  Squamous cell carcinomas of the lung
   and head and neck are known to produce PTH-rP so her SSC of the skin
   could possibly produce this.  This could also be secondary to bony mets
   ; she does have elevated Alk Phos.  Another possibility on differential
   is sarcoidosis because of increased peri-hilar densities.  PTH is
   normal level, but should be lower with such high calcium
   - IVF hydration continued.  Urine output 400cc/hr.  will start Normal
   Saline today for a few liters, then return to LR.  Once she appears
   euvolemic, will aim for UOP of 100-150 cc/hr.
   - lasix [**Hospital1 **] to lessen overall edema and fluid in lungs, possibly to
   help w Ca as well
   - Avoid calcitonin bc of allergic reaction, but ask endo about
   premedicating for calcitonin
   - f/u Endocrine Recs
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u  PTHrP  ,  Vit D
   - Bone Scan on weekday
   - Bowel regimen for constipation and zofran prn for nausea.
   - consider Hemodialysis if Ca cannot be decreased
   - f/u w Renal recs
   .
   # Perihilar densities:
   [**Month (only) 8**] be malignant spread to lymph nodes or sarcoidosis.
   - Chest CT today to evaluate perihilar areas
   - ACE level
   - f/u [**1-22**]-OH and 25-OH Vit D levels
   - speak w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who knows pt from previously
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 2.2 today from 3.2 (her baseline is 0.6-0.7).  [**Month (only) 8**] still
   be prerenal.  Abdominal US at [**Hospital1 2840**] showed no evidence of
   hydronephrosis.  Part of her ARF could also be due to the direct renal
   vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia on the kidney causing a fall
   in the GFR.
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Right posterior hip pain:
   The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, Xrays have not been
   helpful.  On exam she has no evidence of weakness or neuro findings.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to metastases or pain for positional changes. Pt also
   has left knee pain.
   - need Bone Scan this week to evaluate for metastatic/malignant lesions
   - Consider pelvis CT to evaluate the soft tissue around the hip for
   source of the pain.
   - Morphine for pain control
 consider switching to a different PO med,
   though pt feels that she had recently been having more difficulty
   swallowing recently
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:
   The patient has a mildly elevated AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase.
   Pancreatitis is a uncommon side effect of hypercalcemia so her elevated
   lipase could be secondary to pancreatitis.  Improving slowly
   - Trend LFTs/lipase
   - advance diet slowly
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids.  She is a
   Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not want tranfusion of any type
   of blood products.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Guaiac stools given history of black stool.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  The patient is s/p excision in
   [**7-6**].  She had discussed radiation treatment, but had opted against
   it.  Her current presenatation of hypercalcemia is concerning for
   reoccurance of her squamous cell carcinoma.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 15 yesterday from 19 on admission that morning, but is
   increasing again to 16 this AM.  Squamous cell carcinomas of the lung
   and head and neck are known to produce PTH-rP so her SSC of the skin
   could possibly produce this.  This could also be secondary to bony mets
   ; she does have elevated Alk Phos.  Another possibility on differential
   is sarcoidosis because of increased peri-hilar densities.  PTH is
   normal level, but should be lower with such high calcium
   - IVF hydration continued.  Urine output 400cc/hr.  will start Normal
   Saline today for a few liters, then return to LR.  Once she appears
   euvolemic, will aim for UOP of 100-150 cc/hr.
   - lasix [**Hospital1 **] to lessen overall edema and fluid in lungs, possibly to
   help w Ca as well
   - Avoid calcitonin bc of allergic reaction, but ask endo about
   premedicating for calcitonin
   - f/u Endocrine Recs
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u  PTHrP  ,  Vit D
   - Bone Scan on weekday
   - Bowel regimen for constipation and zofran prn for nausea.
   - consider Hemodialysis if Ca cannot be decreased
   - f/u w Renal recs
   .
   # Perihilar densities:
   [**Month (only) 8**] be malignant spread to lymph nodes or sarcoidosis.
   - Chest CT today to evaluate perihilar areas
   - ACE level
   - f/u [**1-22**]-OH and 25-OH Vit D levels
   - speak w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who knows pt from previously
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 2.2 today from 3.2 (her baseline is 0.6-0.7).  [**Month (only) 8**] still
   be prerenal.  Abdominal US at [**Hospital1 2840**] showed no evidence of
   hydronephrosis.  Part of her ARF could also be due to the direct renal
   vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia on the kidney causing a fall
   in the GFR.
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Right posterior hip pain:
   The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, Xrays have not been
   helpful.  On exam she has no evidence of weakness or neuro findings.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to metastases or pain for positional changes. Pt also
   has left knee pain.
   - need Bone Scan this week to evaluate for metastatic/malignant lesions
   - Consider pelvis CT to evaluate the soft tissue around the hip for
   source of the pain.
   - Morphine for pain control
 consider switching to a different PO med,
   though pt feels that she had recently been having more difficulty
   swallowing recently
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:
   The patient has a mildly elevated AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase.
   Pancreatitis is a uncommon side effect of hypercalcemia so her elevated
   lipase could be secondary to pancreatitis.  Improving slowly
   - Trend LFTs/lipase
   - advance diet slowly
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids.  She is a
   Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not want tranfusion of any type
   of blood products.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Guaiac stools given history of black stool.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  The patient is s/p excision in
   [**7-6**].  She had discussed radiation treatment, but had opted against
   it.  Her current presenatation of hypercalcemia is concerning for
   reoccurance of her squamous cell carcinoma.
   - Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] about his perspective regarding her cancer status

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are increasing, which can lead to further complications such as renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and neuromuscular symptoms.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, which can lead to further kidney damage and potential need for dialysis.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary nodules can lead to respiratory distress and potential need for intubation.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and recent surgery make her susceptible to infections, particularly pneumonia and sepsis.
5. Metastatic Disease: The patient's metastatic squamous cell carcinoma can lead to further spread of disease to other organs, including the liver, bones, and brain.
6. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's chronic iron-deficiency anemia and history of malnutrition can lead to further nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin D and calcium deficiencies.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of constipation and nausea can lead to further gastrointestinal complications, including bowel obstruction and pancreatitis.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypercalcemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and potential cardiac arrest.
9. Neurological Complications: The patient's hypercalcemia can also lead to neurological symptoms, including confusion, lethargy, and seizures.
10. Bleeding Complications: The patient's history of bleeding and recent surgery make her susceptible to further bleeding complications, including hemorrhage and anemia.

Based on the patient's current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to identify any potential complications and address them promptly. Additionally, the patient's oncologist and other healthcare providers should be consulted to develop a comprehensive treatment plan to manage her hypercalcemia, metastatic disease, and other comorbidities."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   2. Subcutaneous new left lower quadrant and left inguinal nodular
   opacities, all these findings are concerning for progression of
   neoplastic disease.
   3. A small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.
   CT Chest (Prelim read):  1. Marked progression of extensive bilateral
   pulmonary nodules with large hilar masses inseparable from mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy. Overall, these hilar masses inseparable from
   mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Overall, these findings are new since [**Month (only) 1646**]
   and concerning for rapid progression of neoplastic disease in a person
   with known history of previous malignancy.
   2. New bilateral pleural effusions.
   3. Inadequately characterized hepatic hypodensities.
   4. Cholelithiasis
   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 14.1 yesterday evening, patient refused labs overnight
   and this morning nursing and IV nurse were unable to draw labs or place
   a new peripheral, put patient in for a PICC.  CT scan showed concern
   for progression of malignancy with innumerable pulmonary nodules, hilar
   masses, bony lesions in the iliac bones bilaterally and left inguinal
   enlarging LAD.  Given new CT scan findings the most likely etiology is
   recurrence of her metastatic disease.
   Squamous cell carcinomas of the lung and head and neck are known to
   produce PTH-rP so her SSC of the skin could possibly produce this.
   This could also be secondary to bony mets ; she does have elevated Alk
   Phos.  Another possibility on differential is sarcoidosis because of
   increased peri-hilar densities.  PTH is normal level, but should be
   lower with such high calcium
   - IVF hydration continued.  Urine output 400cc/hr.  will start Normal
   Saline today for a few liters, then return to LR.  Once she appears
   euvolemic, will aim for UOP of 100-150 cc/hr.
   - lasix [**Hospital1 **] to lessen overall edema and fluid in lungs, possibly to
   help w Ca as well
   - Avoid calcitonin bc of allergic reaction, but ask endo about
   premedicating for calcitonin
   - f/u Endocrine Recs
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u  PTHrP  ,  Vit D
   - Bone Scan on weekday
   - Bowel regimen for constipation and zofran prn for nausea.
   - consider Hemodialysis if Ca cannot be decreased
   - f/u w Renal recs
   .
   # Perihilar densities:
   [**Month (only) 8**] be malignant spread to lymph nodes or sarcoidosis.
   - Chest CT today to evaluate perihilar areas
   - ACE level
   - f/u [**1-22**]-OH and 25-OH Vit D levels
   - speak w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who knows pt from previously
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 2.2 today from 3.2 (her baseline is 0.6-0.7).  [**Month (only) 8**] still
   be prerenal.  Abdominal US at [**Hospital1 2840**] showed no evidence of
   hydronephrosis.  Part of her ARF could also be due to the direct renal
   vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia on the kidney causing a fall
   in the GFR.
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Right posterior hip pain:
   The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, Xrays have not been
   helpful.  On exam she has no evidence of weakness or neuro findings.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to metastases or pain for positional changes. Pt also
   has left knee pain.
   - need Bone Scan this week to evaluate for metastatic/malignant lesions
   - Consider pelvis CT to evaluate the soft tissue around the hip for
   source of the pain.
   - Morphine for pain control
 consider switching to a different PO med,
   though pt feels that she had recently been having more difficulty
   swallowing recently
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:
   The patient has a mildly elevated AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase.
   Pancreatitis is a uncommon side effect of hypercalcemia so her elevated
   lipase could be secondary to pancreatitis.  Improving slowly
   - Trend LFTs/lipase
   - advance diet slowly
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids.  She is a
   Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not want tranfusion of any type
   of blood products.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Guaiac stools given history of black stool.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  The patient is s/p excision in
   [**7-6**].  She had discussed radiation treatment, but had opted against
   it.  Her current presenatation of hypercalcemia is concerning for
   reoccurance of her squamous cell carcinoma.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Complications:
	* The patient has marked progression of extensive bilateral pulmonary nodules with large hilar masses inseparable from mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which can lead to respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening respiratory failure.
	* The patient's pleural effusions may worsen, causing further respiratory compromise.
2. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* The patient's hypercalcemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, and cardiac failure.
	* The patient's elevated Alk Phos levels may indicate liver dysfunction, which can exacerbate cardiac complications.
3. Renal Complications:
	* The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
	* The patient's elevated creatinine levels may indicate ongoing kidney damage, which can be irreversible.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* The patient's elevated lipase levels may indicate pancreatitis, which can lead to severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
	* The patient's history of black stool and chronic iron-deficiency anemia may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding or malabsorption.
5. Metastatic Complications:
	* The patient's metastatic squamous cell carcinoma may progress, leading to further organ damage and potentially life-threatening complications.
	* The patient's bone lesions may worsen, causing pain, weakness, and potentially leading to pathological fractures.
6. Infectious Complications:
	* The patient's immunosuppressed state may increase the risk of infections, particularly respiratory and urinary tract infections.
7. Nutritional Complications:
	* The patient's poor appetite and history of constipation may indicate malnutrition, which can worsen overall health and increase the risk of complications.

Based on these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent or mitigate these complications. The patient's treatment plan should focus on controlling hypercalcemia, managing respiratory distress, and addressing other potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma who presents with hypercalcemia and acute renal failure (ARF). She has undergone prior excision and has innumerable lung nodules, large pelvic lymphadenopathy, and lytic lesions on chest and pelvic CT scans. She has been treated with lasix and aggressive intravenous fluids (IVFs) with improvement in calcium levels. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure of 196/102 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute. She has a history of constipation, mild hyponatremia, leukocytosis, anxiety, anemia, and non-gap metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercalcemia-induced cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's hypercalcemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, which could be life-threatening.
2. Acute kidney injury progression: The patient's ARF may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further kidney damage or even renal failure.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's lung nodules and pleural effusions may lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, or respiratory distress syndrome.
4. Sepsis: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of lytic lesions may increase her risk of developing sepsis.
5. Anemia and bleeding: The patient's anemia and history of metastatic disease may increase her risk of bleeding, particularly in the context of invasive procedures or trauma.
6. Constipation and bowel obstruction: The patient's constipation may worsen and lead to bowel obstruction, which could be life-threatening.
7. Nephrotoxicity: The patient's use of nephrotoxic medications, such as lasix, may worsen her kidney function and increase her risk of acute kidney injury.
8. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of invasive devices, such as central lines and urinary catheters, may increase her risk of developing infections.
9. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of metastatic disease and hypercalcemia may increase her risk of developing cardiac complications, such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrhythmias.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications, close monitoring and multidisciplinary care are necessary to manage her condition and prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with metastatic squamous cell cancer, presenting with hypercalcemia, constipation, mild hyponatremia, anxiety, acute renal failure, and anemia. The patient is currently in the ICU, receiving IV fluids and medications to manage her condition.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, and blood pressure of 196/102 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 23 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 97%. Her laboratory results show mild anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and hyponatremia.

The patient has multiple lung nodules and a large inguinal lymph node on chest and pelvic CT scans. She has also been diagnosed with pleural effusions and small bilateral effusions. Her hypercalcemia is suspected to be related to her metastatic disease.

The patient's plan includes continuing IV normal saline, decreasing IV fluid rate, and following her electrolyte levels closely. She is also scheduled for a bone scan for additional staging evaluation and a pelvic CT to evaluate her hip pain.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Dehydration: The patient is receiving IV fluids, and her fluid balance is being closely monitored. However, there is a risk of dehydration if her IV fluids are not administered correctly.
2. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels are being monitored closely, but there is a risk of electrolyte imbalances if her IV fluids are not properly managed.
3. Renal failure: The patient is already experiencing acute renal failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration if her condition is not managed properly.
4. Infection: The patient has multiple lines and tubes in place, which increases her risk of infection.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient has pleural effusions and small bilateral effusions, which can increase her risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypercalcemia can cause cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure, and her anemia can increase her risk of cardiovascular complications.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is experiencing constipation, which can lead to nutritional deficiencies if not managed properly.
8. Psychological complications: The patient is experiencing anxiety, which can worsen if not managed properly.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these potential complications and ensure her safe transition to the oncology floor."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - double lumen PICC line placed morning of [**10-10**]
   - still very anxious ; responds well to ativan
   - Bone Scan today by Nuclear Medicine
   - Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] stopped by in evening.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] told her it is
   most likely metastatic cancer.  He thinks we need a tissue biopsy,
   possibly just from medial leg (which he thinks is likely the same as
   what is in the lungs)
   - was called out to OMED ---> but we kept her b/c of her very elevated
   BPs and HRs
   - intensified bowel regimen --> patient had multiple BM
   - Patient has been having increasing tachycardia all night, up to 130s,
   appears to be in sinus rhythm -- tried fluid boluses, tried
   anti-anxiety (ativan), which have not improved it ; consider also PE,
   though not strong enough suspicion to start heparin (cannot give her
   contrast for scan); consider also SVT? though looks like sinus rhythm
   - also has been having increasing BPs, consistently around 190/100-->
   gave IV hydralazine acutely; PO hydral did not seem to have much
   effect, so started labetalol low-dose (200mg [**Hospital1 **]) which helped both HR
   and BP... though the concern was not to mask whatever was causing the
   tachycardia
   - pt does have dropping O2 sat to low 90s when sleeping; patient
   snoring so concern for sleep apnea
   - DCed lasix

   Other labs:
   Ca: 11.8,  Mg: 2.0,   Phos: 3.1
   TSH: 2.2
   Imaging:
   CT Pelvis:  IMPRESSION: 1. New lytic lesions throughout the pelvis and
   new subcutaneous left lower quadrant and left inguinal nodules, all
   indicative of marked progression of metastatic disease.
   2. Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.
   3. Diverticulosis
   CT Chest: IMPRESSION: 1. Marked progression of extensive bilateral
   pulmonary nodules with large hilar masses inseparable from mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy as well as numerous ossesous lytic lesions. Overall,
   these findings are new since [**Month (only) 1646**] and concerning for rapid progression
   of neoplastic disease in a person with known history of previous
   malignancy.
   2. Expansile lesion posteriorly at the T10 veterbral body with
   associated narrowing of the central canal
   3. New bilateral pleural effusions.
   4. Inadequately characterized hepatic hypodensities.
   5. Cholelithiasis.
   Bone Scan: IMPRESSION: 1. Known T10 vertebral body and pelvic osseous
   metastases do not demonstrate significant tracer avidity. 2. Marked
   right upper thoracic anterior chest wall uptake does not have an
   obvious CT correlate, though early rib/chest wall metastasis is a
   diagnostic consideration. 3. Bilateral femoral shaft uptake may reflect
   hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. 4. Difficult to exclude a
   skull metastasis in the setting of mild focal uptake.
   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 11.8 today with continued IV hydration at a lower rate,
   she continues to have brisk urine output, even with the discontinuation
   of the lasix.  CT scan concerning for progression of malignancy with
   innumerable pulmonary nodules, hilar masses, bony lesions in the iliac
   bones bilaterally and left inguinal enlarging LAD, which is the most
   likely cause of her hypercalcemia.
   - Decreased IVF rate to 150cc/hr since her calcium has been improving
   and she is LOS up about 9L of fluid, also discontinued lasix as her
   urine output has remained brisk and calcium is down to 11.8.
   - Renal function improving with IVF and decreasing calcium
   - Bone Scan: shows known bony mets, but also with concern for possible
   mets to the chest wall, possible skull mets, and femoral hypertrophic
   pulmonary osteoarthropathy.
   - Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] came by to see the patient, and spoke with
   her about her metastatic disease, patient will go to the oncology floor
   when she leaves the ICU for further management
   - constipation related to hypercalcemia has resolved with aggressive
   bowel regimen, will continue bowel regimen as patient also continues to
   receive narcotics
   - Mildly elevated Alk Phos from her bony mets
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u  PTHrP , Vit D, ACE level
   - Renal and Endocrine following, appreciate recs
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 1.9 today from 3.2 on admission (her baseline is
   0.6-0.7), most likely due to her hypercalemia, renal function is
   improving with decreased calcium and continued hydration
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins
No NSAIDS
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia: initially thought to be due to anxiety/pain
   and dehydration, which may still be playing a role, however ativan has
   not really helped, and patient has been aggressively hydrated with
   IVF
s.  In discussion with her husband, it sounds like she was
   hypertensive prior to admission (SBP
s in the 150
s) but not on any
   medications, which may be exacerbated by the stress of the hospital.
   - EKG showed Sinus Tachycardia
 no response to ativan, morhpine, IVF
   - Started labetalol for BP and HR control with some effect, BP may also
   improve with decrease in total body volume
   # Right posterior hip pain:  The patient has focal iliac crest pain on
   exam, has lytic lesions on CT scan
   - Morphine for pain control, small doses have currently been working
   well but will transition to po oxycodone liquid as patient has
   difficulty swallowing pills
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids, and has
   remained stable.  She is a Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not
   want tranfusion of any type of blood products.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  Hypercalcemia and imaging are
   very concerning for worsening metastatic disease,  per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will
   consult IR for biopsy of one of the lesions in her iliac bones
   - patient for transfer to OMED when she leaves ICU for further
   management

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - double lumen PICC line placed morning of [**10-10**]
   - still very anxious ; responds well to ativan
   - Bone Scan today by Nuclear Medicine
   - Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] stopped by in evening.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] told her it is
   most likely metastatic cancer.  He thinks we need a tissue biopsy,
   possibly just from medial leg (which he thinks is likely the same as
   what is in the lungs)
   - was called out to OMED ---> but we kept her b/c of her very elevated
   BPs and HRs
   - intensified bowel regimen --> patient had multiple BM
   - Patient has been having increasing tachycardia all night, up to 130s,
   appears to be in sinus rhythm -- tried fluid boluses, tried
   anti-anxiety (ativan), which have not improved it ; consider also PE,
   though not strong enough suspicion to start heparin (cannot give her
   contrast for scan); consider also SVT? though looks like sinus rhythm
   - also has been having increasing BPs, consistently around 190/100-->
   gave IV hydralazine acutely; PO hydral did not seem to have much
   effect, so started labetalol low-dose (200mg [**Hospital1 **]) which helped both HR
   and BP... though the concern was not to mask whatever was causing the
   tachycardia
   - pt does have dropping O2 sat to low 90s when sleeping; patient
   snoring so concern for sleep apnea
   - DCed lasix

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid medial thigh, admitted with hypercalcemia (19.8) and a baseline calcium level of 0.6-0.7. Her condition has progressed rapidly, with new lytic lesions throughout the pelvis, subcutaneous left lower quadrant and left inguinal nodules, and bilateral pulmonary nodules. She has also developed acute renal failure, hypertension, and tachycardia.

The patient has been receiving IV hydration, which has improved her calcium levels, and her renal function is improving. She has been treated with ativan for anxiety, but it has not had a significant effect on her tachycardia. Labetalol has been started for BP and HR control, with some effect.

The patient's medical history includes chronic iron-deficiency anemia, and she is a Jehovah's Witness, refusing blood transfusions. She has also been experiencing constipation, which has resolved with aggressive bowel regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Progressive metastatic disease: The patient's condition is rapidly progressing, with new lesions appearing on imaging studies. This may lead to further complications, such as organ failure or spinal cord compression.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's Cr levels have improved, but she is still at risk for further renal damage due to her underlying disease and treatment.
3. Hypertension and tachycardia: The patient's BP and HR remain elevated, and she may require further treatment to control these symptoms.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are still elevated, and she may require further treatment to manage this condition.
5. Constipation: The patient's constipation has resolved with aggressive bowel regimen, but she may require ongoing management to prevent recurrence.
6. Iron-deficiency anemia: The patient's Hct levels are stable, but she may require ongoing treatment to manage her anemia.
7. Potential for bleeding: The patient's metastatic disease may cause bleeding, particularly if she develops lesions in her lungs or gastrointestinal tract.
8. Potential for respiratory compromise: The patient's metastatic disease may cause respiratory compromise, particularly if she develops lesions in her lungs or mediastinum.
9. Potential for neurological compromise: The patient's metastatic disease may cause neurological compromise, particularly if she develops lesions in her brain or spinal cord.

ICU Care Plan:

1. Continue IV hydration to manage hypercalcemia and acute renal failure.
2. Monitor BP and HR closely, and adjust treatment as necessary to control these symptoms.
3. Continue aggressive bowel regimen to manage constipation.
4. Monitor calcium levels closely, and adjust treatment as necessary to manage hypercalcemia.
5. Continue IVF at a rate of 150cc/hr, and monitor the patient's fluid status closely.
6. Consider consulting IR for biopsy of one of the lesions in her iliac bones to further evaluate her metastatic disease.
7. Plan for transfer to OMED when the patient leaves the ICU for further management.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function, and adjust treatment as necessary to manage acute renal failure.
9. Consider consulting oncology for further management of the patient's metastatic disease."

   Ca: 11.8,  Mg: 2.0,   Phos: 3.1
   TSH: 2.2
   Imaging:
   CT Pelvis:  IMPRESSION: 1. New lytic lesions throughout the pelvis and
   new subcutaneous left lower quadrant and left inguinal nodules, all
   indicative of marked progression of metastatic disease.
   2. Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.
   3. Diverticulosis
   CT Chest: IMPRESSION: 1. Marked progression of extensive bilateral
   pulmonary nodules with large hilar masses inseparable from mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy as well as numerous ossesous lytic lesions. Overall,
   these findings are new since [**Month (only) 1646**] and concerning for rapid progression
   of neoplastic disease in a person with known history of previous
   malignancy.
   2. Expansile lesion posteriorly at the T10 veterbral body with
   associated narrowing of the central canal
   3. New bilateral pleural effusions.
   4. Inadequately characterized hepatic hypodensities.
   5. Cholelithiasis.
   Bone Scan: IMPRESSION: 1. Known T10 vertebral body and pelvic osseous
   metastases do not demonstrate significant tracer avidity. 2. Marked
   right upper thoracic anterior chest wall uptake does not have an
   obvious CT correlate, though early rib/chest wall metastasis is a
   diagnostic consideration. 3. Bilateral femoral shaft uptake may reflect
   hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. 4. Difficult to exclude a
   skull metastasis in the setting of mild focal uptake.
   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 11.8 today with continued IV hydration at a lower rate,
   she continues to have brisk urine output, even with the discontinuation
   of the lasix.  CT scan concerning for progression of malignancy with
   innumerable pulmonary nodules, hilar masses, bony lesions in the iliac
   bones bilaterally and left inguinal enlarging LAD, which is the most
   likely cause of her hypercalcemia.
   - Decreased IVF rate to 150cc/hr since her calcium has been improving
   and she is LOS up about 9L of fluid, also discontinued lasix as her
   urine output has remained brisk and calcium is down to 11.8.
   - Renal function improving with IVF and decreasing calcium
   - Bone Scan: shows known bony mets, but also with concern for possible
   mets to the chest wall, possible skull mets, and femoral hypertrophic
   pulmonary osteoarthropathy.
   - Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] came by to see the patient yesterday, and
   spoke with her about her metastatic disease, patient will go to the
   oncology floor when she leaves the ICU for further management
   - constipation related to hypercalcemia has resolved with aggressive
   bowel regimen, will continue bowel regimen as patient also continues to
   receive narcotics
   - Mildly elevated Alk Phos from her bony mets
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u  PTHrP , Vit D, ACE level
   - Renal and Endocrine following, appreciate recs
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 1.9 today from 3.2 on admission (her baseline is
   0.6-0.7), most likely due to her hypercalemia, renal function is
   improving with decreased calcium and continued hydration
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins
No NSAIDS
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia: initially thought to be due to anxiety/pain
   and dehydration, which may still be playing a role, however ativan has
   not really helped, and patient has been aggressively hydrated with
   IVF
s.  In discussion with her husband, it sounds like she was
   hypertensive prior to admission (SBP
s in the 150
s) but not on any
   medications, which may be exacerbated by the stress of the hospital.
   - EKG showed Sinus Tachycardia
 no response to ativan, morhpine, IVF
   - Started labetalol for BP and HR control with some effect
   # Right posterior hip pain:  The patient has focal iliac crest pain on
   exam, has lytic lesions on CT scan
   - Morphine for pain control, small doses have currently been working
   well.
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:  LFT
s have normalized except for a mildy
   elevated Alk Phos, related to bony mets
   - patient currently tolerating a regular diet without difficulty
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids, and has
   remained stable.  She is a Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not
   want tranfusion of any type of blood products.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  Hypercalcemia and imaging are
   very concerning for worsening metastatic disease, patient for transfer
   to OMED when she leaves ICU for further management

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - double lumen PICC line placed morning of [**10-10**]
   - still very anxious ; responds well to ativan
   - Bone Scan today by Nuclear Medicine
   - Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] stopped by in evening.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] told her it is
   most likely metastatic cancer.  He thinks we need a tissue biopsy,
   possibly just from medial leg (which he thinks is likely the same as
   what is in the lungs)
   - was called out to OMED ---> but we kept her b/c of her very elevated
   BPs and HRs
   - intensified bowel regimen --> patient has been stooling all
   afternoon/evening
   - Patient has been having increasing tachycardia all night, up to 130s,
   appears to be in sinus rhythm -- tried fluid boluses, tried
   anti-anxiety (ativan), which have not improved it ; consider also PE,
   though not strong enough suspicion to start heparin (cannot give her
   contrast for scan); consider also SVT? though looks like sinus rhythm
   - also has been having increasing BPs, consistently around 190/100-->
   gave IV hydralazine acutely; PO hydral did not seem to have much
   effect, so started labetalol low-dose (200mg [**Hospital1 **]) which helped both HR
   and BP... though the concern was not to mask whatever was causing the
   tachycardia
   - pt does have dropping O2 sat to low 90s when sleeping; may be related
   to orthopnea, pleural effusions, ?sleep apnea
   - DCed lasix

   likely cause of her hypercalcemia.
   - Decreased IVF rate to 150cc/hr since her calcium has been improving
   and she is LOS up about 9L of fluid, also discontinued lasix as her
   urine output has remained brisk and calcium is down to 11.8.
   - Renal function improving with IVF and decreasing calcium
   - Bone Scan: shows known bony mets, but also with concern for possible
   mets to the chest wall, possible skull mets, and femoral hypertrophic
   pulmonary osteoarthropathy.
   - Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] came by to see the patient yesterday, and
   spoke with her about her metastatic disease, patient will go to the
   oncology floor when she leaves the ICU for further management
   - constipation related to hypercalcemia has resolved with aggressive
   bowel regimen, will continue bowel regimen as patient also continues to
   receive narcotics
   - Mildly elevated Alk Phos from her bony mets
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u  PTHrP , Vit D, ACE level
   - Renal and Endocrine following, appreciate recs
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 1.9 today from 3.2 on admission (her baseline is
   0.6-0.7), most likely due to her hypercalemia, renal function is
   improving with decreased calcium and continued hydration
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins
No NSAIDS
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia: initially thought to be due to anxiety/pain
   and dehydration, which may still be playing a role, however ativan has
   not really helped, and patient has been aggressively hydrated with
   IVF
s.  In discussion with her husband, it sounds like she was
   hypertensive prior to admission (SBP
s in the 150
s) but not on any
   medications, which may be exacerbated by the stress of the hospital.
   - EKG showed Sinus Tachycardia
 no response to ativan, morhpine, IVF
   - Started labetalol for BP and HR control with some effect
   # Right posterior hip pain:  The patient has focal iliac crest pain on
   exam, has lytic lesions on CT scan
   - Morphine for pain control, small doses have currently been working
   well.
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:  LFT
s have normalized except for a mildy
   elevated Alk Phos, related to bony mets
   - patient currently tolerating a regular diet without difficulty
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids, and has
   remained stable.  She is a Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not
   want tranfusion of any type of blood products.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  Hypercalcemia and imaging are
   very concerning for worsening metastatic disease, patient for transfer
   to OMED when she leaves ICU for further management

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid medial thigh, s/p excision in July. She was admitted with hypercalcemia (Ca 19.8) and has been treated with IV hydration, lasix, and pamidronate. Her calcium levels have decreased to 11.8, and her renal function is improving. She has also been experiencing tachycardia, hypertension, and right posterior hip pain, which may be related to her underlying disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Progressive metastatic disease: The patient's imaging studies show worsening metastatic disease, which may lead to further complications such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and bone pain.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved, but she is still at risk for acute renal failure due to her underlying disease and potential nephrotoxicity from medications.
3. Hypertension and tachycardia: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia may be related to her underlying disease, anxiety, and dehydration. She may require further treatment with medications such as beta blockers and diuretics.
4. Right posterior hip pain: The patient's focal iliac crest pain may be related to her underlying disease and may require further treatment with pain medications and physical therapy.
5. Elevated LFTs and lipase: The patient's mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase levels may be related to her underlying disease and may require further monitoring.
6. Chronic iron-deficiency anemia: The patient's anemia may be related to her underlying disease and may require further treatment with iron supplements and blood transfusions.
7. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma: The patient's metastatic disease may require further treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or surgical resection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IV hydration and lasix to manage hypercalcemia and improve renal function.
2. Monitor the patient's calcium levels and adjust her treatment as needed.
3. Consider further treatment with medications such as beta blockers and diuretics to manage hypertension and tachycardia.
4. Provide pain management with medications such as morphine and physical therapy to manage right posterior hip pain.
5. Monitor the patient's LFTs and lipase levels and adjust her treatment as needed.
6. Consider further treatment with iron supplements and blood transfusions to manage chronic iron-deficiency anemia.
7. Transfer the patient to the oncology floor for further management of her metastatic disease."
