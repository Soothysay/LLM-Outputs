   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIA OTHER
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 .H/O DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
   This is a 53 year old male with a history of type II DM, CAD s/p CABG
   who presents with sepsis.
   # Sepsis - Patient meets SIRS criteria with WBC, fever, HR, and initial
   PaCO2.  Likely source is pneumonia +/ skin infection +/ c.diff
   colitis.
   - Treat empirically for pneumonia with vanc, zosyn, levoflox
   - Sputum cxs, urine legionella Ag
   - Treat empirically for c.diff colitis with flagyl
   - Check c.diff toxin
   - KUB to evaluate for toxic megacolon/perforation
   - Check plain films of right foot to r/o extension into bone
   - Vanco and zosyn should also cover for diabetic foot ulcer
   - Arterial line for close hemodynamic monitoring
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve.
   .
   # WCT - Concerning for VT versus SVT with aberrancy.  Currently in NSR
   on amiodarone gtt.  Of note QTc prolonged, will need to monitor, esp on
   levofloxacin.
   - Cycle cardiac markers
   - ECG in AM
   - Continue amiodarone for now
   - Cardiology c/s in AM
   .
   # Respiratory - Intubated for lethargy and ? acidosis.
   - A-line
   - ABG
   - Wean O2 as needed
   - Pressure support tomorrow if hemodynamics improved
   .
   # DKA - Secondary to infection.  AG now closed.  Will continue on
   insulin gtt for now given very elevated FSGs.
   - Continue insulin gtt for now
   - Q2 hour FSG checks
   - Correct electrolytes
   - Change to ISS when FSG improved
   .
   # Hyponatremia - Maybe secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of
   diarrhea.  Legionella also possible.
   - Urine lytes, osm
   - Cont trend following hydration
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Sepsis is possible etiology.  Too early to be
   HIT.
   - Check DIC labs
   - Meds reviewed
   - Obtain baseline plt count
   .
   # FEN:  NPO
   .
   # Access: OSH femoral line, needs to be replaced in AM

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   This is a 53 year old male with a history of type II DM, CAD s/p CABG
   who presents with sepsis.
   # Sepsis - Patient meets SIRS criteria with WBC, fever, HR, and initial
   PaCO2.  Likely source is pneumonia +/ skin infection +/ c.diff
   colitis.
   - Treat empirically for pneumonia with vanc, zosyn, levoflox
   - Sputum cxs, urine legionella Ag
   - Treat empirically for c.diff colitis with flagyl
   - Check c.diff toxin
   - KUB to evaluate for toxic megacolon/perforation
   - Check plain films of right foot to r/o extension into bone
   - Vanco and zosyn should also cover for diabetic foot ulcer
   - Arterial line for close hemodynamic monitoring
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve.
   .
   # WCT - Concerning for VT versus SVT with aberrancy.  Currently in NSR
   on amiodarone gtt.  Of note QTc prolonged, will need to monitor, esp on
   levofloxacin.
   - Cycle cardiac markers
   - ECG in AM
   - Continue amiodarone for now
   - Cardiology c/s in AM

   # Respiratory - Intubated for lethargy and ? acidosis.
   - A-line
   - ABG
   - Wean O2 as needed
   - Pressure support tomorrow if hemodynamics improved

   # DKA - Secondary to infection.  AG now closed.  Will continue on
   insulin gtt for now given very elevated FSGs.
   - Continue insulin gtt for now
   - Q2 hour FSG checks
   - Correct electrolytes
   - Change to ISS when FSG improved
   .
   # Hyponatremia - Maybe secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of
   diarrhea.  Legionella also possible.
   - Urine lytes, osm
   - Cont trend following hydration

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II DM, CAD s/p CABG, who presents with sepsis. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, acute, and is intubated for lethargy and potential acidosis.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including bronchoscopy, arterial line placement, and multi-lumen catheter insertion. The patient's blood cultures have grown Group B beta strep, and the BAL showed clean lungs.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated LDH, but haptoglobin is normal. The patient's electrolytes are abnormal, with hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypomagnesemia. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, with a prolonged QTc interval.

The patient's medical conditions include sepsis, severe, with organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, acute, not ARDS, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

The patient's plan of care includes empiric treatment for pneumonia with vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and levofloxacin, as well as treatment for c.diff colitis with metronidazole. The patient's insulin infusion will be continued, and his FSG will be monitored. The patient's electrolytes will be corrected, and his platelet count will be monitored.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction
3. Respiratory failure requiring increased ventilatory support
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) requiring insulin adjustment
5. Thrombocytopenia requiring platelet transfusion
6. Hyponatremia requiring careful fluid management
7. Prolonged QTc interval requiring cardiac monitoring
8. Infection-related cardiac arrhythmias
9. Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and anticoagulation therapy
10. Potential for multi-organ failure due to sepsis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided daily progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient, a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes, coronary artery disease, and a recent cardiac surgery, presents with sepsis, respiratory failure, and cardiac dysrhythmia. The patient's initial symptoms include fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, which progressed to respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient's cardiac condition includes a prolonged QTc interval and a wide complex tachycardia, which may be concerning for ventricular tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy.

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* Elevated white blood cell count (13.7 K/uL)
* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (945 IU/L)
* Elevated troponin-T (<0.01 ng/mL)
* Elevated creatinine (1.6 mg/dL)
* Elevated blood glucose (152 mg/dL)
* Elevated lactic acid (2.0 mmol/L)
* Thrombocytopenia (50 K/uL)

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction)
* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
* Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
* Hyponatremia (resolved)
* Thrombocytopenia (possible etiology: sepsis)

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Empirical treatment for pneumonia with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and cefepime
* Empirical treatment for c.diff colitis with metronidazole
* Insulin infusion for glycemic control
* Close hemodynamic monitoring
* Replacement of arterial line for close monitoring
* Follow-up blood, urine, and sputum cultures
* Trend WBC count and fever curve
* Weaning of ventilator as tolerated

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation
* Cardiac arrest
* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Respiratory failure
* Diabetic ketoacidosis
* Thrombocytopenia-related bleeding
* Infection-related complications (e.g., pneumonia, c.diff colitis)
* Cardiac dysrhythmia-related complications (e.g., prolonged QTc interval)

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as necessary to prevent these potential complications and ensure the patient's optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II DM, CAD, and s/p CABG who presents with sepsis, septic shock, wide complex VT, DKA, and thrombocytopenia. He was transferred from the operating room with a growing Group B strep infection in his blood. He is intubated and receiving levophed, and has undergone bronchoscopy and multi-lumen catheter placement. His vital signs are stable, but he is still critically ill. He has a prolonged QTc interval and will need to be monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related complications: The patient's sepsis is not fully controlled, and he may continue to experience fever, hypotension, and organ dysfunction.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's wide complex VT and prolonged QTc interval increase his risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases his risk of respiratory failure and respiratory acidosis.
4. DKA-related complications: The patient's DKA is not fully resolved, and he may continue to experience hyperglycemia, ketosis, and acidosis.
5. Thrombocytopenia-related complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia increases his risk of bleeding, particularly in the context of invasive procedures or trauma.
6. Infection-related complications: The patient's Group B strep infection may spread to other parts of his body, leading to sepsis, organ failure, or death.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's prolonged ICU stay may lead to nutritional deficiencies, including protein-calorie malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.
8. Skin breakdown: The patient's prolonged immobility and pressure ulcer risk may lead to skin breakdown and pressure ulcers.
9. Neurological complications: The patient's prolonged sedation and immobility may lead to neurological complications, including delirium, cognitive impairment, and muscle weakness."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus (DM2), coronary artery disease (CAD), and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) who presented to the intensive care unit (ICU) with septic shock, wide complex ventricular tachycardia (VT), and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

The patient has a positive blood culture for Group B strep, and the source of the infection is unclear. He was treated empirically with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole, and will have further cultures and sensitivity testing.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with a history of intubation for lethargy and acidosis. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 15, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's cardiovascular status is also concerning, with a history of wide complex VT and a recent cardiac catheterization (CABG). He has a central venous catheter (CVC) and an arterial line (AL) in place.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.7, hemoglobin (Hb) of 11.0 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) of 50 K/uL, and creatinine (Cr) of 1.4 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies show cardiomegaly, left lower lobe (LLL) and right middle lobe (RML) infiltrates, and a left effusion on chest X-ray (CXR). He also has a 2-cm endotracheal tube (ETT) in place.

The patient's plan of care includes ongoing treatment for sepsis, continued antibiotic therapy, and further monitoring of his respiratory and cardiovascular status. He will also require ongoing management of his diabetes and glycemic control.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury or liver dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Cardiovascular instability, including hypotension or arrhythmias.
4. Neurological complications, including seizures or encephalopathy.
5. Infection-related complications, such as endocarditis or bacteremia.
6. Metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
7. Nutritional deficiencies, including malnutrition or electrolyte imbalances.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent or treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes and coronary artery disease who was transferred to the ICU from the operating room with septic shock, wide complex ventricular tachycardia, and diabetic ketoacidosis. He has a group B strep infection in his blood culture, which is unclear in its source. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and has a central venous catheter and arterial line in place. He is also receiving antibiotics, vasopressors, and other medications to manage his condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is a life-threatening condition that can lead to organ failure, shock, and death. It is essential to continue aggressive antibiotic therapy and source control measures to prevent further complications.
2. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's wide complex ventricular tachycardia can lead to cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, and death. It is essential to continue monitoring his cardiac rhythm and to consider cardioversion or defibrillation if necessary.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's diabetic ketoacidosis can lead to severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and acidosis. It is essential to continue aggressive fluid and electrolyte management to prevent further complications.
4. Group B strep infection: The patient's group B strep infection can lead to sepsis, meningitis, and other complications. It is essential to continue antibiotic therapy and to consider further testing to determine the source of the infection.
5. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and he is at risk for cardiac arrest. It is essential to continue close monitoring of his cardiac rhythm and to be prepared to respond to any cardiac emergency.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is also unstable, and he is at risk for respiratory failure. It is essential to continue close monitoring of his respiratory status and to be prepared to respond to any respiratory emergency.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and paralysis can lead to neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, and spinal cord injury. It is essential to continue close monitoring of his neurological status and to be prepared to respond to any neurological emergency.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II DM, CAD s/p CABG, who presents with sepsis. He was intubated due to lethargy and suspected acidosis. The source of infection is unclear, but blood cultures grew Group B strep. The patient is being treated with PCN and has been weaned off vanc. He has respiratory failure and is on a ventilator. He also has wide complex rhythm, which is being monitored by the cardiology service. The patient had anion gap ketoacidosis on presentation, which has since closed. He has thrombocytopenia, which is likely secondary to sepsis, and is being monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis is likely to cause further organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver failure, or respiratory failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, requiring further interventions such as tracheostomy or non-invasive ventilation.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's wide complex rhythm and need for pressor support may indicate cardiovascular instability, which could worsen and lead to cardiac arrest.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's diabetes may worsen, leading to hyperglycemic crises or other complications.
6. Infection-related complications: The patient's infection may spread to other areas of the body, leading to complications such as pneumonia, UTI, or wound infections.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and recent CABG may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Renal failure: The patient's sepsis may cause acute kidney injury, which could worsen and lead to renal failure.

Based on the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to detect any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent worsening of his condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   53 year old male with a history of type II DM, CAD s/p CABG who
   presents with sepsis.
   # Sepsis
On admission, patient met SIRS criteria with WBC, fever, HR,
   and initial PaCO2.  Likely source is pneumonia +/ skin infection +/
   c.diff colitis.  Now, blood cx + in [**3-28**] bottles for Group B strep at
   OSH.  X rays [**2-6**] of both feet without evidence of osteo. Negative for
   influenza.
   - Treat empirically for pneumonia with vanc, levoflox,
   -Curbside ID today to discuss best tx for Grp B strep bacteremia.
   - Treat empirically for c.diff colitis with flagyl
   - Check c.diff toxin
   - need to replace Arterial line for close hemodynamic monitoring
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve.
   -On levo gtt with goal MAP >60. Check SVO2
   # Respiratory failure  - Intubated for lethargy and ? acidosis.
   Reintubated after self-extubated in early am [**2-7**].
   -Wean to PS as tolerated today after A line placed.
   -pull back ETT 1-2cm today.
   # Wide complex tachycardai - Concerning for VT versus SVT with
   aberrancy.  Currently in paced rhythm at 83 BPM.  Of note QTc prolonged
   [**2-6**], will need to monitor, esp on levofloxacin. ROMI completed [**2-6**].
   -          Cardiology c/s  done [**2-6**] and Amio gtt d/c

   recommendation
   -          Continue close monitoring.
   -          Avoid BB for rate control while hypotensive on pressor
   # DKA - Secondary to infection.  AG now closed.  Will continue on
   insulin gtt for now given very elevated FSGs.
   - Continue insulin gtt for now- titrated PRN
   - Q2 hour FSG checks
   - Correct electrolytes
   - Change to ISS when FSG improved
   # Hyponatremia - Maybe secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of
   diarrhea.  Legionella also possible.  Now resolved.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II DM, CAD s/p CABG, who presents with sepsis. He has been intubated for respiratory failure and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. His blood cultures grew Group B strep, and he is being treated empirically for pneumonia, c.diff colitis, and bacteremia. He has also been diagnosed with DKA, wide complex tachycardia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, requiring increased ventilator support or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
3. Wide Complex Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may progress to ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, leading to cardiac arrest.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
5. DKA: The patient's DKA may worsen, leading to further metabolic complications, such as acidosis, and potentially life-threatening conditions like cerebral edema.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may worsen, leading to seizures, coma, or even death.
7. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac status may deteriorate, leading to cardiac arrest, which could be fatal if not promptly treated.
8. Infection: The patient's infection may spread to other parts of his body, leading to further complications and potentially life-threatening conditions.
9. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction or failure, including renal, hepatic, or cardiovascular failure.
10. Mortality: The patient's condition is critical, and his mortality risk is high."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and septic shock, who was transferred from another hospital with wide complex ventricular tachycardia (VT), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and thrombocytopenia. He has a growing Group B strep infection in his blood, which is unclear in its source (oral vs endocarditis). The patient is currently receiving treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam, levofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, and his vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 106/57 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's growing Group B strep infection in his blood is a significant concern, and there is a risk of further complications, such as organ dysfunction, septic shock, and death.
2. Endocarditis: The unclear source of the infection raises the possibility of endocarditis, which could lead to further complications, such as valve damage, heart failure, and septic emboli.
3. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's wide complex VT is a concern, and there is a risk of further arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation, which could lead to cardiac arrest.
4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient's DKA is a complication of his DM2, and there is a risk of further complications, such as acidosis, hyperosmolar coma, and death.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is a concern, and there is a risk of further bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and death.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a concern, and there is a risk of further complications, such as respiratory arrest, pneumonia, and death.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's CAD and history of VT raise the possibility of further cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
8. Infection-Related Complications: The patient's sepsis and growing Group B strep infection raise the possibility of further infection-related complications, such as septic shock, organ dysfunction, and death."

If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and a history of septic shock, wide complex ventricular tachycardia, and diabetic ketoacidosis. He was transferred from an outside hospital and is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.2°F, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 106/57 mmHg. His respiratory status is also stable, with a respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100% on 30% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2).

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.7, a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, and a platelet count of 50,000/μL. His blood cultures have grown Group B strep, and he has been treated with piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a soft, non-tender abdomen, and his respiratory examination shows bilateral breath sounds with some diminished breath sounds at the left base. His cardiac examination shows a normal first and second heart sound, and his peripheral vascular examination shows no significant abnormalities.

The patient's medical issues include sepsis, wide complex ventricular tachycardia, and diabetic ketoacidosis. His plan includes continued treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin, weaning of levophed as tolerated, and further evaluation of his cardiac and respiratory status.

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

1. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis could lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, or respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of wide complex ventricular tachycardia and his current cardiac status make him at risk for further cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but he is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He may require further respiratory support or may develop respiratory failure.
4. Infection: The patient's blood cultures have grown Group B strep, and he is at risk for further infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and he is at risk for bleeding complications.
6. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's diabetic ketoacidosis could worsen if not properly managed.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and his current cardiac status make him at risk for further cardiovascular complications, including myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest."

   Microbiology: Wound cultures from feet bilaterally with group B strep.
   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old male with a history of type II DM, CAD s/p CABG who
   presents with sepsis.
   # Sepsis
On admission, patient met SIRS criteria with WBC, fever, HR,
   and initial PaCO2.    Original source is unclear though the  patient
   had 4/4 bottles positive for group B strep at [**Location (un) **].  The
   significance of the of this organism also being present at the site of
   the patient
s ulcers is unclear as these were probed and do not have
   deep tracks or purulence, and this could be a skin organism.  Pneumonia
   also unlikely given negative BAL and clear CXR.  No pyuria supporting
   urinary tract infection.
   - started PCN for strep on [**2-7**] (apprec ID reccs) and d/c
d vanc
   - will continue levo (day 1 = [**2201-2-6**]) for ?CAP but d/c flagyl as c.
   diff neg
   - TEE scheduled for Tuesday to r/o endocarditis (?new murmur on [**2-8**]
   though pt does have a history of valve surgery)
   -weaned off norepinephrine
   -speak to podiatry today about need for further imaging of foot in
   context of same organism isolated as from blood and ? osteomyelitis
   # Respiratory failure  - Intubated for lethargy and ?acidosis.
   Reintubated after self-extubated in early am [**2-7**].
   - Initial acidosis possibly metabolic as little indication of primary
   pulmonary process on BAL or imaging, still given unable to rule out
   infiltrate and quite ill at presentation are completing a five day
   course of levofloxacin for CAP today.  Patient maintaining oxygenation
   and ventilation adequately on pressure support but more tachypnic after
   put on SBT.  Likely significant volume overload contributing to
   respiratory distress
   -Given marginal BP
s will attempt to diurese today with furosemide drip
   aiming for UOP to get 1-1.5 L negative today if BP will tolerate (keep
   SBP
s >60)
   -Complete five day course of levofloxacin for CAP
   -SBT this PM and attempt extubation if ABG stable
   # Wide complex rhythm
 cardiology service consulted and determined that
   patient is a sensed and V paced.  Persistent tachycardia most likely
   due to infection, intermittent fever, and some degree of continued
   intravascular fluid depletion (despite total body volume overload).
   # Diabetes
 Patient had anion gap ketoacidosis on presentation in the
   setting of sepsis.  Gap has closed.  Patient put on standing insulin
   last PM for chronic hyperglycemia.
   - continue ISS and standing insulin, follow fingersticks and titrate as
   needed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old male with a history of type II DM, CAD s/p CABG who
   presents with sepsis.
   # Sepsis
On admission, patient met SIRS criteria with WBC, fever, HR,
   and initial PaCO2.    Original source is unclear though the  patient
   had 4/4 bottles positive for group B strep at [**Location (un) **].  The
   significance of the of this organism also being present at the site of
   the patient
s ulcers is unclear as these were probed and do not have
   deep tracks or purulence, and this could be a skin organism.  Pneumonia
   also unlikely given negative BAL and clear CXR.  No pyuria supporting
   urinary tract infection.
   - started PCN for strep on [**2-7**] (apprec ID reccs) and d/c
d vanc
   - will continue levo (day 1 = [**2201-2-6**]) for ?CAP but d/c flagyl as c.
   diff neg
   - TEE scheduled for Tuesday to r/o endocarditis (?new murmur on [**2-8**]
   though pt does have a history of valve surgery)
   -weaned off norepinephrine
   -speak to podiatry today about need for further imaging of foot in
   context of same organism isolated as from blood and ? osteomyelitis
   # Respiratory failure  - Intubated for lethargy and ?acidosis.
   Reintubated after self-extubated in early am [**2-7**].
   - Initial acidosis possibly metabolic as little indication of primary
   pulmonary process on BAL or imaging, still given unable to rule out
   infiltrate and quite ill at presentation are completing a five day
   course of levofloxacin for CAP today.  Patient maintaining oxygenation
   and ventilation adequately on pressure support but more tachypnic after
   put on SBT.  Likely significant volume overload contributing to
   respiratory distress
   -Given marginal BP
s will attempt to diurese today with furosemide drip
   aiming for UOP to get 1-1.5 L negative today if BP will tolerate (keep
   SBP
s >60)
   -Complete five day course of levofloxacin for CAP
   -SBT this PM and attempt extubation if ABG stable
   # Wide complex rhythm
 cardiology service consulted and determined that
   patient is a sensed and V paced.  Persistent tachycardia most likely
   due to infection, intermittent fever, and some degree of continued
   intravascular fluid depletion (despite total body volume overload).
   # Diabetes
 Patient had anion gap ketoacidosis on presentation in the
   setting of sepsis.  Gap has closed.  Patient put on standing insulin
   last PM for chronic hyperglycemia.
   - continue ISS and standing insulin, follow fingersticks and titrate as
   needed
   # Thrombocytopenia
 Likely secondary to sepsis and temporally too
   early for HIT.  DIC labs neg [**2-6**] and now improving.
   -Continue to follow
   # FEN:  NPO (pulled out enteral feeding tube), hopefully can extubate
   and advance diet, if unable to wean will need new enteral tube

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II DM, CAD, and CABG, who presents with sepsis. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Fever: 101.3°F (spiked in the PM and AM)
* Wound cultures from the feet are growing group B strep (causative organism of bacteremia)
* Patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation
* Respiratory support: CPAP/PSV with FiO2 30%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Norepinephrine weaned off, systolic murmur heard best at the apex
* Cardiovascular: Systolic murmur, right radial pulse present, left radial pulse present
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli

The patient has been started on antibiotics, including vancomycin and metronidazole, and is receiving a five-day course of levofloxacin for CAP. The patient's labs show:

* WBC: 13.7
* Hct: 32.3
* Plt: 50
* Cr: 1.4
* TropT: <0.01
* TCO2: 19
* Glucose: 115

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction (e.g., respiratory, cardiovascular, renal)
* Pneumonia (although BAL and CXR are negative)
* Urinary tract infection (although pyuria is absent)
* Osteomyelitis (given the same organism isolated from blood and wound cultures)
* Endocarditis (given the new murmur and history of valve surgery)
* Thrombocytopenia (likely secondary to sepsis)
* Anion gap ketoacidosis (resolved)

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue antibiotics for strep and CAP
* Wean from mechanical ventilation and attempt extubation if ABG stable
* Diuresis with furosemide drip to achieve UOP of 1-1.5 L negative
* Follow-up with cardiology service to monitor cardiac status
* Continue standing insulin and follow fingersticks and titrate as needed
* Monitor for signs of sepsis-related organ dysfunction and adjust care accordingly.

The patient's ICU care includes:

* Nutrition: Nutren 2.0 (Full) at 40 mL/hour
* Glycemic control: Standing insulin
* Prophylaxis: DVT (SQ UF Heparin), stress ulcer (PPI), and VAP (to be determined)

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending improvement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II DM, CAD, and s/p CABG, who presents with sepsis. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient's blood cultures have grown Group B strep, which is the causative organism of bacteremia. The patient's temperature has been spiking, and he has been experiencing tachycardia and tachypnea.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has been weaned off norepinephrine and is being managed with pressure support.
3. Wide complex rhythm: The patient has a wide complex rhythm, which is being monitored by the cardiology service. The patient is paced, and no acute process is suspected.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has developed thrombocytopenia, which is likely secondary to sepsis. DIC labs have been negative.
5. Diabetes: The patient had anion gap ketoacidosis on presentation, but the gap has closed. He is being managed with insulin and regular FSG checks.
6. Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of CAD and has undergone CABG. He is being monitored for any changes in his cardiovascular status.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's sepsis could progress to septic shock, which would require immediate attention and treatment.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen, requiring further interventions such as tracheostomy or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and recent CABG surgery make him at risk for cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia could worsen, leading to bleeding complications or increased risk of bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient's sepsis could lead to secondary infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
6. Organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis could lead to organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury or liver dysfunction.

In terms of treatment, the patient is receiving antibiotics for his sepsis, and his blood cultures have been sent for further analysis. He is being managed with mechanical ventilation and pressure support for his respiratory failure. His wide complex rhythm is being monitored by the cardiology service, and he is being managed with insulin for his diabetes. His thrombocytopenia is being monitored, and he is being managed with SQ UF heparin for DVT prophylaxis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II DM, CAD, and CABG, who presents with sepsis. He was admitted with SIRS criteria, including WBC, fever, HR, and initial PaCO2. The original source of the sepsis is unclear, but group B strep was isolated from blood cultures and wound cultures from his feet. He was started on PCN for strep and d/c d vanc. The patient is intubated for respiratory failure, and a TEE is scheduled to rule out endocarditis. He has a wide complex rhythm, which is paced, and is being monitored. The patient had anion gap ketoacidosis on presentation, but the gap has closed. He is also experiencing thrombocytopenia, which is likely secondary to sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis is likely to cause further organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, cardiovascular instability, and hepatic and renal impairment.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's history of valve surgery and the presence of group B strep in his blood and wound cultures increase the risk of endocarditis.
3. Osteomyelitis: The same organism isolated from the patient's blood and wound cultures may also be causing osteomyelitis in his feet.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue, and he may require further respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's wide complex rhythm, which is paced, may indicate underlying cardiac instability, which could worsen his condition.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase his risk of bleeding, particularly if he requires invasive procedures or has a traumatic event.
7. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's anion gap ketoacidosis on presentation may recur if his glucose control is not maintained, and he may require further treatment with insulin and other medications.
8. DVT and PE: The patient's immobility and sepsis increase his risk of developing DVT and PE, which could be life-threatening if not recognized and treated promptly.
9. VAP: The patient's intubation and immobility increase his risk of developing VAP, which could lead to further respiratory failure and increased mortality."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Sepsis: The patient has sepsis due to group B strep in his blood culture.
* Wide complex VT: The patient has wide complex VT, which is concerning for VT versus SVT with aberrancy.
* Respiratory: The patient is intubated for respiratory support.
* Other issues: The patient has other issues, including DKA, thrombocytopenia, and possible CAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient's sepsis can lead to further organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
* Wide complex VT: The patient's wide complex VT can lead to cardiac arrest or cardiac death.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can lead to further hypoxia and acidosis.
* DKA: The patient's DKA can lead to further metabolic acidosis and potential cardiac arrest.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can lead to bleeding complications.
* Possible CAP: The patient's possible CAP can lead to further respiratory failure and potential death.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of CAD, DM2, and septic shock, who was transferred from another hospital with wide complex VT, DKA, and thrombocytopenia. He has been intubated and is currently being treated for sepsis, group B strep in his blood, and possible endocarditis. The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers, and further evaluation is needed to determine the source. He is also being monitored for VT versus SVT with aberrancy, and a TEE is planned for Tuesday. The patient has severe volume overload and is being managed with diuresis and repeat SBTs. Other issues include possible CAP, C. diff, and dental or abdominal abscess/fluid collection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, and further complications could arise if the source of infection is not identified and treated promptly.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's history of CAD and the presence of group B strep in his blood make endocarditis a possible complication.
3. VT versus SVT with aberrancy: The patient's cardiac rhythm is concerning, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe volume overload and need for diuresis increase the risk of respiratory failure.
5. C. diff: The patient's history of antibiotics and hospitalization increase the risk of C. diff infection.
6. Dental or abdominal abscess/fluid collection: The patient's history of pulling out a loose tooth and the presence of group B strep in his blood make dental or abdominal abscess/fluid collection a possible complication.
7. CAP: The patient's history of antibiotics and hospitalization increase the risk of CAP.
8. Volume overload: The patient's severe volume overload increases the risk of cardiac failure and respiratory failure.
9. Lactic acidosis: The patient's history of DKA and the presence of lactic acid in his blood make lactic acidosis a possible complication.
10. Renal failure: The patient's history of DKA and the presence of electrolyte imbalances increase the risk of renal failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's laboratory results suggest sepsis, and the blood cultures have grown Group B strep. The patient's wound cultures are also positive for Group B strep. The patient's antibiotics have been adjusted accordingly.

The patient's physical examination is significant for:

* Fever
* Tachycardia
* Hypertension
* Tachypnea
* Abdominal tenderness
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* Warm skin
* Attentive and responsive to simple commands

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Continue PCN for sepsis
* Finish 10-day course of levo for possible CAP
* Follow-up cultures
* Rule out C. diff
* Perform TEE to rule out endocarditis
* Consider pan scan to rule out dental or abdominal source of infection
* ID consult if still febrile
* S/p cardiology consultation
* TEE on Tuesday for AVR replacement and bacteremia of unclear source
* Follow-up EKG
* Diuresis to manage volume overload
* Repeat SBT with plans to extubate early afternoon

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction
* Endocarditis
* Abdominal abscess or fluid collection
* C. diff colitis
* Dental abscess or cellulitis
* Volume overload and pulmonary edema
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia
* Acute kidney injury (AKI)

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old male with a history of type II DM, CAD s/p CABG who
   presents with sepsis.
   # Sepsis:  On admission, patient met SIRS criteria with WBC, fever, HR,
   and initial PaCO2.    Original source is unclear though the  patient
   had 4/4 bottles positive for group B strep at [**Location (un) **].  The
   significance of the of this organism also being present at the site of
   the patient
s ulcers is unclear as these were probed and do not have
   deep tracks or purulence, and this could be a skin organism.  Pneumonia
   also unlikely given negative BAL and clear CXR.  No pyuria supporting
   urinary tract infection.
   - started PCN for strep on [**2-7**] (apprec ID reccs) and d/c
d vanc
   - has completed course of levo (2/13
 [**2-10**]) for ?CAP but d/c
d flagyl
   as c. diff neg
   - TEE scheduled for today to r/o endocarditis (?new murmur on [**2-8**]
   though pt does have a history of valve surgery)
   - CT torso to r/o abscess
   - ID consult
   - weaned off norepinephrine
   - speak to podiatry about ?MRI foot in context of same organism
   isolated as from blood and ? osteomyelitis
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for lethargy and ?acidosis.
   Reintubated after self-extubated in early am [**2-7**].
   - Initial acidosis possibly metabolic as little indication of primary
   pulmonary process on BAL or imaging, still given unable to rule out
   infiltrate and quite ill at presentation are completing a five day
   course of levofloxacin for CAP today.  Patient maintaining oxygenation
   and ventilation adequately on pressure support but more tachypnic after
   put on SBT.  Likely significant volume overload contributing to
   respiratory distress
   -Given marginal BP
s will attempt to continue diuresis today with
   furosemide drip aiming for UOP to get 1-1.5 L negative today if BP will
   tolerate (keep SBP
s >60)
   -S/p five day course of levofloxacin for CAP
   -SBT this PM and attempt extubation if ABG stable
   # Wide complex rhythm
 cardiology service consulted and determined that
   patient is a sensed and V paced.  Persistent tachycardia most likely
   due to infection, intermittent fever, and some degree of continued
   intravascular fluid depletion (despite total body volume overload).
   # Diabetes
 Patient had anion gap ketoacidosis on presentation in the
   setting of sepsis.  Gap has closed.  Patient put on standing insulin
   last PM for chronic hyperglycemia.
   - continue ISS and standing insulin, follow fingersticks and titrate as
   needed
   # Thrombocytopenia
 Likely secondary to sepsis and resolved as of
   [**2201-2-10**].  DIC labs neg [**2-6**].
   -Continue to follow
   - restart hep sc
   # FEN:  NPO (pulled out enteral feeding tube), hopefully can extubate
   and advance diet, if unable to wean will need new enteral tube
   # Access: R sided CVL (could potentially be pulled if extubated), PIV
   # PPx:  p-boots, PPI, hep sc
   # Code:  full
   # Dispo:  pending improvement

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old male with a history of type II DM, CAD s/p CABG who
   presents with sepsis.
   # Sepsis:  On admission, patient met SIRS criteria with WBC, fever, HR,
   and initial PaCO2.    Original source is unclear though the  patient
   had 4/4 bottles positive for group B strep at [**Location (un) **].  The
   significance of the of this organism also being present at the site of
   the patient
s ulcers is unclear as these were probed and do not have
   deep tracks or purulence, and this could be a skin organism.  Pneumonia
   also unlikely given negative BAL and clear CXR.  No pyuria supporting
   urinary tract infection.
   - started PCN for strep on [**2-7**] (apprec ID reccs) and d/c
d vanc
   - has completed course of levo (2/13
 [**2-10**]) for ?CAP but d/c
d flagyl
   as c. diff neg
   - TEE scheduled for today to r/o endocarditis (?new murmur on [**2-8**]
   though pt does have a history of valve surgery)
   - CT torso to r/o abscess
   - ID consult
   - weaned off norepinephrine
   - speak to podiatry about ?MRI foot in context of same organism
   isolated as from blood and ? osteomyelitis
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for lethargy and ?acidosis.
   Reintubated after self-extubated in early am [**2-7**].
   - Initial acidosis possibly metabolic as little indication of primary
   pulmonary process on BAL or imaging, still given unable to rule out
   infiltrate and quite ill at presentation are completing a five day
   course of levofloxacin for CAP today.  Patient maintaining oxygenation
   and ventilation adequately on pressure support but more tachypnic after
   put on SBT.  Likely significant volume overload contributing to
   respiratory distress
   -Given marginal BP
s will attempt to continue diuresis today with
   furosemide drip aiming for UOP to get 1-1.5 L negative today if BP will
   tolerate (keep SBP
s >60)
   -S/p five day course of levofloxacin for CAP
   -SBT this PM and attempt extubation if ABG stable
   # Wide complex rhythm
 cardiology service consulted and determined that
   patient is a sensed and V paced.  Persistent tachycardia most likely
   due to infection, intermittent fever, and some degree of continued
   intravascular fluid depletion (despite total body volume overload).
   # Diabetes
 Patient had anion gap ketoacidosis on presentation in the
   setting of sepsis.  Gap has closed.  Patient put on standing insulin
   last PM for chronic hyperglycemia.
   - continue ISS and standing insulin, follow fingersticks and titrate as
   needed
   # Thrombocytopenia
 Likely secondary to sepsis and resolved as of
   [**2201-2-10**].  DIC labs neg [**2-6**].
   -Continue to follow
   - restart hep sc
   # FEN:  NPO (pulled out enteral feeding tube), hopefully can extubate
   and advance diet, if unable to wean will need new enteral tube
   # Access: R sided CVL (could potentially be pulled if extubated), PIV
   # PPx:  p-boots, PPI, hep sc
   # Code:  full
   # Dispo:  pending improvement

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

* The 53-year-old male patient with a history of type II diabetes and coronary artery disease (CAD) is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to sepsis.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 102.1°F (38.9°C), heart rate of 96 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 117/58 mmHg.
* The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 30% and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute.
* The patient has a central venous catheter (CVC) and an arterial line, and is receiving prophylactic anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH).
* The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, indicating an active infection.
* The patient's blood cultures are positive for Group B strep and Cornybacterium, and the patient has a history of skin ulcers that were probed but do not have deep tracks or purulence.
* The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but his lactate level is elevated at 2.0 mmol/L.
* The patient's renal function is normal, but his liver function tests (LFTs) show mild elevation in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT).

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and liver dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen due to continued sepsis, volume overload, and inadequate ventilation.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's wide complex rhythm can worsen due to ongoing sepsis and electrolyte imbalance.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can worsen due to ongoing sepsis and bleeding complications.
5. Infection-related complications: The patient's infection can lead to complications such as abscesses, osteomyelitis, and endocarditis.
6. Metabolic complications: The patient's sepsis can lead to metabolic complications such as hyperglycemia, acidosis, and electrolyte imbalance.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's sepsis can lead to cardiovascular complications such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and cardiac failure.

Given the patient's complex condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to identify any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent adverse outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old male with a history of type II DM, CAD s/p CABG who
   presents with sepsis.
   # Sepsis
On admission, patient met SIRS criteria with WBC, fever, HR,
   and initial PaCO2.    Original source is unclear though the  patient
   had 4/4 bottles positive for group B strep at [**Location (un) **].  The
   significance of the of this organism also being present at the site of
   the patient
s ulcers is unclear as these were probed and do not have
   deep tracks or purulence, and this could be a skin organism.  Pneumonia
   also unlikely given negative BAL and clear CXR.  No pyuria supporting
   urinary tract infection.
   - started PCN for strep on [**2-7**] (apprec ID reccs) and d/c
d vanc
   - will continue levo (day 1 = [**2201-2-6**]) for ?CAP but d/c flagyl as c.
   diff neg
   - TEE scheduled for Tuesday to r/o endocarditis (?new murmur on [**2-8**]
   though pt does have a history of valve surgery)
   -weaned off norepinephrine
   -speak to podiatry today about need for further imaging of foot in
   context of same organism isolated as from blood and ? osteomyelitis
   # Respiratory failure  - Intubated for lethargy and ?acidosis.
   Reintubated after self-extubated in early am [**2-7**].
   - Initial acidosis possibly metabolic as little indication of primary
   pulmonary process on BAL or imaging, still given unable to rule out
   infiltrate and quite ill at presentation are completing a five day
   course of levofloxacin for CAP today.  Patient maintaining oxygenation
   and ventilation adequately on pressure support but more tachypnic after
   put on SBT.  Likely significant volume overload contributing to
   respiratory distress
   -Given marginal BP
s will attempt to diurese today with furosemide drip
   aiming for UOP to get 1-1.5 L negative today if BP will tolerate (keep
   SBP
s >60)
   -Complete five day course of levofloxacin for CAP
   -SBT this PM and attempt extubation if ABG stable
   # Wide complex rhythm
 cardiology service consulted and determined that
   patient is a sensed and V paced.  Persistent tachycardia most likely
   due to infection, intermittent fever, and some degree of continued
   intravascular fluid depletion (despite total body volume overload).
   # Diabetes
 Patient had anion gap ketoacidosis on presentation in the
   setting of sepsis.  Gap has closed.  Patient put on standing insulin
   last PM for chronic hyperglycemia.
   - continue ISS and standing insulin, follow fingersticks and titrate as
   needed
   # Thrombocytopenia
 Likely secondary to sepsis and temporally too
   early for HIT.  DIC labs neg [**2-6**] and now improving.
   -Continue to follow
   # FEN:  NPO (pulled out enteral feeding tube), hopefully can extubate
   and advance diet, if unable to wean will need new enteral tube
   # Access: R sided CVL (could potentially be pulled if extubated), PIV
   # PPx:  p-boots, PPI
   # Code:  full
   # Dispo:  pending improvement

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o M with CAD, DM2, [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH with septic shock,
   wide complex VT, DKA, thrombocytopenia.  Growing Group B strep in blood
   and found to have florid endocarditis with vegs on aortic valve, pacer
   wire, and with concerns for abscess of homograft.  Off levophed
   intubated.
   # Sepsis
 Group B strep in blood culture from OSH causing
   endocarditis, which has a high mortality rate.  Unclear source, but now
   wound cultures growing group B strep/corynebacterium.  Other sources
   include oral source (patient pulled out loose tooth a few days PTA).
   Now off levophed.
   - Continue PCN + gent.
   - Finish 10 day course of levo for possible CAP
   - F/U cultures
   - R/o C. diff
   - Pan CT scan to eval for embolic phenomenon
   #Persistent Fevers
 Possibly due to endocarditis, but other
   abscess/fluid collection from septic emboli cannot be r/o.
   - CT scan as above
   - ID consult today
   # Respiratory - Intubated for lethargy and acidosis.  Now remains
   intubated with severe volume overload.  Failed SBT. Will leave
   intubated and rest throughout am with attempt diuresis.  Also with
   large L pleural effusion with concerns for empyema.
   - Diuresis
   - Thoracic CT scan
 may need pigtail if evidence of infected fluid
   collection
   #Hypernatremia - FWF
   Other issues per resident note.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of CAD, DM2, and septic shock, who was transferred from another hospital with wide complex VT, DKA, and thrombocytopenia. He has florid endocarditis with vegetations on the aortic valve, pacer wire, and concerns for abscess of homograft. He was previously intubated and is now off levophed. The patient has ongoing sepsis, persistent fevers, respiratory issues, hypernatremia, and other concerns.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to worsen due to the ongoing infection and potential abscess formation. There is a high risk of mortality associated with sepsis, especially in the context of endocarditis.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's endocarditis is likely to progress, leading to further complications such as valve destruction, embolization, and abscess formation.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a high risk of further deterioration due to the presence of sepsis, endocarditis, and volume overload.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is likely to worsen, leading to further complications such as seizures, coma, and death.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely to worsen, leading to further bleeding complications.
6. DKA: The patient's DKA is likely to worsen, leading to further complications such as cerebral edema, seizures, and death.
7. Abscess Formation: The patient's abscess formation is likely to worsen, leading to further complications such as sepsis, organ failure, and death.
8. Embolic Phenomenon: The patient is at risk for embolic phenomenon due to the presence of sepsis and endocarditis, which could lead to further complications such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and death.
9. C. diff Infection: The patient is at risk for C. diff infection, which could lead to further complications such as colitis, sepsis, and death.
10. Empyema: The patient's large L pleural effusion is likely to worsen, leading to further complications such as empyema, sepsis, and death."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and septic shock. He was transferred from an outside hospital with a diagnosis of septic shock, wide complex ventricular tachycardia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's current condition is critical, with ongoing sepsis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. He has been intubated for lethargy and acidosis and remains intubated with severe volume overload. The patient's laboratory results indicate ongoing infection, with Group B strep growing in blood cultures, and he has been treated with penicillin and levofloxacin.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Endocarditis: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and the presence of Group B strep in his blood culture increase his risk of developing endocarditis.
2. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing sepsis can lead to further organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe volume overload and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation increase his risk of developing respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and the presence of Group B strep in his blood culture increase his risk of developing cardiac complications, such as myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and intubation increase his risk of developing neurological complications, such as pressure ulcers, sepsis-related encephalopathy, and stroke.
6. Infection-related complications: The patient's ongoing infection can lead to further complications, such as abscesses, fluid collections, and organ failure.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill with ongoing sepsis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. He requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment to address his underlying infections and prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o M with CAD, DM2 transferred from OSH with septic shock, wide
   complex VT, DKA, thrombocytopenia.  Growing Group B strep in blood on
   PCN/levo.  Off levophed
 intubated.
   # Sepsis
 Group B strep in blood culture from OSH.  Unclear source,
   but now wound cultures growing group B strep/corynebacterium.  Other
   sources include oral source (patient pulled out loose tooth a few days
   PTA) vs endocarditis.  Now off levophed.
   - Continue PCN.
   - Finish 10 day course of levo for possible CAP
   - F/U cultures
   - R/o C. diff
   #Persistent Fevers
 Possibly due to endocarditis, but other
   abscess/fluid collection cannot be r/o.
   - TEE in am
   - If negative, consider pan scan to r/o dental source or abdominal
   source
   # WCT - Concerning for VT versus SVT with aberrancy.
   - S/p cards c/s
   - TEE on Tuesday for AVR replacement and bacteremia of unclear source
   - F/U EKG
   # Respiratory - Intubated for lethargy and acidosis.  Now remains
   intubated with severe volume overload.  Failed SBT. Will leave
   intubated and rest throughout am with attempt diuresis.
   - Diuresis
   - Repeat SBT in am

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and septic shock. He was transferred from an outside hospital with a diagnosis of septic shock, wide complex ventricular tachycardia (VT), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's current condition is critical, with ongoing sepsis, persistent fevers, and concerns about endocarditis, abscesses, or fluid collections. He is intubated and has severe volume overload. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 102.1°F (38.9°C)
* Heart rate: 99 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 102/53 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 30 inspirations per minute (ipm)
* Oxygen saturation: 95%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 5 mmHg

The patient has received various medications, including antibiotics (Metronidazole, Levofloxacin, and Penicillin G potassium), anticoagulation (Heparin), and stress ulcer prophylaxis (Pantoprazole). He has also received insulin and midazolam infusions.

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 8.3-10.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.7 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 68-189 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.4 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.0 g/dL
* LDH: 214 IU/L
* Calcium (Ca++): 7.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4): 2.5 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies are pending, and microbiology results are still awaited.

The assessment and plan include:

* Continuing penicillin therapy
* Finishing the 10-day course of levofloxacin for possible community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)
* Following up on cultures
* Ruling out Clostridioides difficile (C. diff)
* Performing a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to evaluate for endocarditis
* Considering a pan scan to rule out dental or abdominal sources of infection
* Monitoring for and managing respiratory and cardiovascular issues

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Endocarditis or other infective endocarditis
* Abscesses or fluid collections
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Thrombocytopenia
* Diabetic ketoacidosis
* Volume overload
* C. diff colitis
* Other infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o M with CAD, DM2, [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH with septic shock,
   wide complex VT, DKA, thrombocytopenia.  Growing Group B strep in blood
   and found to have florid endocarditis with vegs on aortic valve, pacer
   wire, and with concerns for abscess of homograft.  Off levophed
   intubated.
   # Sepsis
 Group B strep in blood culture from OSH causing
   endocarditis, which has a high mortality rate.  Unclear source, but now
   wound cultures growing group B strep/corynebacterium.  Other sources
   include oral source (patient pulled out loose tooth a few days PTA).
   Now off levophed.
   - Continue PCN + gent.
   - Finish 10 day course of levo for possible CAP
   - F/U cultures
   - R/o C. diff
   - Pan CT scan to eval for embolic phenomenon
   #Persistent Fevers
 Possibly due to endocarditis, but other
   abscess/fluid collection from septic emboli cannot be r/o.
   - CT scan as above and TEE today
   - ID consult today
   # Respiratory - Intubated for lethargy and acidosis.  Now remains
   intubated with severe volume overload.  Failed SBT. Will leave
   intubated and rest throughout am with attempt diuresis.  Also with
   large L pleural effusion with concerns for empyema.
   - Diuresis
   - Thoracic CT scan
 may need pigtail if evidence of infected fluid
   collection
   #Hypernatremia - FWF
   Other issues per resident note.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of CAD, DM2, and septic shock, transferred from the operating room with florid endocarditis and possible abscess of homograft. He has been intubated and is receiving antibiotics for Group B strep sepsis. The patient has persistent fevers, and a CT scan and TEE are planned to evaluate for embolic phenomenon. He also has a large L pleural effusion with concerns for empyema and is being treated with diuresis and thoracic CT scan. The patient has hypernatremia and is receiving prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Endocarditis: The patient's condition is critical due to the presence of florid endocarditis, which can lead to further complications such as heart failure, stroke, and death.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is not fully controlled, and the source of the infection is unclear. This increases the risk of further complications, such as organ failure and death.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is intubated with severe volume overload. This increases the risk of further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia and respiratory failure.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is not fully controlled, and this can lead to further complications such as seizures, coma, and death.
5. Pleural Effusion: The patient's large L pleural effusion is a potential source of infection and can lead to further complications such as empyema and respiratory failure.
6. VAP: The patient is at risk for VAP due to his intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation.
7. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to his immobility and prolonged hospitalization.
8. Stress Ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to his critical illness and prolonged mechanical ventilation.
9. Organ Failure: The patient's sepsis and endocarditis increase the risk of organ failure, including renal, hepatic, and cardiac failure.
10. Mortality: The patient's condition is critical, and the mortality rate is high due to the presence of florid endocarditis and sepsis."

   had 4/4 bottles positive for group B strep at [**Location (un) **].  The
   significance of the of this organism also being present at the site of
   the patient
s ulcers is unclear as these were probed and do not have
   deep tracks or purulence, and this could be a skin organism.  Pneumonia
   also unlikely given negative BAL and clear CXR.  No pyuria supporting
   urinary tract infection.
   - started PCN for strep on [**2-7**] (apprec ID reccs) and d/c

   - CT torso to r/o abscess
   - ID consult
   - weaned off norepinephrine
   - speak to podiatry about ?MRI foot in context of same organism

   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for lethargy and ?acidosis.
   Reintubated after self-extubated in early am [**2-7**].
   - Initial acidosis possibly metabolic as little indication of primary
   pulmonary process on BAL or imaging, still given unable to rule out
   infiltrate and quite ill at presentation are completing a five day
   course of levofloxacin for CAP today.  Patient maintaining oxygenation
   and ventilation adequately on pressure support but more tachypnic after

   # Wide complex rhythm
 cardiology service consulted and determined that

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The 53-year-old male patient, with a history of type II DM and CAD s/p CABG, presents with sepsis. He has been admitted to the ICU with a temperature of 101.6°F, tachypnea, and a wide complex rhythm. The patient's TEE revealed vegetations on the aortic valve, ICD leads, IVC, and possible aortic root abscess. The ID consultant has diagnosed group B strep endocarditis, which is considered poor prognosis.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 8.4-10.7 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 27.2-29.3%
* Plt: 105-210 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 1.2-1.4 mg/dL
* TCO2: 23-29 mmHg
* Glucose: 76-256 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.0 g/dL
* LDH: 214 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.9 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL
* PO4: 2.5 mg/dL

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and diuretics. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 263. His cardiac rhythm is wide complex, with a paced ventricular rhythm.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, or respiratory failure.
2. Endocarditis-related complications: The patient's group B strep endocarditis may lead to complications such as heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, or embolic events.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly with invasive procedures or anticoagulant therapy.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's chronic hyperglycemia may increase the risk of diabetic complications, such as nephropathy, retinopathy, or neuropathy.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not managed effectively, leading to further complications such as respiratory acidosis or hypoxemia.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's wide complex rhythm and paced ventricular rhythm may increase the risk of cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
7. Infection-related complications: The patient's sepsis may lead to secondary infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections, which can worsen his condition.

Given the patient's complex condition, it is essential to monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely to prevent or manage potential complications effectively."

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old male with a history of type II DM, CAD s/p CABG who
   presents with sepsis.
   # Sepsis:  On admission, patient met SIRS criteria with WBC, fever, HR,
   and initial PaCO2.    Original source is unclear though the  patient
   had 4/4 bottles positive for group B strep at [**Location (un) **].  The
   significance of the of this organism also being present at the site of
   the patient
s ulcers is unclear as these were probed and do not have
   deep tracks or purulence, and this could be a skin organism.  Also has
   a history of pulling his own tooth and swallowing the tooth two days
   prior to admission.  TEE on [**2201-2-10**] demonstrated diffuse endocarditis
   involving ICD wires, aortic valve, right atrium.  Pneumonia also
   unlikely given negative BAL and clear CXR.  No pyuria supporting
   urinary tract infection.
   - cont PCN (day 1=[**2-7**]) and gentamicin (day 1=[**2-10**]) per ID reccs
   (appreciate consult).
   - has completed course of levo (2/13
 [**2-10**]) for ?CAP but d/c
d flagyl
   as c. diff neg
   - Cardiothoracic surgery following
 will attempt to acquire operative
   notes from CABG, AVR; prior ECHOs; cath reports
   - OH Surgeon per report is Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4176**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4177**]; cardiologist
   is Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4178**].  Communicated with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4176**] on [**2-10**]
   and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s office ([**Doctor First Name **]) on [**2-11**].
   - f/u CT torso and head (no clear abscess on prelim reads)
   - f/u ID reccs
   - weaned off norepinephrine
   - will defer MRI of foot (wound also grew beta hemolytic strep B) but
   f/u with podiatry regarding indications for MRI to r/o osteomyelitis
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated for lethargy and ?acidosis.
   Reintubated after self-extubated in early am [**2-7**].
   - Initial acidosis possibly metabolic as little indication of primary
   pulmonary process on BAL or imaging, still given unable to rule out
   infiltrate and quite ill at presentation are completing a five day
   course of levofloxacin for CAP today.  Patient maintaining oxygenation
   and ventilation adequately on pressure support but more tachypnic after
   put on SBT.  Likely significant volume overload contributing to
   respiratory distress.  Given likely need for operation and continued
   lethargy, will not attempt to aggressively extubate today.
   -Given marginal BP
s will defer diuresis today.  Had previously been on
   furosemide drip.
   -S/p five day course of levofloxacin for CAP
   # Wide complex rhythm
 cardiology service consulted and determined that
   patient is a sensed and V paced.  Persistent tachycardia most likely
   due to infection, intermittent fever, and some degree of continued
   intravascular fluid depletion (despite total body volume overload).
   # Diabetes
 Patient had anion gap ketoacidosis on presentation in the
   setting of sepsis.  Gap has closed.  Patient initially put on insulin
   gtt and converted to ISS but had significant hyperglycemia so
   restarting insulin gtt today
   - continue insulin gtt
   # Thrombocytopenia
 Likely secondary to sepsis and resolved as of
   [**2201-2-10**].  DIC labs neg [**2-6**].
   -Continue to follow
   - restart hep sc
   # FEN:  NPO (pulled out enteral feeding tube), hopefully can extubate
   and advance diet, if unable to wean will need new enteral tube
   # Access: R sided CVL (could potentially be pulled if extubated), PIV
   # PPx:  p-boots, PPI, hep sc
   # Code:  full
   # Dispo:  pending improvement

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   on wire in right atrium), IVC, and possible aortic root abscess.  No
   mitral vegetation.
   -ID: prognosis of grp B strep endocarditits very poor. will definitely
   need ICD wires removed. Add gent for synergy (done).
   -EP consulted: didn't see pt yet but agree needs leads out
   -CT [**Doctor First Name **] consulted: want patient's old ECHO images, op reports.

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely due to group B strep endocarditis, and is being treated with antibiotics. He also has a history of type II diabetes mellitus and is currently being managed with insulin therapy.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with a respiratory rate of 22 bpm and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 263. He is also experiencing tachypnea and is being treated with a fentanyl infusion.

The patient's cardiovascular status is also concerning, with a heart rate of 92 bpm and a blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg. He is also experiencing tachycardia and is being treated with a V-paced rhythm.

The patient's renal function is also concerning, with a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen level of 28 mg/dL. He is also experiencing hyperglycemia, with a glucose level of 256 mg/dL.

The patient's overall condition is critical, and he is at risk for further complications. The patient's treatment plan should focus on addressing his sepsis, managing his respiratory and cardiovascular status, and optimizing his renal function.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further sepsis and endocarditis
* Respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Cardiac arrest and arrhythmias
* Renal failure and acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Hyperglycemic crisis and diabetic ketoacidosis
* Infection and sepsis in the wound
* Osteomyelitis and septic arthritis in the foot

The patient's treatment plan should include:

* Continued antibiotic therapy for group B strep endocarditis
* Management of his respiratory status with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy
* Management of his cardiovascular status with V-paced rhythm and cardiovascular medications
* Optimization of his renal function with fluid management and diuretic therapy
* Management of his hyperglycemia with insulin therapy and glucose monitoring

   53 y/o M with CAD, DM2, [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH with septic shock,
   wide complex VT, DKA, thrombocytopenia.  Growing Group B strep in blood
   and found to have florid endocarditis with vegs on aortic valve, pacer
   wire, and with concerns for abscess of homograft.  Off levophed
   intubated.
    # Sepsis
 Group B strep in blood culture from OSH causing
   endocarditis, which has a high mortality rate.  Unclear source, but now
   wound cultures growing group B strep/corynebacterium.  Other sources
   include oral source (patient pulled out loose tooth a few days PTA).
   Now off levophed.
   - Continue PCN + gent.
   - Finish 10 day course of levo for possible CAP
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - S/p pan CT scan to eval for embolic phenomenon
 follow-up final read
   - Cards/ EP/ CT [**Doctor First Name **] following
   - Obtain records from OSH regarding cardiac surgery history
   - Transfer to CCU
   #Persistent Fevers
 Possibly due to endocarditis, but other
   abscess/fluid collection from septic emboli cannot be r/o.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and septic shock, transferred from the operating room (OSH) with florid endocarditis, wide complex ventricular tachycardia, and diabetic ketoacidosis. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a high risk of mortality due to the severity of his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock and endocarditis increase his risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's florid endocarditis increases his risk of developing embolic phenomena, such as stroke, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation increase his risk of developing respiratory failure, which can lead to prolonged ICU stay and increased mortality.
4. DKA: The patient's history of diabetic ketoacidosis increases his risk of developing recurrent DKA, which can lead to severe metabolic acidosis and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and endocarditis increase his risk of developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and potentially life-threatening events.
6. Infection: The patient's wound cultures growing group B strep/corynebacterium increase his risk of developing further infections, which can lead to prolonged ICU stay and increased mortality.
7. Embolic Phenomena: The patient's endocarditis increases his risk of developing embolic phenomena, such as stroke, which can lead to severe neurological deficits and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Abscess/Fluid Collection: The patient's septic emboli increase his risk of developing abscesses or fluid collections, which can lead to prolonged ICU stay and increased mortality.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and antifungals to treat the patient's endocarditis and sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac function closely and consider cardiac consultation.
3. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory status closely and consider weaning from mechanical ventilation.
4. Monitor the patient's glycemic control closely and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
5. Consider obtaining a CT scan to evaluate for embolic phenomena and abscess/fluid collections.
6. Continue to follow cultures and monitor the patient's wound for signs of infection.
7. Consider transferring the patient to a cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CCU) for closer monitoring and management of his cardiac condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   53 y/o M with CAD, DM2, [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH with septic shock,
   wide complex VT, DKA, thrombocytopenia.  Growing Group B strep in blood
   and found to have florid endocarditis with vegs on aortic valve, pacer
   wire, and with concerns for abscess of homograft.  Off levophed
   intubated.
    # Sepsis
 Group B strep in blood culture from OSH causing
   endocarditis, which has a high mortality rate.  Unclear source, but now
   wound cultures growing group B strep/corynebacterium.  Other sources
   include oral source (patient pulled out loose tooth a few days PTA).
   Now off levophed.
   - Continue PCN + gent.
   - Finish 10 day course of levo for possible CAP
   - F/U cultures
   - R/o C. diff
   - Pan CT scan to eval for embolic phenomenon
   #Persistent Fevers
 Possibly due to endocarditis, but other
   abscess/fluid collection from septic emboli cannot be r/o.
   - CT scan as above and TEE today
   - ID consult today
   # Respiratory - Intubated for lethargy and acidosis.  Now remains
   intubated with severe volume overload.  Failed SBT. Will leave
   intubated and rest throughout am with attempt diuresis.  Also with
   large L pleural effusion with concerns for empyema.
   - Diuresis
   - Thoracic CT scan

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and a recent transfer from the operating room with septic shock, wide complex ventricular tachycardia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient has been diagnosed with group B strep endocarditis, florid endocarditis with vegetations on the aortic valve, and a possible abscess of the homograft. The patient is currently intubated and has a history of severe volume overload. The patient has persistent fevers, which may be due to endocarditis or septic emboli.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock and endocarditis increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure.
2. Endocarditis-related complications: The patient's endocarditis can lead to complications such as abscesses, emboli, and valve damage, which can result in further organ damage or failure.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's severe volume overload and intubation increase the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia can lead to complications such as seizures, coma, or death.
5. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's diabetic ketoacidosis can lead to complications such as coma, seizures, or death if not properly managed.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can increase the risk of bleeding complications, especially if the patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy.
7. Infectious complications: The patient's group B strep infection can lead to further infectious complications such as sepsis, meningitis, or endocarditis.
8. Cardiac complications: The patient's endocarditis can lead to cardiac complications such as valve damage, cardiac failure, or arrhythmias.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent or treat these potential complications. The patient's treatment plan includes antibiotics, diuresis, and thoracic CT scans to evaluate for empyema. The patient's code status is full code, and the patient is currently in the ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of CAD, DM2, and a recent cardiac surgery, who was transferred to the ICU from the operating room with septic shock, wide complex VT, DKA, and thrombocytopenia. He has been diagnosed with florid endocarditis with vegetations on the aortic valve, pacemaker wire, and possible abscess of the homograft. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.6°F, heart rate of 91 bpm, and blood pressure of 96/50 mmHg. His respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and an FiO2 of 30%. He has a small right pleural effusion and bibasilar consolidative atelectasis.

The patient has a high risk of developing medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient has Group B strep in his blood culture, which can cause endocarditis, a high-mortality condition. The source of the infection is unclear, but it may be related to a wound infection or an oral source.
2. Persistent Fevers: The patient has a persistent fever, which may be related to endocarditis or an abscess/fluid collection from septic emboli.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which may not be sufficient to manage his respiratory failure.
4. DKA: The patient has recently resolved DKA, but he may still require insulin therapy to manage his blood glucose levels.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of cardiac surgery and may be at risk for cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and heart failure.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue PCN and gentamicin for possible CAP.
2. Finish a 10-day course of levofloxacin for possible CAP.
3. Continue to follow cultures to monitor for any new infections.
4. Obtain records from OSH regarding cardiac surgery history.
5. Transfer to CCU for further evaluation and management.
6. Consider pan-CT scan to evaluate for embolic phenomenon.
7. Follow-up final read by Cards/EP/CT.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to the CCU."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes
   mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR
   with abscess repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B
   Strep Endocarditis.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis -  The pt. has an apparent prosthetic
   device related endocarditis. Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] of entry at this time,
   likely source foot ulcers. Blood cultures NGTD here however OSH Cx with
   GBS. TEE shows significant aortic graft and pacer lead involvement.
   Given organism and presence of prosthetic material, likelihood of cure
   with medical management alone is felt to be low. CT surgery and EP
   consult placed. The pt has a pacer placed due to CHB, would need temp
   wire. Currently on Penicillin and gentamicin
   - ID, EP, and CT surgery following. Appreciate input.
   - CT head on [**2-10**] showed no acute process or abscesses
   - CT torso on [**2-10**] showed no abscesses but mediastinal LAD and
   periarotic abscess consistent with endocarditis above
   - f/u surveillence cultures, obtain final MICs on OSH GBS isolate
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin
   .
   # Septic Shock - The patient has been off pressors since [**2-9**], source
   of sepsis Group B strep bacteremia. Pt initially on broad spectrum
   antibiotics now tailored as above. Also completed 5 day course of
   levaquin for possible CAP [**Date range (1) 4183**]. Was on empiric flagyl for C.diff
   but discontinued today after negative testing.
   - Currently HD stable off pressors, continue invasive BP monitoring
   with goal MAP>65
   - Continue penicillin and gentamicin per ID recs
   - Lactate normalized, WBC falling, and screening BCx negative so far
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - Pt was intubated for lethargy on admission. He
   was reintubated after self-extubation on [**2-7**]. Currently on PSV with
   PEEP 5, FIO2 30%, reported tachypnea during SBT. Team had starteed
   diuresis with lasix gtt but DC'd due to hypotension. CXR with unchanged
   opacification of the left base consistent with lower lobe
   consolidation
   - Continue PSV
   - Will hold on lasix gtt for now given marginal BP, goal even
   - CT scan reports small effusion with bibasilar atelectasis
   .
   # B/L Foot Ulcers - podiatry reports mild serosanginous drainage on R
   and no drainage on left, tracks to soft tissue with no probe to bone.
   b/l xray negative for osteomyelitis
   - given GBS+ swabs from feet and bacteremia, necessitates need for
   further evaluation to rule out osteomyelitis
   - Unable to obtain MRI given pacer placement, consider bone scan for
   further evaluation
   .
   # Wide-Complex Tachycardia - EP eval - pt is A sensed and V paced,
   tachycardia most likely secodary to fever, underlying infection and
   intravascular depletion
   - treat underlying factors as above and continue to monitor
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 - Currently on insulin gtt for tight
   glycemic control in setting of sepsis
   - Continue gtt for now with Q1hr fingersticks
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Plt down to 50 on admission, now improved, most
   likely secondary to sepsis. DIC labs negative on [**2-6**]
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Anemia - HCT 27 trending down from 37 on admission, unclear baseline,
   will guaiac stools, check iron studies
   .
   # FEN - NPO, pt pulled NGT - will replace and restart TF
   .
   # Access - R IJ and A line
   .
   # PPX - Heparin SC, PPI
   .
   # Code - Full
   .
   # Dispo - Pending clinical improvement

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes
   mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR
   with abscess repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B
   Strep Endocarditis.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis -  The pt. has an apparent prosthetic
   device related endocarditis. Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] of entry at this time,
   likely source foot ulcers. Blood cultures NGTD here however OSH Cx with
   GBS. TEE shows significant aortic graft and pacer lead involvement.
   Given organism and presence of prosthetic material, likelihood of cure
   with medical management alone is felt to be low. CT surgery and EP
   consult placed. The pt has a pacer placed due to CHB, would need temp
   wire. Currently on Penicillin and gentamicin
   - ID, EP, and CT surgery following. Appreciate input.
   - CT head on [**2-10**] showed no acute process or abscesses
   - CT torso on [**2-10**] showed no abscesses but mediastinal LAD and
   periarotic abscess consistent with endocarditis above
   - f/u surveillence cultures, obtain final MICs on OSH GBS isolate
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin
   .
   # Septic Shock - The patient has been off pressors since [**2-9**], source
   of sepsis Group B strep bacteremia. Pt initially on broad spectrum
   antibiotics now tailored as above. Also completed 5 day course of
   levaquin for possible CAP [**Date range (1) 4183**]. Was on empiric flagyl for C.diff
   but discontinued today after negative testing.
   - Currently HD stable off pressors, continue invasive BP monitoring
   with goal MAP>65
   - Continue penicillin and gentamicin per ID recs
   - Lactate normalized, WBC falling, and screening BCx negative so far
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - Pt was intubated for lethargy on admission. He
   was reintubated after self-extubation on [**2-7**]. Currently on PSV with
   PEEP 5, FIO2 30%, reported tachypnea during SBT. Team had starteed
   diuresis with lasix gtt but DC'd due to hypotension. CXR with unchanged
   opacification of the left base consistent with lower lobe
   consolidation
   - Continue PSV
   - Will hold on lasix gtt for now given marginal BP, goal even
   - CT scan reports small effusion with bibasilar atelectasis
   .
   # B/L Foot Ulcers - podiatry reports mild serosanginous drainage on R
   and no drainage on left, tracks to soft tissue with no probe to bone.
   b/l xray negative for osteomyelitis
   - given GBS+ swabs from feet and bacteremia, necessitates need for
   further evaluation to rule out osteomyelitis
   - Unable to obtain MRI given pacer placement, consider bone scan for
   further evaluation
   .
   # Wide-Complex Tachycardia - EP eval - pt is A sensed and V paced,
   tachycardia most likely secodary to fever, underlying infection and
   intravascular depletion
   - treat underlying factors as above and continue to monitor
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 - Currently on insulin gtt for tight
   glycemic control in setting of sepsis
   - Continue gtt for now with Q1hr fingersticks
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Plt down to 50 on admission, now improved, most
   likely secondary to sepsis. DIC labs negative on [**2-6**]
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Anemia - HCT 27 trending down from 37 on admission, unclear baseline,
   will guaiac stools, check iron studies
   .
   # FEN - NPO, pt pulled NGT - will replace and restart TF
   .
   # Access - R IJ and A line
   .
   # PPX - Heparin SC, PPI
   .
   # Code - Full
   .
   # Dispo - Pending clinical improvement

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of Group B Strep Endocarditis, septic shock, respiratory failure, and several other comorbidities.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiovascular complications: Given the patient's prosthetic device-related endocarditis, there is a high risk of cardiac complications, including valve failure, embolism, or further infection.
2. Sepsis and septic shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, and there is a risk of further deterioration or development of multi-organ failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration or development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and there is a risk of bleeding complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and there is a risk of further decline or development of anemia.
6. Infection control: Given the patient's bacteremia and presence of prosthetic devices, there is a risk of further infection or development of new infections.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal issues, including diarrhea and constipation, which can worsen with sepsis and antibiotic use.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration or development of neurological deficits.
9. End-stage renal disease: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and there is a risk of further decline or development of end-stage renal disease.
10. Osteomyelitis: Given the patient's bacteremia and presence of foot ulcers, there is a risk of development of osteomyelitis.

The patient's management plan includes ongoing antibiotic therapy, cardiovascular support, respiratory support, and close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values. The patient's condition requires ongoing evaluation and management by a multidisciplinary team, including intensivists, cardiologists, infectious disease specialists, and other specialists as needed."

   patient admitted to the CCU. please see admission note for details.
   - CT surgery recs were catherization, dental and carotid ultrasound do
   not plan to operate anytime soon
   - placed order for portable panorex which apparently is not possible,
   will need to find out from surgery whether or not this test is actually
   required for emergent surgery
   - EP saw patient yesterday and note recommendations include: Continue
   aggressive antibiotic therapy per ID, Will await CT surgical evaluation
   re: possibility of re-operation, as his lead/device extraction can
   occur simultaneously if this were to happen, If no surgery planned in
   near future, we will arrange for possible lead extraction.

   - ID, EP, and CT surgery following. Appreciate input.  Will clarify
   surgical plan with CT [**Doctor First Name **] and EP.
   - Per CT [**Doctor First Name **] recs: Cath, panorex, and carotid US.  Carotid US done.
   Will attempt to obtain oral cavity imaging
 d/w dental.  However need
   to rule out other sources of infection prior to going ahead with

   # Anemia - HCT 24 today trending down from 37 on admission, unclear
   baseline.
   - Follow up hemolysis labs. Could be due to direct toxicity of the
   infection, mechanical hemolysis from vegetation, or drug toxicity.
   - Guaiac all stools.  Negative x 1.  NG tube output is green, no
   visible blood.  Mucus without blood.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   likely source foot ulcers. Blood cultures NGTD here however OSH Cx with
   GBS. TEE shows significant aortic graft and pacer lead involvement.
   Given organism and presence of prosthetic material, likelihood of cure
   with medical management alone is felt to be low. CT surgery and EP
   consult placed. The pt has a pacer placed due to CHB, would need temp

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes
   mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR
   with abscess repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B
   Strep Endocarditis.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis -  The pt. has an apparent prosthetic
   device related endocarditis. Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] of entry at this time,
   likely source foot ulcers. Blood cultures NGTD here however OSH Cx with
   GBS. TEE shows significant aortic graft and pacer lead involvement.
   Given organism and presence of prosthetic material, likelihood of cure
   with medical management alone is felt to be low. CT surgery and EP
   consult placed. The pt has a pacer placed due to CHB, would need temp
   wire. Currently on Penicillin and gentamicin
   - ID, EP, and CT surgery following. Appreciate input.
   - CT head on [**2-10**] showed no acute process or abscesses
   - CT torso on [**2-10**] showed no abscesses but mediastinal LAD and
   periarotic abscess consistent with endocarditis above
   - f/u surveillence cultures, obtain final MICs on OSH GBS isolate
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin
   .
   # Septic Shock - The patient has been off pressors since [**2-9**], source
   of sepsis Group B strep bacteremia. Pt initially on broad spectrum
   antibiotics now tailored as above. Also completed 5 day course of
   levaquin for possible CAP [**Date range (1) 4183**]. Was on empiric flagyl for C.diff
   but discontinued today after negative testing.
   - Currently HD stable off pressors, continue invasive BP monitoring
   with goal MAP>65
   - Continue penicillin and gentamicin per ID recs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - Pt was intubated for lethargy on admission. He
   was reintubated after self-extubation on [**2-7**]. Currently on PSV with
   PEEP 5, FIO2 30%, reported tachypnea during SBT. Team had starteed
   diuresis with lasix gtt but DC'd due to hypotension. CXR with unchanged
   opacification of the left base consistent with lower lobe
   consolidation
   - Continue PSV
   - Will hold on lasix gtt for now given marginal BP, goal even
   - CT scan reports small effusion with bibasilar atelectasis
   .
   # B/L Foot Ulcers - podiatry reports mild serosanginous drainage on R
   and no drainage on left, tracks to soft tissue with no probe to bone.
   b/l xray negative for osteomyelitis
   - given GBS+ swabs from feet and bacteremia, necessitates need for
   further evaluation to rule out osteomyelitis
   - Unable to obtain MRI given pacer placement, consider bone scan for
   further evaluation
   .
   # Wide-Complex Tachycardia - EP eval - pt is A sensed and V paced,
   tachycardia most likely secodary to fever, underlying infection and
   intravascular depletion
   - treat underlying factors as above and continue to monitor
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 - Currently on insulin gtt for tight
   glycemic control in setting of sepsis
   - Continue gtt for now with Q1hr fingersticks
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Plt down to 50 on admission, now improved, most
   likely secondary to sepsis. DIC labs negative on [**2-6**]
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Anemia - HCT 27 trending down from 37 on admission, unclear baseline,
   will guaiac stools, check iron studies
   .
   # FEN - NPO, pt pulled NGT - will replace and restart TF
   .
   # Access - R IJ and A line
   .
   # PPX - Heparin SC, PPI
   .
   # Code - Full
   .
   # Dispo - Pending clinical improvement

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE: CCU Resident Progress Note
   Chief Complaint: transfer for endocarditis
   24 Hour Events:
   patient admitted to the CCU. please see admission note for details.
   - CT surgery recs were catherization, dental and carotid ultrasound do
   not plan to operate anytime soon
   - placed order for portable panorex which apparently is not possible,
   will need to find out from surgery whether or not this test is actually
   required for emergent surgery
   - EP saw patient yesterday and note reccomendations include: Continue
   aggressive antibiotic therapy per ID, Will await CT surgical evaluation
   re: possibility of re-operation, as his lead/device extraction can
   occur simultaneously if this were to happen, If no surgery planned in
   near future, we will arrange for possible lead extraction.
   - had some blood tinged NG tube contents, so changed PPI to IV BID
   - given continuing to fall crit ordered one unit of blood
   - kept patient NPO without tube feeds in case of procedure today

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair at aortic root, CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B Strep Endocarditis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to septic shock, respiratory failure, and endocarditis.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.3°C (100.9°F)
* Heart rate: 86 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 94/50 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 inspirations per minute (ipm)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) 10 mmHg

The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 350 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient is also receiving antibiotics, including penicillin and gentamicin, for the treatment of endocarditis.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 10.7 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit (Hct): 29.0%
* Platelet count (Plt): 189 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 32 mg/dL
* Glucose: 76 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: No acute distress, intubated, sedated
* Cardiovascular: Normal heart sounds, no murmur appreciated
* Respiratory: Diminished breath sounds at the bases anteriorly
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
* Neurologic: Follows simple commands, moves all four extremities

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Septic shock: The patient's blood pressure is low, and they are at risk of developing septic shock.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of developing respiratory failure.
* Endocarditis: The patient has a prosthetic device-related endocarditis, which can lead to further complications if not properly treated.
* Osteomyelitis: The patient has bony changes in their feet, which may indicate osteomyelitis.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may indicate thrombocytopenia.
* Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is low, which may indicate anemia.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case requiring close monitoring and management to prevent further complications. The patient's condition is unstable, and the healthcare team should continue to closely monitor their vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings to adjust their treatment plan accordingly."

   - CT surgery recs were catherization, dental and carotid ultrasound do
   not plan to operate anytime soon
   - placed order for portable panorex which apparently is not possible,
   will need to find out from surgery whether or not this test is actually
   required for emergent surgery
   - EP saw patient yesterday and note reccomendations include: Continue
   aggressive antibiotic therapy per ID, Will await CT surgical evaluation
   re: possibility of re-operation, as his lead/device extraction can
   occur simultaneously if this were to happen, If no surgery planned in
   near future, we will arrange for possible lead extraction.

   with abscess repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B
   Strep Endocarditis.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis -  The pt. has an apparent prosthetic
   device related endocarditis. Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] of entry at this time,
   likely source foot ulcers. Blood cultures NGTD here however OSH Cx with
   GBS. TEE shows significant aortic graft and pacer lead involvement.
   Given organism and presence of prosthetic material, likelihood of cure
   with medical management alone is felt to be low. CT surgery and EP
   consult placed. The pt has a pacer placed due to CHB, would need temp
   wire. Currently on Penicillin and gentamicin
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin
   - f/u surveillence cultures, obtain final MICs on OSH GBS isolate

   but discontinued today after negative testing.
   - Currently HD stable off pressors, continue invasive BP monitoring
   with goal MAP>65
   - Continue penicillin and gentamicin per ID recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes
   mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR
   with abscess repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B
   Strep Endocarditis.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis -  The pt. has an apparent prosthetic
   device related endocarditis. Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] of entry at this time,
   likely source foot ulcers. Blood cultures NGTD here however OSH Cx with
   GBS. TEE shows significant aortic graft and pacer lead involvement.
   Given organism and presence of prosthetic material, likelihood of cure
   with medical management alone is felt to be low. CT surgery and EP
   consult placed. The pt has a pacer placed due to CHB, would need temp
   wire. Currently on Penicillin and gentamicin
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin
   - f/u surveillence cultures, obtain final MICs on OSH GBS isolate
   - Appreciate ID and CT surgery recs, OSH echo and operative reports
   obtained
   - Appreciate EP recs, will await decision about consideration and
   timing of lead extraction
   .
   # Septic Shock - The patient has been off pressors since [**2-9**], source
   of sepsis Group B strep bacteremia. Pt initially on broad spectrum
   antibiotics now tailored as above. Also completed 5 day course of
   levaquin for possible CAP [**Date range (1) 4183**]. Was on empiric flagyl for C.diff
   but discontinued today after negative testing.
   - Currently HD stable off pressors, continue invasive BP monitoring
   with goal MAP>65
   - Continue penicillin and gentamicin per ID recs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - Pt was intubated for lethargy on admission. He
   was reintubated after self-extubation on [**2-7**]. Currently on PSV with
   PEEP 5, FIO2 30%, reported tachypnea during SBT. Team had starteed
   diuresis with lasix gtt but DC'd due to hypotension. CXR with unchanged
   opacification of the left base consistent with lower lobe
   consolidation
   - Continue PSV
   - Will hold on lasix gtt for now given marginal BP, goal even
   - CT scan reports small effusion with bibasilar atelectasis
   .
   # B/L Foot Ulcers - podiatry reports mild serosanginous drainage on R
   and no drainage on left, tracks to soft tissue with no probe to bone.
   b/l xray negative for osteomyelitis
   - given GBS+ swabs from feet and bacteremia, necessitates need for
   further evaluation to rule out osteomyelitis
   - Unable to obtain MRI given pacer placement, consider bone scan for
   further evaluation
   .
   # Wide-Complex Tachycardia - EP eval - pt is A sensed and V paced,
   tachycardia most likely secodary to fever, underlying infection and
   intravascular depletion
   - treat underlying factors as above and continue to monitor
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 - Currently on insulin gtt for tight
   glycemic control in setting of sepsis
   - Continue gtt for now with Q1hr fingersticks
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Plt down to 50 on admission, now improved, most
   likely secondary to sepsis. DIC labs negative on [**2-6**]
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Anemia - HCT 27 trending down from 37 on admission, unclear baseline,
   will guaiac stools, check iron studies
   .
   # FEN - NPO, pt pulled NGT - will replace and restart TF
   .
   # Access - R IJ and A line
   .
   # PPX - Heparin SC, PPI
   .
   # Code - Full

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair at aortic root, CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B Strep Endocarditis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated and mechanically ventilated with a CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 40%, and PEEP 5 cmH2O.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a pacer placed due to CHB and has an apparent prosthetic device-related endocarditis. The likelihood of cure with medical management alone is felt to be low.
* Hemodynamic: The patient has been off pressors since 2/9, and the source of sepsis is Group B strep bacteremia.
* Renal: The patient has a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, and the urine output is 1,471 mL over the past 24 hours.
* Neurological: The patient is sedated and intubated, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 8.
* Laboratory results:
	+ White blood cell count (WBC): 10.7
	+ Hematocrit (Hct): 29.0
	+ Platelet count (Plt): 189
	+ Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
	+ Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 32 mEq/L
	+ Sodium: 145 mEq/L
	+ Potassium: 4.2 mEq/L
	+ Calcium: 7.5 mg/dL

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-inch tall, 116.2 kg male admitted to the CCU with a chief complaint of endocarditis. The patient has a history of cardiac dysrhythmia and is currently receiving antibiotics, including gentamicin and penicillin G potassium.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, and blood pressure of 94/50 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with a respiratory rate of 23 inspirations per minute and an oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy through an endotracheal tube.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 10.7, hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 189. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L, which is slightly low.

The patient's physical examination is notable for diminished breath sounds at the bases anteriorly, suggesting possible pneumonia. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present.

The patient's assessment and plan include sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, acute hyperglycemia, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient is receiving ICU care, including glycemic control and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, or respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock, given the patient's history of cardiac dysrhythmia and endocarditis.
3. Respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
4. Hyperglycemia, which may lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome.
5. Pneumonia, which may require antibiotic therapy and may lead to respiratory failure.
6. Deep vein thrombosis, which may require anticoagulation therapy.
7. Stress ulcer, which may require proton pump inhibitor therapy.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia, which may require antibiotic therapy and may lead to respiratory failure.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent these potential complications."

   will need to find out from surgery whether or not this test is actually
   required for emergent surgery
   - EP saw patient yesterday and note recommendations include: Continue
   aggressive antibiotic therapy per ID, Will await CT surgical evaluation
   re: possibility of re-operation, as his lead/device extraction can
   occur simultaneously if this were to happen, If no surgery planned in
   near future, we will arrange for possible lead extraction.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes
   mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR
   with abscess repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B
   Strep Endocarditis.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis -  The pt. has an apparent prosthetic
   device related endocarditis. Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] of entry at this time,
   likely source foot ulcers. Blood cultures NGTD here however OSH Cx with
   GBS. TEE shows significant aortic graft and pacer lead involvement.
   Given organism and presence of prosthetic material, likelihood of cure
   with medical management alone is felt to be low. CT surgery and EP
   consult placed. The pt has a pacer placed due to CHB, would need temp
   wire. Currently on Penicillin and gentamicin
   - ID, EP, and CT surgery following. Appreciate input.  Will clarify
   surgical plan with CT [**Doctor First Name **] and EP.
   - Per CT [**Doctor First Name **] recs: Cath, panorex, and carotid US.  Carotid US done.
   Will attempt to obtain oral cavity imaging
 d/w dental.  However need
   to rule out other sources of infection prior to going ahead with
   surgery.
   - CT head on [**2-10**] showed no acute process or abscesses
   - CT torso on [**2-10**] showed no abscesses but mediastinal LAD and
   periarotic abscess consistent with endocarditis above
   - f/u surveillence cultures, obtain final MICs on OSH GBS isolate  -
   very sensitive to PCN.
   - Persistent low grade fevers
   - ESR 77 on [**2-7**]
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin for
   synergy.
   - Briefly discussed initiation of heparin for anticoagulation.  Will
   hold for now.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - Pt was intubated for lethargy on admission. He
   was reintubated after self-extubation on [**2-7**]. Currently on PSV with
   PEEP 5, FIO2 30%, reported tachypnea during SBT. Team had started
   diuresis with lasix gtt but DC'd due to hypotension. CXR with unchanged
   opacification of the left base consistent with lower lobe
   consolidation
   - Continue PSV
   - Will hold on lasix gtt for now given marginal BP, goal even.  Appears
   euvolemic.
   - CT scan reports small effusion with bibasilar atelectasis
   - Will discuss with [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] regarding prior barriers to extubation.
   - ? collapsed lung on CXR/CT scan with air trapping.  Will discuss with
   pulmonary today - ? bronch
   .
   # Anemia - HCT 24 today trending down from 37 on admission, unclear
   baseline.
   - Follow up hemolysis labs. Could be due to direct toxicity of the
   infection, mechanical hemolysis from vegetation, or drug toxicity.
   - Guaiac all stools.  Negative x 1.  NG tube output is green, no
   visible blood.  Mucus without blood.
   - Checking iron studies. Expect anemia of inflammation but may also be
   def in iron and or B12 which
   - Transfusing 1U pRBC today ([**2201-2-12**]).  f/u PM hct.
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 - Currently on insulin gtt for tight
   glycemic control in setting of sepsis
   - Continue gtt for now with Q1hr fingersticks.  Range is 80-120 for
   blood glucose.   Closely monitor when restart tube feeds today.
   .
   # Septic Shock
 Shock resolved.  The patient has been off pressors
   since [**2-9**], source of sepsis Group B strep bacteremia. Pt initially on
   broad spectrum antibiotics now tailored as above. Also completed 5 day
   course of levaquin for possible CAP [**Date range (1) 4183**]. Was on empiric flagyl
   for C.diff but discontinued today after negative testing.
   - Currently HD stable off pressors, continue invasive BP monitoring
   with goal MAP>65
   - Continue penicillin and gentamicin per ID recs
   - Lactate normalized, WBC falling, and screening BCx negative so far
   .
   # B/L Foot Ulcers - podiatry reports mild serosanginous drainage on R
   and no drainage on left, tracks to soft tissue with no probe to bone.
   b/l xray negative for osteomyelitis
   - given GBS+ swabs from feet and bacteremia, necessitates need for
   further evaluation to rule out osteomyelitis
   - Unable to obtain MRI given pacer placement, consider bone scan for
   further evaluation.  Impt to rule out infection prior to OR.
   .
   # Vpacing - EP eval while in [**Name (NI) 10**] - pt is A sensed and V paced,
   tachycardia most likely secondary to fever, underlying infection and
   intravascular depletion
   - treat underlying factors as above and continue to monitor
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Plt down to 50 on admission, now improved, most
   likely secondary to sepsis. DIC labs negative on [**2-6**]
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # FEN - NPO, pt pulled NGT - will replace and restart TF today.  No
   procedures today.
   .
   # Access - R IJ and A line
   .
   # PPX - Heparin SC, PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Code - Full
   .
   # Dispo - Pending clinical improvement.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes
   mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR
   with abscess repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B
   Strep Endocarditis.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis -  The pt. has an apparent prosthetic
   device related endocarditis. Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] of entry at this time,
   likely source foot ulcers. Blood cultures NGTD here however OSH Cx with
   GBS. TEE shows significant aortic graft and pacer lead involvement.
   Given organism and presence of prosthetic material, likelihood of cure
   with medical management alone is felt to be low. CT surgery and EP
   consult placed. The pt has a pacer placed due to CHB, would need temp
   wire. Currently on Penicillin and gentamicin
   - ID, EP, and CT surgery following. Appreciate input.  Will clarify
   surgical plan with CT [**Doctor First Name **] and EP.
   - Per CT [**Doctor First Name **] recs: Cath, panorex, and carotid US.  Carotid US done.
   Will attempt to obtain oral cavity imaging
 d/w dental.  However need
   to rule out other sources of infection prior to going ahead with
   surgery.
   - CT head on [**2-10**] showed no acute process or abscesses
   - CT torso on [**2-10**] showed no abscesses but mediastinal LAD and
   periarotic abscess consistent with endocarditis above
   - f/u surveillence cultures, obtain final MICs on OSH GBS isolate  -
   very sensitive to PCN.
   - Persistent low grade fevers
   - ESR 77 on [**2-7**]
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin for
   synergy.
   - Briefly discussed initiation of heparin for anticoagulation.  Will
   hold for now.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - Pt was intubated for lethargy on admission. He
   was reintubated after self-extubation on [**2-7**]. Currently on PSV with
   PEEP 5, FIO2 30%, reported tachypnea during SBT. Team had started
   diuresis with lasix gtt but DC'd due to hypotension. CXR with unchanged
   opacification of the left base consistent with lower lobe
   consolidation
   - Continue PSV
   - Will hold on lasix gtt for now given marginal BP, goal even.  Appears
   euvolemic.
   - CT scan reports small effusion with bibasilar atelectasis
   - Will discuss with [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] regarding prior barriers to extubation.
   - ? collapsed lung on CXR/CT scan with air trapping.  Will discuss with
   pulmonary today - ? bronch
   .
   # Anemia - HCT 24 today trending down from 37 on admission, unclear
   baseline.
   - Follow up hemolysis labs. Could be due to direct toxicity of the
   infection, mechanical hemolysis from vegetation, or drug toxicity.
   - Guaiac all stools.  Negative x 1.  NG tube output is green, no
   visible blood.  Mucus without blood.
   - Checking iron studies. Expect anemia of inflammation but may also be
   def in iron and or B12 which
   - Transfusing 1U pRBC today ([**2201-2-12**]).  f/u PM hct.
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 - Currently on insulin gtt for tight
   glycemic control in setting of sepsis
   - Continue gtt for now with Q1hr fingersticks.  Range is 80-120 for
   blood glucose.   Closely monitor when restart tube feeds today.
   .
   # Septic Shock
 Shock resolved.  The patient has been off pressors
   since [**2-9**], source of sepsis Group B strep bacteremia. Pt initially on
   broad spectrum antibiotics now tailored as above. Also completed 5 day
   course of levaquin for possible CAP [**Date range (1) 4183**]. Was on empiric flagyl
   for C.diff but discontinued today after negative testing.
   - Currently HD stable off pressors, continue invasive BP monitoring
   with goal MAP>65
   - Continue penicillin and gentamicin per ID recs
   - Lactate normalized, WBC falling, and screening BCx negative so far
   .
   # B/L Foot Ulcers - podiatry reports mild serosanginous drainage on R
   and no drainage on left, tracks to soft tissue with no probe to bone.
   b/l xray negative for osteomyelitis
   - given GBS+ swabs from feet and bacteremia, necessitates need for
   further evaluation to rule out osteomyelitis
   - Unable to obtain MRI given pacer placement, consider bone scan for
   further evaluation.  Impt to rule out infection prior to OR.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair at aortic root, CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B Strep Endocarditis. He was admitted to the ICU with a prosthetic device-related endocarditis, likely due to foot ulcers. He has a pacer placed due to CHB and would need a temporary wire. The patient is currently on penicillin and gentamicin, with plans to continue antibiotics and await CT surgical evaluation for possible re-operation.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including:

1. Respiratory Failure: He was intubated for lethargy on admission and reintubated after self-extubation. He is currently on PSV with PEEP 5, FIO2 30%, and has a CXR with unchanged opacification of the left base consistent with lower lobe consolidation.
2. Anemia: His HCT is trending down from 37 on admission, and it is unclear whether this is due to direct toxicity of the infection, mechanical hemolysis from vegetation, or drug toxicity.
3. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: He is currently on insulin gtt for tight glycemic control in the setting of sepsis.
4. Septic Shock: The patient has resolved septic shock and is currently off pressors.
5. B/L Foot Ulcers: Podiatry reports mild serosanginous drainage on the right and no drainage on the left, with no probe to bone on x-ray.
6. Vpacing: The patient is A sensed and V paced, with tachycardia most likely secondary to fever, underlying infection, and intravascular depletion.
7. Thrombocytopenia: His platelet count has improved from 50 on admission, likely secondary to sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a prosthetic device-related endocarditis, and there is a risk of further infection or abscess formation.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status may continue to deteriorate, requiring further intervention such as mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, requiring further evaluation and treatment.
4. Septic Shock: The patient may experience recurrent septic shock, requiring further treatment and management.
5. B/L Foot Ulcers: The patient's foot ulcers may worsen, requiring further evaluation and treatment.
6. Vpacing: The patient's pacing status may require further evaluation and management.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, requiring further evaluation and treatment.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and await CT surgical evaluation for possible re-operation.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider further intervention if necessary.
3. Evaluate the patient's anemia and consider further treatment if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's septic shock status closely and consider further treatment if necessary.
5. Evaluate the patient's foot ulcers and consider further treatment if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's pacing status closely and consider further evaluation and management if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's thrombocytopenia status closely and consider further evaluation and treatment if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes
   mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR
   with abscess repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B
   Strep Endocarditis.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis -  The pt. has an apparent prosthetic
   device related endocarditis. Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] of entry at this time,
   likely source foot ulcers. Blood cultures NGTD here however OSH Cx with
   GBS. TEE shows significant aortic graft and pacer lead involvement.
   Given organism and presence of prosthetic material, likelihood of cure
   with medical management alone is felt to be low. CT surgery and EP
   consult placed. The pt has a pacer placed due to CHB, would need temp
   wire. Currently on Penicillin and gentamicin
   - ID, EP, and CT surgery following. Appreciate input.
   - CT head on [**2-10**] showed no acute process or abscesses
   - CT torso on [**2-10**] showed no abscesses but mediastinal LAD and
   periarotic abscess consistent with endocarditis above
   - f/u surveillence cultures, obtain final MICs on OSH GBS isolate
   - Persistent low grade fevers
   - ESR 77 on [**2-7**]
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - Pt was intubated for lethargy on admission. He
   was reintubated after self-extubation on [**2-7**]. Currently on PSV with
   PEEP 5, FIO2 30%, reported tachypnea during SBT. Team had starteed
   diuresis with lasix gtt but DC'd due to hypotension. CXR with unchanged
   opacification of the left base consistent with lower lobe
   consolidation
   - Continue PSV
   - Will hold on lasix gtt for now given marginal BP, goal even
   - CT scan reports small effusion with bibasilar atelectasis
   .
   # Anemia - HCT 27 trending down from 37 on admission, unclear baseline.
   - Sending hemolysis labs. Could be due to direct toxicity of the
   infection, mechanical hemolysis from vegetation, or drug toxicity.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Checking iron studies. Expect anemia of inflammation but may also be
   def in iron and or B12 which
   - Transfusing 1U pRBC today ([**2201-2-12**])
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 - Currently on insulin gtt for tight
   glycemic control in setting of sepsis
   - Continue gtt for now with Q1hr fingersticks
   .
   # Septic Shock - The patient has been off pressors since [**2-9**], source
   of sepsis Group B strep bacteremia. Pt initially on broad spectrum
   antibiotics now tailored as above. Also completed 5 day course of
   levaquin for possible CAP [**Date range (1) 4183**]. Was on empiric flagyl for C.diff
   but discontinued today after negative testing.
   - Currently HD stable off pressors, continue invasive BP monitoring
   with goal MAP>65
   - Continue penicillin and gentamicin per ID recs
   - Lactate normalized, WBC falling, and screening BCx negative so far
   .
   # B/L Foot Ulcers - podiatry reports mild serosanginous drainage on R
   and no drainage on left, tracks to soft tissue with no probe to bone.
   b/l xray negative for osteomyelitis
   - given GBS+ swabs from feet and bacteremia, necessitates need for
   further evaluation to rule out osteomyelitis
   - Unable to obtain MRI given pacer placement, consider bone scan for
   further evaluation
   .
   # Wide-Complex Tachycardia - EP eval - pt is A sensed and V paced,
   tachycardia most likely secodary to fever, underlying infection and
   intravascular depletion
   - treat underlying factors as above and continue to monitor
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Plt down to 50 on admission, now improved, most
   likely secondary to sepsis. DIC labs negative on [**2-6**]
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # FEN - NPO, pt pulled NGT - will replace and restart TF
   .
   # Access - R IJ and A line

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - CT surgery recs were catherization, dental and carotid ultrasound do
   not plan to operate anytime soon
   - placed order for portable panorex which apparently is not possible,
   will need to find out from surgery whether or not this test is actually
   required for emergent surgery
   - EP saw patient yesterday and note recommendations include: Continue
   aggressive antibiotic therapy per ID, Will await CT surgical evaluation
   re: possibility of re-operation, as his lead/device extraction can
   occur simultaneously if this were to happen, If no surgery planned in
   near future, we will arrange for possible lead extraction.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement, and atrial fibrillation, currently admitted to the ICU for endocarditis. He has a prosthetic device-related endocarditis with a likely source of entry from foot ulcers. The patient has been treated with penicillin and gentamicin, and CT surgery and EP consults have been placed. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a persistent low-grade fever and respiratory failure. He also has anemia, septic shock, bilateral foot ulcers, wide-complex tachycardia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection progression: The patient's endocarditis may worsen, leading to further complications such as cardiac valve damage, abscess formation, or septicemia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, requiring further interventions such as increased oxygen support or mechanical ventilation.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and organs.
4. Septic shock: The patient may experience a recurrence of septic shock, requiring further treatment and monitoring.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Foot ulcers: The patient's foot ulcers may worsen, leading to osteomyelitis or sepsis.
7. Wide-complex tachycardia: The patient's wide-complex tachycardia may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
8. Pacer-related complications: The patient's pacemaker may malfunction or cause further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.

Recommendations:

1. Continue aggressive antibiotic therapy and monitor the patient's response.
2. Perform further imaging studies, such as a bone scan, to evaluate for osteomyelitis.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust mechanical ventilation as necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusions as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's septic shock and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's thrombocytopenia and consider platelet transfusions as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's foot ulcers and consider further evaluation and treatment as necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's wide-complex tachycardia and adjust treatment as necessary.
9. Consider further evaluation of the patient's pacemaker and adjust treatment as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes
   mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR
   with abscess repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B
   Strep Endocarditis.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis -  The pt. has an apparent prosthetic
   device related endocarditis. Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] of entry at this time,
   likely source foot ulcers. Blood cultures NGTD here however OSH Cx with
   GBS. TEE shows significant aortic graft and pacer lead involvement.
   Given organism and presence of prosthetic material, likelihood of cure
   with medical management alone is felt to be low. CT surgery and EP
   consult placed. The pt has a pacer placed due to CHB, would need temp
   wire. Currently on Penicillin and gentamicin
   - ID, EP, and CT surgery following. Appreciate input.  Will clarify
   surgical plan with CT [**Doctor First Name **] and EP.
   - Per CT [**Doctor First Name **] recs: Cath, panorex, and carotid US.  Carotid US done.
   Will attempt to obtain oral cavity imaging
 d/w dental.  However need
   to rule out other sources of infection prior to going ahead with
   surgery.
   - CT head on [**2-10**] showed no acute process or abscesses
   - CT torso on [**2-10**] showed no abscesses but mediastinal LAD and
   periarotic abscess consistent with endocarditis above
   - f/u surveillence cultures, obtain final MICs on OSH GBS isolate  -
   very sensitive to PCN.
   - Persistent low grade fevers
   - ESR 77 on [**2-7**]
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin for
   synergy.
   - Briefly discussed initiation of heparin for anticoagulation.  Will
   hold for now.
   - Bone scan today for osteo
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - Pt was intubated for lethargy on admission. He
   was reintubated after self-extubation on [**2-7**]. Currently on PSV with
   PEEP 5, FIO2 30%, reported tachypnea during SBT. Team had started
   diuresis with lasix gtt but DC'd due to hypotension. CXR with unchanged
   opacification of the left base consistent with lower lobe
   consolidation
   - Self extubated and doing well now.
   - Will hold on lasix gtt for now given marginal BP, goal even.  Appears
   euvolemic.
   - CT scan reports small effusion with bibasilar atelectasis
   - Will discuss with [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] regarding prior barriers to extubation.
   - ? collapsed lung on CXR/CT scan with air trapping.  Will continue to
   follow as pt now extubated and comfortable
   .
   # Anemia - HCT trending down from 37 on admission, unclear baseline.
   Bumped appropriately to 28.8 from 24 with 1U pRBC but continues to
   trend down.
   - No signs of hemolysis. Retics low and ferritin very elevated
   consistent with anemia of inflammation. Could also be due to direct
   toxicity of the infection, mechanical hemolysis from vegetation, or
   drug toxicity.
   - Guaiac all stools.  Negative x 1.  NG tube output is green, no
   visible blood.  Mucus without blood.
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 - Currently on insulin gtt for tight
   glycemic control in setting of sepsis
   - Continue gtt for now with Q1hr fingersticks.  Range is 80-120 for
   blood glucose.   Closely monitor when restart tube feeds today.
   .
   # Septic Shock
 Shock resolved.  The patient has been off pressors
   since [**2-9**], source of sepsis Group B strep bacteremia. Pt initially on
   broad spectrum antibiotics now tailored as above. Also completed 5 day
   course of levaquin for possible CAP [**Date range (1) 4183**]. Was on empiric flagyl
   for C.diff but discontinued today after negative testing.
   - Currently HD stable off pressors, continue invasive BP monitoring
   with goal MAP>65
   - Continue penicillin and gentamicin per ID recs
   - Lactate normalized, WBC falling, and screening BCx negative so far
   .
   # B/L Foot Ulcers - podiatry reports mild serosanginous drainage on R
   and no drainage on left, tracks to soft tissue with no probe to bone.
   b/l xray negative for osteomyelitis
   - given GBS+ swabs from feet and bacteremia, necessitates need for
   further evaluation to rule out osteomyelitis
   - Unable to obtain MRI given pacer placement, consider bone scan for
   further evaluation.  Impt to rule out infection prior to OR.
   .
   # Vpacing - EP eval while in [**Name (NI) 10**] - pt is A sensed and V paced,
   tachycardia most likely secondary to fever, underlying infection and
   intravascular depletion
   - treat underlying factors as above and continue to monitor
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Plt down to 50 on admission, now improved, most
   likely secondary to sepsis. DIC labs negative on [**2-6**]
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # FEN - NPO, pt pulled NGT - will replace and restart TF today.  No
   procedures today.
   .
   # Access - R IJ and A line
   .
   # PPX - Heparin SC, PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Code - Full
   .
   # Dispo - Pending clinical improvement.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes
   mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR
   with abscess repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B
   Strep Endocarditis.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis -  The pt. has an apparent prosthetic
   device related endocarditis. Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] of entry at this time,
   likely source foot ulcers. Blood cultures NGTD here however OSH Cx with
   GBS. TEE shows significant aortic graft and pacer lead involvement.
   Given organism and presence of prosthetic material, likelihood of cure
   with medical management alone is felt to be low. CT surgery and EP
   consult placed. The pt has a pacer placed due to CHB, would need temp
   wire. Currently on Penicillin and gentamicin
   - ID, EP, and CT surgery following. Appreciate input.  Will clarify
   surgical plan with CT [**Doctor First Name **] and EP.
   - Per CT [**Doctor First Name **] recs: Cath, panorex, and carotid US.  Carotid US done.
   Will attempt to obtain oral cavity imaging
 d/w dental.  However need
   to rule out other sources of infection prior to going ahead with
   surgery.
   - CT head on [**2-10**] showed no acute process or abscesses
   - CT torso on [**2-10**] showed no abscesses but mediastinal LAD and
   periarotic abscess consistent with endocarditis above
   - f/u surveillence cultures, obtain final MICs on OSH GBS isolate  -
   very sensitive to PCN.
   - Persistent low grade fevers
   - ESR 77 on [**2-7**]
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin for
   synergy.
   - Briefly discussed initiation of heparin for anticoagulation.  Will
   hold for now.
   - Bone scan today for osteo
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - Pt was intubated for lethargy on admission. He
   was reintubated after self-extubation on [**2-7**]. Currently on PSV with
   PEEP 5, FIO2 30%, reported tachypnea during SBT. Team had started
   diuresis with lasix gtt but DC'd due to hypotension. CXR with unchanged
   opacification of the left base consistent with lower lobe
   consolidation
   - Self extubated and doing well now.
   - Will hold on lasix gtt for now given marginal BP, goal even.  Appears
   euvolemic.
   - CT scan reports small effusion with bibasilar atelectasis
   - Will discuss with [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] regarding prior barriers to extubation.
   - ? collapsed lung on CXR/CT scan with air trapping.  Will continue to
   follow as pt now extubated and comfortable
   .
   # Anemia - HCT trending down from 37 on admission, unclear baseline.
   Bumped appropriately to 28.8 from 24 with 1U pRBC but continues to
   trend down.
   - No signs of hemolysis. Retics low and ferritin very elevated
   consistent with anemia of inflammation. Could also be due to direct
   toxicity of the infection, mechanical hemolysis from vegetation, or
   drug toxicity.
   - Guaiac all stools.  Negative x 1.  NG tube output is green, no
   visible blood.  Mucus without blood.
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 - Currently on insulin gtt for tight
   glycemic control in setting of sepsis
   - Continue gtt for now with Q1hr fingersticks.  Range is 80-120 for
   blood glucose.   Closely monitor when restart tube feeds today.
   .
   # Septic Shock
 Shock resolved.  The patient has been off pressors
   since [**2-9**], source of sepsis Group B strep bacteremia. Pt initially on
   broad spectrum antibiotics now tailored as above. Also completed 5 day
   course of levaquin for possible CAP [**Date range (1) 4183**]. Was on empiric flagyl
   for C.diff but discontinued today after negative testing.
   - Currently HD stable off pressors, continue invasive BP monitoring
   with goal MAP>65
   - Continue penicillin and gentamicin per ID recs
   - Lactate normalized, WBC falling, and screening BCx negative so far
   .
   # B/L Foot Ulcers - podiatry reports mild serosanginous drainage on R
   and no drainage on left, tracks to soft tissue with no probe to bone.
   b/l xray negative for osteomyelitis
   - given GBS+ swabs from feet and bacteremia, necessitates need for
   further evaluation to rule out osteomyelitis
   - Unable to obtain MRI given pacer placement, consider bone scan for
   further evaluation.  Impt to rule out infection prior to OR.
   .
   # Vpacing - EP eval while in [**Name (NI) 10**] - pt is A sensed and V paced,
   tachycardia most likely secondary to fever, underlying infection and
   intravascular depletion
   - treat underlying factors as above and continue to monitor
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Plt down to 50 on admission, now improved, most
   likely secondary to sepsis. DIC labs negative on [**2-6**]
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # FEN - NPO, pt pulled NGT - will replace and restart TF today.  No
   procedures today.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair at aortic root. He was admitted with Group B Strep Endocarditis, which is likely related to foot ulcers. He has been treated with penicillin and gentamicin, and has had a pacer placed due to CHB. He has been experiencing respiratory failure, anemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, septic shock, and thrombocytopenia.

24-hour events:

* Pulmonary complications: The patient had a collapsed right lower lobe and was reintubated after self-extubation.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a pacer placed due to CHB, and has been experiencing tachycardia secondary to fever and underlying infection.
* Hematological: The patient has been experiencing anemia, with a HCT trending down from 37 on admission. The anemia is likely due to anemia of inflammation, but other causes such as direct toxicity of the infection, mechanical hemolysis from vegetation, or drug toxicity cannot be ruled out.
* Infectious: The patient has been experiencing persistent low-grade fevers and has been treated with antibiotics. The patient has also had a bone scan to evaluate for osteomyelitis.
* Endocrine: The patient has been experiencing diabetes mellitus type 2 and has been treated with insulin.

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory failure due to his underlying lung disease and the need for mechanical ventilation.
* Anemia: The patient is at risk for further anemia due to the ongoing infection and the need for blood transfusions.
* Septic shock: The patient is at risk for further septic shock due to the ongoing infection and the need for antibiotics.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient is at risk for further thrombocytopenia due to the ongoing infection and the need for blood transfusions.
* Endocarditis: The patient is at risk for further endocarditis due to the ongoing infection and the need for antibiotics.
* Osteomyelitis: The patient is at risk for osteomyelitis due to the ongoing infection and the need for antibiotics.
* Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to the ongoing infection and the need for antibiotics.
* DIC: The patient is at risk for DIC due to the ongoing infection and the need for antibiotics.

Recommendations:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust transfusions as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's septic shock and adjust antibiotics as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's thrombocytopenia and adjust transfusions as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's endocarditis and adjust antibiotics as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's osteomyelitis and adjust antibiotics as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's sepsis and adjust antibiotics as needed.
* Consider the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Consider the use of DVT prophylaxis to prevent deep vein thrombosis.
* Consider the use of VAP prophylaxis to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement, and prosthetic aortic valve, currently diagnosed with Group B Strep Endocarditis, infected pacer leads, respiratory failure, anemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, septic shock, and bilateral foot ulcers. The patient is currently receiving medical therapy for his conditions and is being monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Endocarditis: The patient's Group B Strep Endocarditis could lead to further complications such as valve destruction, abscess formation, or embolization.
2. Infected Pacer Leads: The infected pacer leads could lead to septicemia, endocarditis, or other systemic infections if not properly managed.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could lead to further complications such as pneumonia, respiratory arrest, or cardiac arrest if not properly managed.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia could lead to further complications such as cardiovascular instability, decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, or increased risk of bleeding if not properly managed.
5. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 could lead to further complications such as hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, or nephropathy if not properly managed.
6. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock could lead to further complications such as multi-organ failure, cardiac arrest, or death if not properly managed.
7. Bilateral Foot Ulcers: The patient's bilateral foot ulcers could lead to further complications such as osteomyelitis, sepsis, or amputation if not properly managed.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia could lead to further complications such as bleeding, petechiae, or ecchymoses if not properly managed.
9. Renal Toxicity: The patient's Gentamicin therapy could lead to renal toxicity, especially if not properly monitored and managed.
10. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or respiratory depression if not properly managed.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair at aortic root, CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B Strep Endocarditis with infected pacemaker as well as aortic valve. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with septic shock, respiratory failure, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's condition has improved, and the septic shock has resolved. The patient is currently receiving medical therapy for the endocarditis and is being weaned off oxygen. The patient has also been transitioned to Lantus and HISS pre-meal for diabetes management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Endocarditis: The patient has Group B Strep Endocarditis with infected pacemaker as well as aortic valve, which can lead to further complications such as valve damage, abscess formation, and embolization.
2. Septic Shock: Although the patient's condition has improved, there is still a risk of septic shock recurring, especially if the patient develops a new infection or if the infection is not adequately treated.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, and there is a risk of it recurring, especially if the patient develops pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can worsen if the patient experiences blood loss or inflammation.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding if the patient experiences trauma or surgery.
6. B/L Foot Ulcers: The patient has B/L foot ulcers, which can worsen if the patient develops a new infection or if the ulcers are not properly managed.
7. Infected Pacemaker Leads: The patient has infected pacemaker leads, which can lead to further complications such as pacemaker failure or embolization.
8. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2, which can worsen if the patient does not properly manage their blood sugar levels.
9. FEN: The patient has FEN, which can worsen if the patient does not properly manage their fluid and electrolyte levels.
10. Access: The patient has access issues, including a removed a-line and a planned PICC insertion, which can increase the risk of bleeding or infection.

Overall, the patient has multiple medical complications that require careful monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve the patient's outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair at aortic root, CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B Strep Endocarditis with infected pacemaker as well as aortic valve. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for management of his condition.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 94/47 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia (Hct 24.7%), thrombocytopenia (Plt 278), and elevated white blood cell count (WBC 11.2). The patient's blood cultures are positive for Group B Strep.

The patient's medical conditions include Group B Strep Endocarditis, Prosthetic Aortic Valve, Infected Pacer Leads, Respiratory Failure, Anemia, Diabetes Mellitus Type 2, Septic Shock, and B/L Foot Ulcers.

The patient's treatment plan includes continued penicillin and gentamicin therapy, adjustment of gentamicin dosing, and consideration of a white blood cell scan to assess the extent of the infection. The patient is also receiving medical therapy for his respiratory failure and anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood cultures and elevated white blood cell count suggest that he is at risk for developing sepsis.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's infected pacemaker and prosthetic aortic valve increase his risk for developing endocarditis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if he develops pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen if he continues to experience blood loss or inflammation.
5. Diabetes mellitus type 2: The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 can worsen if he develops ketoacidosis or hyperglycemia.
6. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock can worsen if he develops organ dysfunction or failure.
7. B/L foot ulcers: The patient's B/L foot ulcers can worsen if he develops cellulitis or osteomyelitis.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust his treatment plan as needed to prevent these potential complications."

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair at aortic root, CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B Strep Endocarditis with infected pacemaker as well as aortic valve.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications, including:

1. Group B Strep Endocarditis: The patient has been diagnosed with Group B Strep Endocarditis, which is a bacterial infection of the heart valves. The infection is likely to be caused by the infected pacemaker and aortic valve.
2. Infected Pacer Leads: The patient has infected pacer leads, which are likely to be difficult to remove immediately.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has resolved respiratory failure and is currently on nasal cannula.
4. Anemia: The patient has likely BLOOD LOSS and INFLAMMATION as dual contributors to his anemia.
5. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient has been transitioned to Lantus and HISS pre-meal.
6. Septic Shock: The patient has resolved septic shock.
7. B/L Foot Ulcers: The patient has bone scan revealed Radiotracer uptake predominantly at the medial aspect of the first metatarsopalangeal joint, which is non-specific.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has improved thrombocytopenia.

The patient is currently receiving medical therapy for his endocarditis and has been started on penicillin and gentamicin. He is also receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin to prevent thrombosis.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's endocarditis and infected pacemaker may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or even sudden death.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure may recur, and he may require mechanical ventilation.
3. Infectious complications: The patient may develop secondary infections such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
4. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia may lead to bleeding complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial bleeding.
5. Nutritional complications: The patient's anemia and malnutrition may lead to further complications such as weakness, fatigue, and decreased immune function.
6. Endocrine complications: The patient's diabetes mellitus may lead to complications such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
7. Orthopedic complications: The patient's foot ulcers may lead to further complications such as osteomyelitis or amputation.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 72-inch tall male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of impaired physical mobility, SIRS, respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient has a history of cardiac dysrhythmia and is currently receiving Gentamicin, Penicillin G potassium, Furosemide, Pantoprazole, and Heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 38.2°C (100.7°F)
* Heart rate: 96 bpm
* Blood pressure: 94/47 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 97%
* CVP: 7 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show the following:

* WBC: 11.2
* Hct: 28.8
* Plt: 278
* Cr: 1.4
* TCO2: 34
* Glucose: 111
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR:14.8/27.1/1.3, CK / CKMB / Troponin-T:15/2/<0.01, ALT / AST:8-8, Alk Phos / T Bili:45/0.7, Differential-Neuts:81.5 %, Band:0.0 %, Lymph:13.8 %, Mono:3.1 %, Eos:1.4 %, Lactic Acid:0.8 mmol/L, Albumin:2.0 g/dL, LDH:214 IU/L, Ca++:7.9 mg/dL, Mg++:2.0 mg/dL, PO4:3.7 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Renal toxicity: The patient is receiving Gentamicin, which can cause renal toxicity. The patient's Cr level is 1.4, which is within the normal range, but may indicate early signs of kidney damage.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, which may indicate respiratory failure. The patient's SpO2 level is 97%, which is within the normal range, but may indicate early signs of respiratory distress.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a diagnosis of sepsis, which can cause multi-organ dysfunction. The patient's WBC count is 11.2, which may indicate an inflammatory response.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is 111, which is above the normal range. This may indicate hyperglycemia, which can cause a range of complications, including cardiovascular disease and kidney damage.
5. Cardiac dysrhythmia: The patient has a history of cardiac dysrhythmia, which may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and heart failure.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a range of medical complications, including renal toxicity, respiratory failure, sepsis, hyperglycemia, and cardiac dysrhythmia. The patient's laboratory results and vital signs indicate that the patient is at risk for these complications, and further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve. ID and CT
   surgery following.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis, Prosthetic Aortic Valve - plan is for
   patient to go to surgery although need to rule out osteomyelitis or
   other occult infection prior to going to OR. ID and CV surgery have
   been following. Reconsulted podiatry [**2-14**] to assess for osteomyelitis,
   bone scan only included foot was non-specific.
   - podiatry to see this morning and to have attending look at bone scan
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin for synergy
   - gent trough [**2-14**] was 1.1 so PM dose given
   - f/u daily ID recs
   .
   # Infected Pacer Leads - Given large vegetations might be difficult to
   remove immediately.
   - Appreciate EP following, adjustment made to sensing to determine if
   temp wires would be needed if pacer wires removed.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 Resolved, on nasal cannula.  Weaning off of
   oxygen likely require additional diuresis.
   - Lasix q AM
   - Appreciate pulm recs
   - trial of CPAP as needed
   .
   # Anemia
 Likely BLOOD LOSS and INFLAMMATION as dual contributors.
   Hct has been stable.
   - Gastroocult + NGT secretions, now on [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - tranfuse for crit < 25
   - active type and screen
   - guiac all stools

   # Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 -
   - Transition to lantus and HISS pre-meal.  Increase lantus to 15U hs
   from 10U.
   .
   # Septic Shock
 Shock resolved.
   .
   # B/L Foot Ulcers
bone scan revealed Radiotracer uptake predominantly
   at the medial aspect of the first metatarsopalangeal joint which is
   non-specific.
   - podiatry to reconsult in order to rule out osteomyelitis

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   hypotensive to 70s with movement
   - did full neuro exam: significant for decreased vision OU, OS worse
   than OD, OD able to read, OS able to count fingers - as per patient
   this is a chronic problem for 2 years, patient has IOL b/l also history
   of ? retinal issue likely from diabetes

   Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR with
   abscess repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B Strep
   Endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve. ID and CT
   surgery following.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis, Prosthetic Aortic Valve - plan is for
   patient to go to surgery although need to rule out osteomyelitis or
   other occult infection prior to going to OR. ID and CV surgery have
   been following. Reconsulted podiatry [**2-14**] to assess for osteomyelitis,
   bone scan only included foot was non-specific.
   - podiatry to see this morning and to have attending look at bone scan
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin for synergy
   - gent trough [**2-14**] was 1.1 so PM dose given
   - f/u daily ID recs
   .
   # Infected Pacer Leads - Given large vegetations might be difficult to
   remove immediately.
   - Appreciate EP following, adjustment made to sensing to determine if
   temp wires would be needed if pacer wires removed.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 Resolved, on nasal cannula.  Weaning off of
   oxygen likely require additional diuresis.
   - Lasix q AM
   - Appreciate pulm recs
   - trial of CPAP as needed
   .
   # Anemia
 Likely BLOOD LOSS and INFLAMMATION as dual contributors.
   Hct has been stable.
   - Gastroocult + NGT secretions, now on [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - tranfuse for crit < 25
   - active type and screen
   - guiac all stools
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 -
   - Transition to lantus and HISS pre-meal.  Increase lantus to 15U hs
   from 10U.
   .
   # Septic Shock
 Shock resolved.
   .
   # B/L Foot Ulcers
bone scan revealed Radiotracer uptake predominantly
   at the medial aspect of the first metatarsopalangeal joint which is
   non-specific.
   - podiatry to reconsult in order to rule out osteomyelitis
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Improved.
   .
   # FEN
 PO diet with modifications per speech & swallow service
   - consider advancing diet as per speech and swallow and nursing
   .

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair at aortic root. He is currently being treated for Group B Strep Endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37.9°C, Tcurrent 37.6°C, HR 86 bpm, BP 100/55 mmHg, RR 21 inspirations per minute, SpO2 98%.
* Neurological examination: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person and place, but not to year.
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula oxygen, ABG: pH 7.28, PCO2 28 mmHg, PO2 103 mmHg.
* Laboratory results: WBC 11.2 K/uL, Hct 28.8%, Plt 272 K/uL, Cr 1.4 mg/dL, TCO2 34 mmHg, Glucose 111 mg/dL.
* Imaging studies: Bone scan revealed radiotracer uptake predominantly at the medial aspect of the first metatarsopalangeal joint, which is non-specific.

The patient's medical conditions and complications include:

* Group B Strep Endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve.
* Osteomyelitis or occult infection, which needs to be ruled out prior to going to surgery.
* Infected Pacer Leads, which might be difficult to remove immediately.
* Respiratory Failure, which has resolved with nasal cannula oxygen.
* Anemia, likely due to blood loss and inflammation.
* Diabetes Mellitus Type 2, which is being managed with Lantus and HISS.
* Septic Shock, which has resolved.
* B/L Foot Ulcers, which are being managed with podiatry consultation.
* Thrombocytopenia, which has improved.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Osteomyelitis or occult infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
* Infected Pacer Leads, which can lead to septicemia and cardiac arrhythmias.
* Respiratory Failure, which can lead to hypoxia and acidosis.
* Anemia, which can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
* Diabetes Mellitus Type 2, which can lead to hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and long-term complications such as nephropathy and retinopathy.
* Septic Shock, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death.
* B/L Foot Ulcers, which can lead to cellulitis, osteomyelitis, and amputation.
* Thrombocytopenia, which can lead to bleeding complications and increased risk of bleeding.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin for synergy.
* F/u daily ID recs.
* Infected Pacer Leads: appreciate EP following, adjustment made to sensing to determine if temp wires would be needed if pacer wires removed.
* Respiratory Failure: weaning off of oxygen likely require additional diuresis.
* Anemia: transfuse for crit < 25, active type and screen, guiac all stools.
* Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: transition to Lantus and HISS pre-meal, increase Lantus to 15U hs from 10U.
* Septic Shock: resolved.
* B/L Foot Ulcers: podiatry to reconsult in order to rule out osteomyelitis.
* Thrombocytopenia: improved.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair at aortic root. He is currently admitted to the ICU with Group B Strep Endocarditis, prosthetic aortic valve, and infected pacemaker and aortic valve.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T: 37.6°C, HR: 86 bpm, BP: 100/55 mmHg, RR: 21 breaths/min, SpO2: 98%
* Neurological status: Alert and oriented, with decreased vision in the left eye, which is a chronic problem.
* Cardiovascular status: Hypotensive, with a heart rhythm of V-paced.
* Respiratory status: Respiratory failure resolved, on nasal cannula.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP: 8 mmHg, Total In: 960 mL, Total out: 1270 mL, Balance: -310 mL.
* Laboratory results: WBC: 11.2 K/uL, Hct: 28.8%, Plt: 272 K/uL, Cr: 1.4 mg/dL, TCO2: 34 mmHg, Glucose: 111 mg/dL.
* Medications: Penicillin G potassium, Gentamicin, Heparin Sodium, Pantoprazole, Lantus, and other medications as listed.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition include:

* Osteomyelitis: The patient's bone scan revealed radiotracer uptake predominantly at the medial aspect of the first metatarsopalangeal joint, which is non-specific. This suggests that osteomyelitis cannot be ruled out, and further evaluation is needed.
* Infection: The patient has Group B Strep Endocarditis, prosthetic aortic valve, and infected pacemaker and aortic valve. He is at risk for developing sepsis and septic shock.
* Respiratory failure: Although the patient's respiratory failure has resolved, he is still on nasal cannula and may require additional diuresis to wean off oxygen.
* Anemia: The patient has a history of blood loss and inflammation, which may contribute to his anemia.
* Septic shock: The patient has had a history of septic shock, and he is at risk for developing it again.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has improved, but he is still at risk for developing thrombocytopenia.
* Foot ulcers: The patient has b/l foot ulcers, which are at risk for developing osteomyelitis.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a prosthetic aortic valve and infected pacemaker and aortic valve, which may lead to cardiovascular complications such as endocarditis, prosthetic valve failure, and cardiac arrhythmias.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin for synergy.
* Consult podiatry to assess for osteomyelitis and rule out occult infection.
* Consider IR-guided PICC placement.
* Continue IV antibiotics and monitor for signs of sepsis.
* Wean off oxygen and diurese as needed.
* Monitor for signs of anemia and thrombocytopenia.
* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust medications as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust medications as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust medications as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair at the aortic root. He is currently being treated for Group B Strep Endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, and blood pressure of 100/55 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 21 inspirations per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of respiratory failure, which has been resolved, but he is still on nasal cannula and may require additional diuresis to wean off oxygen. He also has anemia, likely due to blood loss and inflammation, and is being treated with Lasix and a proton pump inhibitor.

The patient has a history of septic shock, which has been resolved, but he is still at risk for complications. He also has bilateral foot ulcers, which are being treated with podiatry consults and antibiotics.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.2 x 10^9/L, a hemoglobin level of 7.9 g/dL, and a platelet count of 272 x 10^9/L. His liver enzymes are elevated, and his renal function is normal.

The patient's medical plan includes continued antibiotics for his endocarditis, as well as treatment for his anemia and septic shock. He will also be seen by podiatry to rule out osteomyelitis and to assess the extent of his foot ulcers.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Osteomyelitis: The patient's bilateral foot ulcers may be infected, and osteomyelitis is a possible complication.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock has been resolved, but he is still at risk for sepsis due to his underlying endocarditis and foot ulcers.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure has been resolved, but he may still require additional diuresis to wean off oxygen.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if he continues to lose blood or if his underlying endocarditis and sepsis do not improve.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen if his underlying endocarditis and sepsis do not improve.
6. Infection: The patient's infected pacemaker and aortic valve may lead to further complications, such as endocarditis or sepsis.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's underlying cardiac disease, including his aortic root replacement and AVR, may lead to further complications, such as cardiac failure or arrhythmias.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement with an infected pacemaker and aortic valve, and Group B Strep endocarditis. He is currently in the ICU for treatment of his condition.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 105/59 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 99%.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 7.9 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 11.0 K/uL. His white blood cell count is 11.2 K/uL, and his C-reactive protein level is 28.8 mg/dL.

The patient's medical conditions include Group B Strep endocarditis, infected pacemaker leads, and respiratory failure, which has been resolved with nasal cannula oxygen therapy. He also has anemia, likely due to blood loss and inflammation, and is receiving transfusions and medications to treat this condition.

The patient's plan includes continued antibiotics for his endocarditis, and he is scheduled for surgery to remove the infected pacemaker leads and replace the aortic valve. He is also receiving therapy for his anemia and respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's endocarditis and infected pacemaker leads increase his risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and his current need for oxygen therapy increase his risk of developing respiratory failure again, which can be life-threatening.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if he continues to experience blood loss or inflammation, which can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and other complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen if he continues to experience platelet destruction or bone marrow suppression, which can lead to bleeding complications.
5. Infection: The patient's infected pacemaker leads and endocarditis increase his risk of developing infection, which can spread to other parts of his body and lead to serious complications.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition and history of complications require close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, aortic root replacement, and atrioventricular valve replacement, currently admitted to the ICU with Group B Strep Endocarditis and infected pacemaker. He has undergone ID and CT surgery and is clinically stable on IV antibiotics. The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including anemia, respiratory failure, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 105/59 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 99%. His respiratory support is being weaned, and he is currently on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.9 g/dL, an elevated white blood cell count of 11.2 K/uL, and a platelet count of 11.0 K/uL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and his liver function tests are mildly elevated.

The patient's plan includes continuing IV antibiotics, gentamicin, and penicillin, as well as a repeat TTE today. He will be reconsulted with podiatry to assess for osteomyelitis or other occult infection prior to going to surgery. The patient's surgical plan is to undergo surgery for the removal of the infected pacemaker and aortic valve, but this may be delayed due to the presence of large vegetations.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Osteomyelitis: The patient's bone scan revealed radiotracer uptake at the medial aspect of the first metatarsopalangeal joint, which is non-specific and may indicate osteomyelitis.
2. Infected Pacemaker and Aortic Valve: The patient's infected pacemaker and aortic valve may lead to further complications, such as septic shock, and may require urgent surgical intervention.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing blood loss and inflammation, and may require further transfusions.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may recur if his oxygen therapy is discontinued, and may require further respiratory support.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding and inflammation, and may require further platelet transfusions.
6. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen if his IV antibiotics are discontinued or if he develops further infections.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's infected pacemaker and aortic valve may lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and heart failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, Aortic
   Root Replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR with abscess
   repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B Strep
   Endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve. ID and CT
   surgery following. Clinically improved and stable for now on IV ABx.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis, Prosthetic Aortic Valve - plan is for
   patient to go to surgery although need to rule out osteomyelitis or
   other occult infection prior to going to OR. ID and CV surgery have
   been following. Reconsulted podiatry [**2-14**] to assess for osteomyelitis,
   bone scan only included foot was non-specific.
   - ID consulting. Recs appreciated
 will ask about medication that can
   be dosed less frequently for discharge
   - PICC today
   - podiatry continues to feel there is no active osteo in the foot
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin for synergy
   - gent trough [**2-15**] was 1.2
   - repeat TTE today
   .
   # Infected Pacer Leads - Given large vegetations might be difficult to
   remove immediately.
   - Appreciate EP following, adjustment made to sensing to determine if
   temp wires would be needed if pacer wires removed.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 Resolved, on room air.  Weaning off of oxygen,
   requires O2 at night for apnea.
   - Appreciate pulm recs
   - Pt with sleep apnea. Improved with NC O2. Will discuss CPAP with Pt
   .
   # Anemia
 Likely BLOOD LOSS and INFLAMMATION as dual contributors.
   Patient got 1 unit of blood on [**2-15**] without appropriate bump. Patient
   with low retic count.
   - Gastroocult + NGT secretions, now on [**Hospital1 **] PPI PO
   - active type and screen
   - guaiac all stools
   - transfuse as needed
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type 2
 Patient has had elevated fingersticks,
   increased Lantus yesterday.
   - cont Lantus, RISS
   .
   # Septic Shock
 Shock resolved.
   .
   # B/L Foot Ulcers
bone scan revealed radiotracer uptake predominantly
   at the medial aspect of the first metatarsopalangeal joint which is
   non-specific. Podiatry reconsulted and think that this is definitely
   not consistent with osteomyelitis and then uptake
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Improved.
   .
   # FEN
 PO diet with modifications per speech & swallow service
   - calorie count for Monday through Wednesday

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   53 year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, Aortic
   Root Replacement with aortic homograft [**9-28**], and AVR with abscess
   repair at aortic root [**3-29**], CHB s/p PPM, now with Group B Strep
   Endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve. ID and CT
   surgery following. Clinically improved and stable for now on IV ABx.
   .
   # Group B Strep Endocarditis, Prosthetic Aortic Valve - plan is for
   patient to go to surgery although need to rule out osteomyelitis or
   other occult infection prior to going to OR. ID and CV surgery have
   been following. Reconsulted podiatry [**2-14**] to assess for osteomyelitis,
   bone scan only included foot was non-specific.
   - ID consulting. Recs appreciated
 will ask about medication that can
   be dosed less frequently for discharge
   - PICC today
   - podiatry continues to feel there is no active osteo in the foot
   - Continue penicillin 4 million units Q 4hrs and gentamicin for synergy
   - gent trough [**2-15**] was 1.2
   - repeat TTE today
   .
   # Infected Pacer Leads - Given large vegetations might be difficult to
   remove immediately.
   - Appreciate EP following, adjustment made to sensing to determine if
   temp wires would be needed if pacer wires removed.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 Resolved, on room air.  Weaning off of oxygen,
   requires O2 at night for apnea.
   - Appreciate pulm recs
   - Pt with sleep apnea. Improved with NC O2. Will discuss CPAP with Pt
   .
   # Anemia
 Likely BLOOD LOSS and INFLAMMATION as dual contributors.
   Patient got 1 unit of blood on [**2-15**] without appropriate bump. Patient
   with low retic count.
   - Gastroocult + NGT secretions, now on [**Hospital1 **] PPI PO
   - active type and screen
   - guaiac all stools
   - transfuse as needed
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type 2
 Patient has had elevated fingersticks,
   increased Lantus yesterday.
   - cont Lantus, RISS
   .
   # Septic Shock
 Shock resolved.
   .
   # B/L Foot Ulcers
bone scan revealed radiotracer uptake predominantly
   at the medial aspect of the first metatarsopalangeal joint which is
   non-specific. Podiatry reconsulted and think that this is definitely
   not consistent with osteomyelitis and then uptake
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Improved.
   .
   # FEN
 PO diet with modifications per speech & swallow service
   - calorie count for Monday through Wednesday
   - nutrition consult, f/u recs
   .
   # Access - R IJ, IR PICC hopefully today, once PICC placed will d/c IJ.
   Plan for IR tomorrow.
   .
   # PPX - Heparin SC, PPI [**Hospital1 **], bowel regimen

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, Aortic Root Replacement with aortic homograft, and AVR with abscess repair at aortic root. He was admitted with Group B Strep Endocarditis with infected pacemaker and aortic valve. He has undergone ID and CT surgery and is currently clinically improved and stable on IV antibiotics. The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including:

* Respiratory failure, which has resolved and he now requires O2 at night for apnea
* Anemia, likely due to blood loss and inflammation
* Diabetes Mellitus Type 2, with elevated fingersticks and increased Lantus dose
* Septic shock, which has resolved
* B/L Foot Ulcers, with a non-specific bone scan uptake
* Thrombocytopenia, which has improved
* FEN, with a PO diet and modifications per speech and swallow service
* Access, with an R IJ and IR PICC in place
* PPX, with Heparin SC and PPI

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 37.7°C, Tcurrent of 37.3°C, HR of 81 bpm, BP of 105/59 mmHg, and SpO2 of 99%. His lab results show elevated WBC, Hct, and Lactic Acid levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Osteomyelitis or occult infection, which needs to be ruled out prior to surgical intervention
* Difficulty removing infected pacemaker leads due to large vegetations
* Anemia, which may require further transfusions
* Respiratory failure, which may recur if O2 is weaned too quickly
* Diabetic complications, such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia
* Septic shock, which may recur if infection is not properly managed
* Thrombocytopenia, which may require further treatment
* FEN, which may require further nutrition and hydration management
* Access issues, which may require further intervention
* PPX, which may require further management of bleeding and thrombosis risk."
