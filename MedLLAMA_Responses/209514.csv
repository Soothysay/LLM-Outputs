   Imaging: SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is a left ventricular
   configuration of the heart, with aortic enlargement and calcification.
   Although the cardiomediastinal contour is similar to prior studies
   allowing for differences in positioning and AP technique, there is
   increased prominence of vascular markings throughout the lung fields
   and upper zone vascular redistribution
   indicative of pulmonary edema. There is also a combination of effusion
   and consolidation at both lung bases in comparison to baseline
   radiographs. Evaluation of the left lung apex is limited given
   patient's head positioning. Osseous structures demonstrate moderate
   degenerative changes of the spine and shoulders.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Congestive heart failure.
   2. Bibasilar effusions/atelectasis and consolidations.
   Post-diuresis repeat PA and lateral when clinically feasible is
   recommended.
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease prsents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: unclear trigger for new hypoxic
   respiratory failure. She does not wear oxygen at home, but per report
   has nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic. This seems likely to be
   orthopnea related to worsening CHF, although she does not have a hx of
   CAD or CHF. Could be pulm edema related to uncontrolled hypertension
   and had a flash episode last night. CXR also concerning for RLL
   pneumonia, and she does have hx of recent CVA and could be aspirating.
   Other etiology on the differential could be PE as she was hospitalized
   recently, but no leg swelling and has been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP as below
   - consider echo, CT scan for further eval
   # PNA: has RLL infiltrate on CXR.  No leukocytosis, although higher
   than her baseline.  No history of fevers or chills.  Has recently been
   in rehab.  Has no signs of sepsis related to PNA. Legionella urinary
   antigen negative.
   - treat for HAP with vanco/cefepime for now
   - consider flagyl if patient decompensates for anaerobic coverage and
   treatment of potential chronic aspiration
   # CHF/Effusion: has what looks like R sided pleural effusion and
   evidence of fluid overload on CXR. Has decreased breath sounds on the
   R, but few crackles. Could either be related to heart failure, which
   seems feasible given her hx of orthopnea. Or could be a parapneumonic
   effusion.
   - echo in AM
   - consider CT scan of chest for better clarification of the pneumonia
   and the effusion
   - consider thoracentesis
   - would hold on diuresis given ARF and is likely dry
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control.
   - consider restarting home meds
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr of 3.2 from 3.3 yesterday from a
   baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year.  This may be her new baseline
   or may represent some mild pre-renal changes in the setting of an
   infection.
   - urine lytes
   - would hold on diuresis now, but would also be gentle with IVFs given
   her potential CHF and new effusion
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   - will add on Ca/Mg/Phos, based on results consider phos binders
   - contact outpatient nephrologist, consider renal consult
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 4.8 from 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic renal
   failure.  Has high baseline K and EKG has mild peaking of TWs but not
   changed from previous EKGs.  Received kayexcelate in the ED.
   - kayexcelate as needed
   - low K+ diet when taking POs
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - speech and swallow when respiratory status improves

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and chronic kidney disease, presenting with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) starting the previous night and continuing until morning. The patient has a CXR showing evidence of pneumonia and effusion, as well as worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient's worsening SOB and hypoxia can lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's RLL infiltrate on CXR can progress to severe pneumonia, leading to sepsis, respiratory failure, and even death.
3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's worsening CHF can lead to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and even cardiac arrest.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal failure can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and even renal failure.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation, and even cardiac arrest.
6. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema can lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
7. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's recent CVA and possible aspiration can lead to aspiration pneumonia, which can be life-threatening.
8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and underlying medical conditions can increase the risk of DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and even death.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications. The plan of care includes:

1. Continue to wean O2 as tolerated.
2. Treat for HAP with vanco/cefepime for now.
3. Consider echo, CT scan for further evaluation.
4. Hold on diuresis given ARF and is likely dry.
5. Restart home meds, including nitro gtt, atenolol, and amlodipine.
6. Monitor urine lytes and adjust IVFs accordingly.
7. Add on Ca/Mg/Phos, and consider phos binders based on results.
8. Contact outpatient nephrologist and consider renal consult.
9. Continue kayexcelate as needed and low K+ diet when taking POs.
10. Monitor for signs of sepsis, respiratory failure, and cardiac complications."

   Imaging: SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is a left ventricular
   configuration of the heart, with aortic enlargement and calcification.
   Although the cardiomediastinal contour is similar to prior studies
   allowing for differences in positioning and AP technique, there is
   increased prominence of vascular markings throughout the lung fields
   and upper zone vascular redistribution
   indicative of pulmonary edema. There is also a combination of effusion
   and consolidation at both lung bases in comparison to baseline
   radiographs. Evaluation of the left lung apex is limited given
   patient's head positioning. Osseous structures demonstrate moderate
   degenerative changes of the spine and shoulders.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Congestive heart failure.
   2. Bibasilar effusions/atelectasis and consolidations.
   Post-diuresis repeat PA and lateral when clinically feasible is
   recommended.
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease prsents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: unclear trigger for new hypoxic
   respiratory failure. She does not wear oxygen at home, but per report
   has nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic. This seems likely to be
   orthopnea related to worsening CHF, although she does not have a hx of
   CAD or CHF. Could be pulm edema related to uncontrolled hypertension
   and had a flash episode last night. CXR also concerning for RLL
   pneumonia, and she does have hx of recent CVA and could be aspirating.
   Other etiology on the differential could be PE as she was hospitalized
   recently, but no leg swelling and has been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP as below (vanc/cefepime)
   - TTE today
   # PNA: has RLL infiltrate on CXR.  No leukocytosis, although higher
   than her baseline.  No history of fevers or chills.  Has recently been
   in rehab.  Has no signs of sepsis related to PNA. Legionella urinary
   antigen negative.
   - treat for HAP with vanco/cefepime for now
   - Vanc level 10.3 this AM, change to [**Hospital1 7**] and check level tomorrow
   - consider flagyl if patient decompensates for anaerobic coverage and
   treatment of potential chronic aspiration
   # CHF/Effusion: has what looks like R sided pleural effusion and
   evidence of fluid overload on CXR. Has decreased breath sounds on the
   R, but few crackles. Could either be related to heart failure, which
   seems feasible given her hx of orthopnea. Or could be a parapneumonic
   effusion.
   - TTE in AM
   - would hold on diuresis given ARF and is likely dry
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Check HR in PM; if tolerates may consider Lopressor given
   hypertension requiring nitro drip yesterday. HR in 50s now.
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr of 3.2 from 3.3 yesterday from a
   baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year.  This may be her new baseline
   or may represent some mild pre-renal changes in the setting of an
   infection.
   - Fluid challenge today (500cc), then restart diet
   - would hold on diuresis now, but would also be gentle with IVFs given
   her potential CHF and new effusion
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes, re-check Creatinine in PM
   - will add on Ca/Mg/Phos, Phos okay now.
   - contact outpatient nephrologist, consider renal consult
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 4.8 from 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - F/u PM lytes to ensure stable potassium
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - PT
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes
   -          Start on clears, ADAT
   -          500cc fluid challenge today as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   evidence of fluid overload on CXR. Has decreased breath sounds on the
   R, but few crackles. Could either be related to heart failure, which
   seems feasible given her hx of orthopnea. Or could be a parapneumonic
   effusion.
   - TTE in AM
   - would hold on diuresis given ARF and is likely dry
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Check HR in PM; if tolerates may consider Lopressor given
   hypertension requiring nitro drip yesterday. HR in 50s now.
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr of 3.2 from 3.3 yesterday from a
   baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year.  This may be her new baseline
   or may represent some mild pre-renal changes in the setting of an
   infection.
   - Fluid challenge today (500cc), then restart diet
   - would hold on diuresis now, but would also be gentle with IVFs given
   her potential CHF and new effusion
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes, re-check Creatinine in PM
   - will add on Ca/Mg/Phos, Phos okay now.
   - contact outpatient nephrologist, consider renal consult
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 4.8 from 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic renal

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recent possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted to the ICU with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) starting two nights ago and a chest X-ray (CXR) showing pneumonia and effusion. She has also developed worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.4°C, heart rate of 61 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 159/57 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has been weaned off high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) on her left side, but requires a high-flow face mask on her right side due to decreased lung sounds on the right base.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.2 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 27.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 242 x 10^9/L. Her serum creatinine is 3.2 mg/dL, and her potassium level is 4.8 mEq/L.

The patient has been diagnosed with congestive heart failure, bibasilar effusions/atelectasis, and consolidations. She is also at risk for hypoxic respiratory distress, pneumonia, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening SOB and decreased lung sounds on the right base suggest that she may be at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's CXR shows evidence of pneumonia, which could progress and lead to sepsis or respiratory failure.
3. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's serum creatinine level is 3.2 mg/dL, which suggests that she may have chronic kidney disease.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is 4.8 mEq/L, which is higher than normal. This could lead to cardiac arrhythmias or other complications.
5. Congestive heart failure: The patient's CXR shows evidence of fluid overload, which could lead to worsening congestive heart failure.
6. Cerebrovascular accident: The patient has a history of possible CVA, which could lead to further complications or worsening of her condition.

Assessment and plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Treat the patient's pneumonia with antibiotics.
3. Manage the patient's congestive heart failure with diuretics and other medications as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's potassium level and adjust her medications as necessary to prevent hyperkalemia.
5. Consider ordering a troponin test to rule out myocardial infarction.
6. Consult with a nephrologist to manage the patient's chronic kidney disease.
7. Consider ordering a statin to reduce the patient's risk of cardiovascular disease."

   Imaging: SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is a left ventricular
   configuration of the heart, with aortic enlargement and calcification.
   Although the cardiomediastinal contour is similar to prior studies
   allowing for differences in positioning and AP technique, there is
   increased prominence of vascular markings throughout the lung fields
   and upper zone vascular redistribution
   indicative of pulmonary edema. There is also a combination of effusion
   and consolidation at both lung bases in comparison to baseline
   radiographs. Evaluation of the left lung apex is limited given
   patient's head positioning. Osseous structures demonstrate moderate
   degenerative changes of the spine and shoulders.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Congestive heart failure.
   2. Bibasilar effusions/atelectasis and consolidations.
   Post-diuresis repeat PA and lateral when clinically feasible is
   recommended.
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease prsents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: unclear trigger for new hypoxic
   respiratory failure. She does not wear oxygen at home, but per report
   has nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic. This seems likely to be
   orthopnea related to worsening CHF, although she does not have a hx of
   CAD or CHF. Could be pulm edema related to uncontrolled hypertension
   and had a flash episode last night. CXR also concerning for RLL
   pneumonia, and she does have hx of recent CVA and could be aspirating.
   Other etiology on the differential could be PE as she was hospitalized
   recently, but no leg swelling and has been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP as below (vanc/cefepime)
   - TTE today
   # PNA: has RLL infiltrate on CXR.  No leukocytosis, although higher
   than her baseline.  No history of fevers or chills.  Has recently been
   in rehab.  Has no signs of sepsis related to PNA. Legionella urinary
   antigen negative.
   - treat for HAP with vanco/cefepime for now
   - Vanc level 10.3 this AM, change to [**Hospital1 7**] and check level tomorrow
   - consider flagyl if patient decompensates for anaerobic coverage and
   treatment of potential chronic aspiration
   # CHF/Effusion: has what looks like R sided pleural effusion and
   evidence of fluid overload on CXR. Has decreased breath sounds on the
   R, but few crackles. Could either be related to heart failure, which
   seems feasible given her hx of orthopnea. Or could be a parapneumonic
   effusion.
   - TTE in AM
   - would hold on diuresis given ARF and is likely dry

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Imaging: SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is a left ventricular
   configuration of the heart, with aortic enlargement and calcification.
   Although the cardiomediastinal contour is similar to prior studies
   allowing for differences in positioning and AP technique, there is
   increased prominence of vascular markings throughout the lung fields
   and upper zone vascular redistribution
   indicative of pulmonary edema. There is also a combination of effusion
   and consolidation at both lung bases in comparison to baseline
   radiographs. Evaluation of the left lung apex is limited given
   patient's head positioning. Osseous structures demonstrate moderate
   degenerative changes of the spine and shoulders.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Congestive heart failure.
   2. Bibasilar effusions/atelectasis and consolidations.
   Post-diuresis repeat PA and lateral when clinically feasible is
   recommended.
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease prsents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: unclear trigger for new hypoxic
   respiratory failure. She does not wear oxygen at home, but per report
   has nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic. This seems likely to be
   orthopnea related to worsening CHF, although she does not have a hx of
   CAD or CHF. Could be pulm edema related to uncontrolled hypertension
   and had a flash episode last night. CXR also concerning for RLL
   pneumonia, and she does have hx of recent CVA and could be aspirating.
   Other etiology on the differential could be PE as she was hospitalized
   recently, but no leg swelling and has been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP as below (vanc/cefepime)
   - TTE today
   # PNA: has RLL infiltrate on CXR.  No leukocytosis, although higher
   than her baseline.  No history of fevers or chills.  Has recently been
   in rehab.  Has no signs of sepsis related to PNA. Legionella urinary
   antigen negative.
   - treat for HAP with vanco/cefepime for now
   - Vanc level 10.3 this AM, change to [**Hospital1 7**] and check level tomorrow
   - consider flagyl if patient decompensates for anaerobic coverage and
   treatment of potential chronic aspiration
   # CHF/Effusion: has what looks like R sided pleural effusion and
   evidence of fluid overload on CXR. Has decreased breath sounds on the
   R, but few crackles. Could either be related to heart failure, which
   seems feasible given her hx of orthopnea. Or could be a parapneumonic
   effusion.
   - TTE in AM
   - would hold on diuresis given ARF and is likely dry
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Check HR in PM; if tolerates may consider Lopressor given
   hypertension requiring nitro drip yesterday. HR in 50s now.
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr of 3.2 from 3.3 yesterday from a
   baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year.  This may be her new baseline
   or may represent some mild pre-renal changes in the setting of an
   infection.
   - Fluid challenge today (500cc), then restart diet
   - would hold on diuresis now, but would also be gentle with IVFs given
   her potential CHF and new effusion
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes, re-check Creatinine in PM
   - will add on Ca/Mg/Phos, Phos okay now.
   - contact outpatient nephrologist, consider renal consult
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 4.8 from 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - F/u PM lytes to ensure stable potassium
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - PT
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes
   -          Start on clears, ADAT
   -          500cc fluid challenge today as above

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and chronic kidney disease. She presents with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) starting two nights ago, pneumonia, and effusion on CXR. She has also developed worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (97°F)
* Heart rate: 61 bpm (58-70 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 159/57 mmHg (83/56-170/74 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 16 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 95%
* SpO2: 95%

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* General: Uncomfortable
* HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, on mask
* Neck: Supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
* Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, decreased lung sounds on the right base, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi
* CV: Distant heart sounds, regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
* Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly, well-healed colostomy scar in LLQ
* GU: Foley
* Ext: Cool, well-perfused, 1+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema, trace edema in bilateral feet

The patient's laboratory results are:

* Hemoglobin: 7.4 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 23.5%
* Platelet count: 207 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 5.3 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 21 mEq/L

   - comfortable on bipap, wean as tolerated today
   - treat for HAP as below
   - consider echo, CT scan for further eval
   # PNA: has RLL infiltrate on CXR.  No leukocytosis, although higher
   than her baseline.  No history of fevers or chills.  Has recently been
   in rehab.  Has no signs of sepsis related to PNA.
   - treat for HAP with vanco/cefepime for now
   - consider flagyl if patient decompensates for anaerobic coverage and

   R, but few crackles.  Could either be related to heart failure, which
   seems feasible given her hx of orthopnea.  Or could be a parapneumonic
   effusion.
   - echo in AM
   - consider CT scan of chest for better clarification of the pneumonia
   and the effusion
   - consider thoracentesis
   - would hold on diuresis given ARF and is likely dry
   # HTN: was hypertensive on admission, which could be contributing to
   edema leading to worsening SOB.  Unclear baseline BP, although last
   progress note says her BP was 130/70.  Was started on nitro gtt in the
   ED.  HR in 50s-60s, so would not tolerate esmolol gtt now.  Only on
   atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control.
   - titrate off nitro gtt as tolerated
   - restart home meds once BP controlled
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: has Cr of 3.3 today up from a
   baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year.  This may be her new baseline
   or may represent some mild pre-renal changes in the setting of an
   infection.
   - urine lytes
   - would hold on diuresis now, but would also be gentle with IVFs given
   her potential CHF and new effusion
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   - will add on Ca/Mg/Phos, based on results consider phos binders
   - contact outpatient nephrologist, consider renal consult
   # Hyperkalemia: has K+ of 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic renal
   failure.  Has high baseline K and EKG has mild peaking of TWs but not
   changed from previous EKGs.  Received kayexcelate in the ED.
   - recheck lytes this afternoon
   - kayexcelate as needed
   - low K+ diet when taking POs
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Imaging: SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is a left ventricular
   configuration of the heart, with aortic enlargement and calcification.
   Although the cardiomediastinal contour is similar to prior studies
   allowing for differences in positioning and AP technique, there is
   increased prominence of vascular markings throughout the lung fields
   and upper zone vascular redistribution
   indicative of of pulmonary edema. There is also a combination of
   effusion and consolidation at both lung bases in comparison to baseline
   radiographs. Evaluation of the left lung apex is limited given
   patient's head positioning. Osseous structures demonstrate moderate
   degenerative changes of the spine and shoulders.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Congestive heart failure.
   2. Bibasilar effusions/atelectasis and consolidations.
   Post-diuresis repeat PA and lateral when clinically feasible is
   recommended.
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease prsents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning.  CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: unclear trigger for new hypoxic
   respiratory failure.  She does not wear oxygen at home, but per report
   has nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic.  This seems likely to be
   orthopnea related to worsening CHF, although she does not have a hx of
   CAD or CHF.  Could be pulm edema related to uncontrolled hypertension
   and had a flash episode last night.  CXR also concerning for RLL
   pneumonia, and she does have hx of recent CVA and could be aspirating.
   Other etiology on the differential could be PE as she was hospitalized
   recently, but no leg swelling and has been ambulating at home.
   - comfortable on bipap, wean as tolerated today
   - treat for HAP as below
   - consider echo, CT scan for further eval
   # PNA: has RLL infiltrate on CXR.  No leukocytosis, although higher
   than her baseline.  No history of fevers or chills.  Has recently been
   in rehab.  Has no signs of sepsis related to PNA.
   - treat for HAP with vanco/cefepime for now
   - consider flagyl if patient decompensates for anaerobic coverage and
   treatment of potential chronic aspiration
   - send legionella urinary antigen
   # CHF/Effusion: has what looks like R sided pleural effusion and
   evidence of fluid overload on CXR.  Has decreased breath sounds on the
   R, but few crackles.  Could either be related to heart failure, which
   seems feasible given her hx of orthopnea.  Or could be a parapneumonic
   effusion.
   - echo in AM
   - consider CT scan of chest for better clarification of the pneumonia
   and the effusion
   - consider thoracentesis
   - would hold on diuresis given ARF and is likely dry
   # HTN: was hypertensive on admission, which could be contributing to
   edema leading to worsening SOB.  Unclear baseline BP, although last
   progress note says her BP was 130/70.  Was started on nitro gtt in the
   ED.  HR in 50s-60s, so would not tolerate esmolol gtt now.  Only on
   atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control.
   - titrate off nitro gtt as tolerated
   - restart home meds once BP controlled
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: has Cr of 3.3 today up from a
   baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year.  This may be her new baseline
   or may represent some mild pre-renal changes in the setting of an
   infection.
   - urine lytes
   - would hold on diuresis now, but would also be gentle with IVFs given
   her potential CHF and new effusion
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   - will add on Ca/Mg/Phos, based on results consider phos binders
   - contact outpatient nephrologist, consider renal consult
   # Hyperkalemia: has K+ of 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic renal
   failure.  Has high baseline K and EKG has mild peaking of TWs but not
   changed from previous EKGs.  Received kayexcelate in the ED.
   - recheck lytes this afternoon
   - kayexcelate as needed
   - low K+ diet when taking POs
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - speech and swallow when respiratory status improves

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted to the ICU with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) starting the previous night and continuing until morning. The patient has a left ventricular configuration of the heart with aortic enlargement and calcification on chest radiograph, indicating congestive heart failure (CHF). She also has bibasilar effusions/atelectasis and consolidations on the chest radiograph.

The patient's laboratory results show worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia. Her white blood cell count (WBC) is 7.2 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) is 7.4 g/dL, and platelet count (Plt) is 242 K/uL. Her creatinine (Cr) is 3.5 mg/dL, and her potassium (K+) is 6.1 mEq/L.

The patient is receiving non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and has been weaned from it. She is also receiving antibiotics for pneumonia and has a pleural effusion on the right side. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recent possible CVA, which may be contributing to her worsening SOB.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's CHF and hypertension can lead to pulmonary edema, which can worsen her shortness of breath and respiratory distress.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and pleural effusion can lead to respiratory failure, which can worsen her shortness of breath and require more aggressive respiratory support.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's CHF and electrolyte imbalances can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, which can worsen her condition and require more aggressive treatment.
4. Renal failure: The patient's worsening renal failure can worsen her electrolyte imbalances and require more aggressive treatment, including dialysis.
5. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and pleural effusion can lead to infection, which can worsen her condition and require more aggressive treatment.
6. Sepsis: The patient's infection can lead to sepsis, which can worsen her condition and require more aggressive treatment.

Based on the patient's condition, it is recommended that she be closely monitored for any signs of worsening respiratory distress, cardiac arrhythmias, or renal failure. She should also be treated with antibiotics for her pneumonia and pleural effusion. Additionally, she should be considered for a cardiac echo and CT scan to better evaluate her cardiac and pulmonary status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Imaging: SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is a left ventricular
   configuration of the heart, with aortic enlargement and calcification.
   Although the cardiomediastinal contour is similar to prior studies
   allowing for differences in positioning and AP technique, there is
   increased prominence of vascular markings throughout the lung fields
   and upper zone vascular redistribution
   indicative of of pulmonary edema. There is also a combination of
   effusion and consolidation at both lung bases in comparison to baseline
   radiographs. Evaluation of the left lung apex is limited given
   patient's head positioning. Osseous structures demonstrate moderate
   degenerative changes of the spine and shoulders.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Congestive heart failure.
   2. Bibasilar effusions/atelectasis and consolidations.
   Post-diuresis repeat PA and lateral when clinically feasible is
   recommended.
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease prsents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning.  CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: unclear trigger for new hypoxic
   respiratory failure. She does not wear oxygen at home, but per report
   has nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic. This seems likely to be
   orthopnea related to worsening CHF, although she does not have a hx of
   CAD or CHF. Could be pulm edema related to uncontrolled hypertension
   and had a flash episode last night. CXR also concerning for RLL
   pneumonia, and she does have hx of recent CVA and could be aspirating.
   Other etiology on the differential could be PE as she was hospitalized
   recently, but no leg swelling and has been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP as below
   - consider echo, CT scan for further eval
   # PNA: has RLL infiltrate on CXR.  No leukocytosis, although higher
   than her baseline.  No history of fevers or chills.  Has recently been
   in rehab.  Has no signs of sepsis related to PNA. Legionella urinary
   antigen negative.
   - treat for HAP with vanco/cefepime for now
   - consider flagyl if patient decompensates for anaerobic coverage and
   treatment of potential chronic aspiration
   # CHF/Effusion: has what looks like R sided pleural effusion and
   evidence of fluid overload on CXR.  Has decreased breath sounds on the
   R, but few crackles.  Could either be related to heart failure, which
   seems feasible given her hx of orthopnea.  Or could be a parapneumonic
   effusion.
   - echo in AM
   - consider CT scan of chest for better clarification of the pneumonia
   and the effusion
   - consider thoracentesis
   - would hold on diuresis given ARF and is likely dry
   # HTN: was hypertensive on admission, which could be contributing to
   edema leading to worsening SOB.  Unclear baseline BP, although last
   progress note says her BP was 130/70.  Was started on nitro gtt in the
   ED.  HR in 50s-60s, so would not tolerate esmolol gtt now.  Only on
   atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control.
   - titrate off nitro gtt as tolerated
   - restart home meds once BP controlled
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: has Cr of 3.3 today up from a
   baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year.  This may be her new baseline
   or may represent some mild pre-renal changes in the setting of an
   infection.
   - urine lytes
   - would hold on diuresis now, but would also be gentle with IVFs given
   her potential CHF and new effusion
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   - will add on Ca/Mg/Phos, based on results consider phos binders
   - contact outpatient nephrologist, consider renal consult
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 4.8 from 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic renal
   failure.  Has high baseline K and EKG has mild peaking of TWs but not
   changed from previous EKGs.  Received kayexcelate in the ED.
   - kayexcelate as needed
   - low K+ diet when taking POs
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - speech and swallow when respiratory status improves

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient, a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease, was admitted to the ICU with worsening shortness of breath starting two nights ago. She was diagnosed with pneumonia and effusion on chest X-ray, as well as worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 95.8°F, heart rate of 61 bpm, and blood pressure of 159/57 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and is on ventilator support with CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lung fields bilaterally, decreased lung sounds on the right base, and no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Her abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended, with normal bowel sounds. She has a Foley catheter in place and is receiving IV fluids.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.2, hemoglobin of 27.0, and platelet count of 242. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with potassium at 4.8 mEq/L, sodium at 112 mEq/L, and chloride at 144 mEq/L. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 23.5 mg/dL, and her creatinine is 3.2 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies reveal a left ventricular configuration of the heart, with aortic enlargement and calcification, as well as pulmonary edema and effusion.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Congestive heart failure (CHF)
2. Bibasilar effusions/atelectasis and consolidations
3. Pneumonia
4. Post-diuresis repeat PA and lateral chest X-ray recommended
5. Acute on chronic renal failure
6. Hyperkalemia
7. Chronic kidney disease
8. Hypertension
9. History of possible CVA/TIA

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory distress
2. Pneumonia-related complications, such as sepsis and respiratory failure
3. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and cardiac arrest
4. Renal complications, such as acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease progression
5. Electrolyte imbalances, such as hyperkalemia and hypokalemia
6. Pulmonary edema and effusion-related complications, such as respiratory failure and cardiac tamponade

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue to wean oxygen therapy as tolerated
2. Treat for HAP with vanco/cefepime for now
3. Consider echo, CT scan for further evaluation
4. Monitor for signs of sepsis and respiratory failure
5. Hold on diuresis given acute on chronic renal failure and hyperkalemia
6. Consider thoracentesis and CT scan of chest for better clarification of pneumonia and effusion
7. Titrate off nitro gtt as tolerated and restart home meds once BP controlled
8. Add on Ca/Mg/Phos and consider phos binders based on results
9. Contact outpatient nephrologist and consider renal consult
10. Monitor for signs of CVA/TIA and consider speech and swallow therapy when respiratory status improves."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Temperature: 35.4°C (95.8°F)
* Heart rate: 60 beats per minute (58-70 beats per minute)
* Blood pressure: 147/40 mmHg (69-98 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute (14-23 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Sinus bradycardia

The patient is still requiring intermittent high-flow mask therapy to maintain oxygenation, but is more comfortable overall.

The patient has a history of anemia, hypertension, and COPD, and is currently being treated for HAP with cefepime and vancomycin. The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.3 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 7.2 K/uL

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition remains stable, but with some challenges in obtaining blood samples due to bruising and pain. The patient is experiencing pain, which is being managed with Tylenol, oxycodone, and a lidocaine patch.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a slight decrease in temperature and blood pressure. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 96% on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC count: 7.2
* Hct: 27.0
* Plt: 180 K/uL
* Cr: 3.5
* TropT: 0.08
* Glucose: 119

The patient is receiving various medications, including vancomycin, cefipime, heparin sodium, and hydralazine.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Infection: The patient is receiving antibiotics, but the risk of infection remains due to the patient's compromised immune system and the presence of central lines.
2. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding, especially with the use of anticoagulant medications like heparin sodium.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is slightly elevated, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications if not managed properly.
4. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium level is slightly low, which can lead to muscle cramps, weakness, and cardiac arrhythmias if not managed properly.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is slightly elevated, which can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis if not managed properly.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding and thrombosis.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the risk of respiratory failure remains due to the patient's underlying condition and the use of sedatives and analgesics.
8. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to the presence of central lines and the risk of infection.
9. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac enzymes are slightly elevated, which increases the risk of cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction and cardiac arrhythmias.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment plans as needed to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease prsents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: unclear trigger for new hypoxic
   respiratory failure. She does not wear oxygen at home, but per report
   has nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic. This seems likely to be
   orthopnea related to worsening CHF, although she does not have a hx of
   CAD or CHF. Could be pulm edema related to uncontrolled hypertension
   and had a flash episode last night. CXR also concerning for RLL
   pneumonia, and she does have hx of recent CVA and could be aspirating.
   Other etiology on the differential could be PE as she was hospitalized
   recently, but no leg swelling and has been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP as below (vanc/cefepime)
   - TTE today
   # PNA: has RLL infiltrate on CXR.  No leukocytosis, although higher
   than her baseline.  No history of fevers or chills.  Has recently been
   in rehab.  Has no signs of sepsis related to PNA. Legionella urinary
   antigen negative.
   - treat for HAP with vanco/cefepime for now
   - Vanc level 10.3 this AM, change to [**Hospital1 7**] and check level tomorrow
   - consider flagyl if patient decompensates for anaerobic coverage and
   treatment of potential chronic aspiration
   # CHF/Effusion: has what looks like R sided pleural effusion and
   evidence of fluid overload on CXR. Has decreased breath sounds on the
   R, but few crackles. Could either be related to heart failure, which
   seems feasible given her hx of orthopnea. Or could be a parapneumonic
   effusion.
   - TTE in AM
   - would hold on diuresis given ARF and is likely dry
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Check HR in PM; if tolerates may consider Lopressor given
   hypertension requiring nitro drip yesterday. HR in 50s now.
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr of 3.2 from 3.3 yesterday from a
   baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year.  This may be her new baseline
   or may represent some mild pre-renal changes in the setting of an
   infection.
   - Fluid challenge today (500cc), then restart diet
   - would hold on diuresis now, but would also be gentle with IVFs given
   her potential CHF and new effusion
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes, re-check Creatinine in PM
   - will add on Ca/Mg/Phos, Phos okay now.
   - contact outpatient nephrologist, consider renal consult
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 4.8 from 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - F/u PM lytes to ensure stable potassium
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - PT
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes
   -          Start on clears, ADAT
   -          500cc fluid challenge today as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   antigen negative.
   - treat for HAP with vanco/cefepime for now
   - Vanc level 10.3 this AM, change to [**Hospital1 7**] and check level tomorrow
   - consider flagyl if patient decompensates for anaerobic coverage and
   treatment of potential chronic aspiration
   # CHF/Effusion: has what looks like R sided pleural effusion and
   evidence of fluid overload on CXR. Has decreased breath sounds on the
   R, but few crackles. Could either be related to heart failure, which
   seems feasible given her hx of orthopnea. Or could be a parapneumonic
   effusion.
   - TTE in AM
   - would hold on diuresis given ARF and is likely dry
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Check HR in PM; if tolerates may consider Lopressor given
   hypertension requiring nitro drip yesterday. HR in 50s now.
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr of 3.2 from 3.3 yesterday from a
   baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year.  This may be her new baseline
   or may represent some mild pre-renal changes in the setting of an
   infection.
   - Fluid challenge today (500cc), then restart diet
   - would hold on diuresis now, but would also be gentle with IVFs given
   her potential CHF and new effusion
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes, re-check Creatinine in PM
   - will add on Ca/Mg/Phos, Phos okay now.
   - contact outpatient nephrologist, consider renal consult
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 4.8 from 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - F/u PM lytes to ensure stable potassium
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 92-year-old female admitted to the ICU with worsening shortness of breath (SOB), pneumonia, and effusion. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease.

The patient's current condition is concerning for hypoxic respiratory distress, with a possible trigger for new hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been experiencing orthopnea, which could be related to worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) or pulmonic edema due to uncontrolled hypertension.

The patient's laboratory results show worsening renal failure with a creatinine level of 3.2 mg/dL, and hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 4.8 mmol/L. She also has a pleural effusion on the right side, which could be related to heart failure or a parapneumonic effusion.

The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin and cefepime for pneumonia, and will undergo a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) today. She will also receive a fluid challenge and will be restarted on a diet. The patient's blood pressure is being closely monitored, and she is being treated with amlodipine and atenolol for hypertension.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening hypoxic respiratory distress could lead to respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of hypertension and possible CVA could lead to cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Renal failure: The patient's worsening renal failure could lead to further complications, such as acidosis, electrolyte imbalances, and an increased risk of infection.
4. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and pleural effusion could lead to further infections, such as sepsis or meningitis.
5. Bleeding: The patient's history of hypertension and possible CVA could lead to bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's hyperkalemia could lead to further electrolyte imbalances, such as hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of hypertension and possible CVA could lead to cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: unclear trigger for new hypoxic
   respiratory failure. She does not wear oxygen at home, but per report
   has nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic. This seems likely to be
   orthopnea related to worsening CHF, although she does not have a hx of

   and had a flash episode last night. CXR also concerning for RLL
   pneumonia, and she does have hx of recent CVA and could be aspirating.
   Other etiology on the differential could be PE as she was hospitalized
   recently, but no leg swelling and has been ambulating at home.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - treat for HAP as below (vanc/cefepime)
   - PICC placement today for antibiotic course
   - TTE today
   .
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Restarted Metoprolol yesterday
   - Given hydral X 1 yesterday for episode of hypertension
   - Will maintain on current regimen today
   .
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr of 3.2 from 3.3 yesterday from a
   baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year.  This may be her new baseline
   or may represent some mild pre-renal changes in the setting of an
   infection.
   - Urine lytes, eval FeNA
   - Will bolus 500 cc over 2 hours
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes, re-check Creatinine in PM
   .
    # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 4.8 from 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic
   renal failure.
   - F/u PM lytes to ensure stable potassium
   .
   # PNA: has RLL infiltrate on CXR.  No leukocytosis, although higher
   than her baseline.  No history of fevers or chills.  Has recently been
   in rehab.  Has no signs of sepsis related to PNA. Legionella urinary
   antigen negative.
   - treat for HAP with vanco/cefepime for now
   - Vanc level pending, if sub-therapeutic will re-dose Vanc today
   .
   # CHF/Effusion: has what looks like R sided pleural effusion and
   evidence of fluid overload on CXR. Has decreased breath sounds on the
   R, but few crackles. Could either be related to heart failure, which
   seems feasible given her hx of orthopnea. Or could be a parapneumonic
   effusion.
   - TTE in AM

Summary:

The patient is a 92-year-old female admitted to the ICU with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) and hypoxic respiratory failure. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and chronic kidney disease. Her condition has deteriorated with worsening renal failure, hyperkalemia, and pneumonia with effusion. She is currently on oxygen therapy, antibiotics, and vasopressors. The patient's lab results show elevated creatinine, potassium, and troponin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient's worsening SOB and hypoxic respiratory failure may lead to further respiratory compromise, including respiratory arrest or failure.
2. Pneumonia with Effusion: The patient's pneumonia with effusion may progress to sepsis, respiratory failure, or cardiac complications.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal function may lead to further electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and cardiovascular complications.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or muscle weakness.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and possible CVA may increase her risk of cardiac complications, including heart failure, myocardial infarction, or arrhythmias.
6. CVA/TIA: The patient's history of CVA/TIA may increase her risk of further cerebrovascular events, including stroke or TIA.
7. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia with effusion may lead to sepsis, which may progress to organ failure, including respiratory, cardiac, or renal failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and adjust oxygen therapy as necessary.
2. Continue antibiotics and adjust dosing based on vancomycin levels.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and electrolyte levels, and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Consider further evaluation of the patient's cardiac function, including a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).
5. Consider further evaluation of the patient's cerebrovascular status, including a repeat CT or MRI scan.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory function and consider further respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation.
7. Consider further evaluation of the patient's gastrointestinal function, including a repeat abdominal CT scan or endoscopy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Pneumonia: Bacterial, community-acquired, with significant desaturation when lying on her right side.
* Hypoxemia: Treated with oxygen therapy.
* Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine levels not showing improvement towards baseline.
* Metabolic Acidosis: Mild, to be closely monitored.
* Pain: Chronic and acute pain from baseline arthritis, managed with pain control medication.
* Other medical issues: COPD, hypertension, and other complications.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of pneumonia, leading to respiratory failure or sepsis.
* Progression of acute renal failure, potentially requiring dialysis.
* Development of metabolic acidosis, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
* Increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and underlying medical conditions.
* Potential for further cardiovascular complications, such as hypertension, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
* Increased risk of infection, particularly in the respiratory tract, given the patient's compromised immune system.
* Potential for worsening of chronic conditions, such as COPD, which can further compromise the patient's respiratory function.

Given the patient's critical illness and complex medical history, close monitoring and management of her condition are essential to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure. Pt without O2 requirement at home but some history of
   nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic. PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening
   CHF. CXR concerning for RLL pneumonia and has hx of recent CVA and
   could be aspirating. No leukocytosis at first but now climbing. No
   fever or chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural
   effusion concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of
   fluid overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided
   effusion, but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury.
   Has decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 4 of 7 day
   course
   - Adding ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: seen on echo [**3-2**].  Likely related to COPD
   history.
   - Continue on current regimen
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Restarted Metoprolol yesterday
   - Will maintain on current regimen today
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr appearing stable at 3.3 vs
   baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year. Possibly new baseline vs
   acute pre-renal etiology
 FEUrea borderline pre-renal.  Developing PNA
   could be causing her to be volume down.
   -          continue to to trend, f/u urine lytes
   -          support with IVF for goal of 1L positive today
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.0 from 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - F/u PM lytes to ensure stable potassium
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with severe tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and mild aortic valve stenosis. They have been admitted to the ICU and have received various treatments, including antibiotics, heparin, and vasopressors. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 129/47 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with an SpO2 of 94% and ABG results of 21%. The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiovascular: The patient's severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary arterial hypertension increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory: The patient's mild aortic valve stenosis and tricuspid regurgitation may lead to respiratory compromise, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels suggest potential sepsis, which may lead to multi-organ failure.
4. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy with heparin increases the risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and retroperitoneal bleeding.
5. Renal: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest potential kidney injury, which may lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
6. Gastrointestinal: The patient's elevated lactate levels and potential sepsis may lead to gastrointestinal complications, including necrotizing enterocolitis and gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Neurological: The patient's elevated lactate levels and potential sepsis may lead to neurological complications, including stroke, seizures, and encephalopathy.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely, including heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac enzymes.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely, including oxygen saturation, ABG results, and respiratory rate.
3. Monitor the patient's laboratory results, including white blood cell count, lactate levels, and creatinine levels.
4. Continue anticoagulation therapy with heparin and monitor for bleeding complications.
5. Consider adjusting the patient's antibiotics and antifungals based on the results of blood cultures and other laboratory tests.
6. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider adjusting the patient's diet and supplements as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's glycemic control and consider adjusting the patient's insulin and glucose levels as necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely, including mental status, motor function, and sensory function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary arterial hypertension. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure of 129/47 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's respiratory support consists of nasal cannula oxygen delivery. The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, normal kidney function, and elevated troponin levels. The patient's echocardiogram reveals left ventricular hypertrophy, mild aortic valve stenosis, and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary arterial hypertension increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen delivery may not be sufficient to maintain adequate oxygenation, leading to respiratory failure and respiratory arrest.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
4. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy with heparin sodium increases the risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and epistaxis.
5. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increase the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
6. Neurological complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels and cardiac complications increase the risk of neurological complications, including stroke, seizures, and encephalopathy.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and immobilization increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, including constipation, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to prevent and manage these potential medical complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary arterial hypertension. The patient had a trans-thoracic echo done which showed severe tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 65%. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium, vancomycin, and cefipime antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 129/47 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 94% and ABG results of pH 7.21. The patient's physical examination is notable for coarse upper airway sounds, scattered crackles, and right upper arm swelling with ecchymoses.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary arterial hypertension increase the risk of cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's coarse upper airway sounds and scattered crackles increase the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure.
3. Thrombotic complications: The patient's severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary arterial hypertension increase the risk of thrombotic complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
4. Infectious complications: The patient's use of antibiotics and prophylactic medications increases the risk of infectious complications such as sepsis, septic shock, and multi-organ failure.
5. Nutritional complications: The patient's inability to eat orally increases the risk of nutritional complications such as malnutrition, electrolyte imbalance, and wound complications.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's ostomy output and abdominal distension increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, and hemorrhage.
7. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary arterial hypertension increase the risk of hemodynamic instability, including hypotension, hypertension, and cardiac arrest.

Based on the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results, it is essential to monitor the patient closely for any signs of cardiac, respiratory, thrombotic, infectious, nutritional, gastrointestinal, or hemodynamic complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease prsents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure. Pt without O2 requirement at home but some history of
   nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic. PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening
   CHF. CXR concerning for RLL pneumonia and has hx of recent CVA and
   could be aspirating. No leukocytosis at first but now climbing. No
   fever or chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural
   effusion concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of
   fluid overload on CXR. Has decreased breath sounds on the R, but few
   crackles. New echo with severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology
   on the differential could be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but
   no leg swelling and has been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 4 of 7 day
   course
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Restarted Metoprolol yesterday
   - Will maintain on current regimen today
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr appearing stable at 3.3 vs
   baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year. Possibly new baseline vs
   acute pre-renal etiology
 FEUrea borderline pre-renal.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes, re-check Creatinine in PM
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.0 from 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - F/u PM lytes to ensure stable potassium
    # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - PT
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes
   -          Start on clears, ADAT

   effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease prsents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure. Pt without O2 requirement at home but some history of
   nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic. PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening
   CHF. CXR concerning for RLL pneumonia and has hx of recent CVA and
   could be aspirating. No leukocytosis at first but now climbing. No
   fever or chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural
   effusion concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of
   fluid overload on CXR. Has decreased breath sounds on the R, but few
   crackles. New echo with severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology
   on the differential could be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but
   no leg swelling and has been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 4 of 7 day
   course
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Restarted Metoprolol yesterday
   - Will maintain on current regimen today
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr appearing stable at 3.3 vs
   baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year. Possibly new baseline vs
   acute pre-renal etiology
 FEUrea borderline pre-renal.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes, re-check Creatinine in PM
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.0 from 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - F/u PM lytes to ensure stable potassium
    # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - PT
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a complicated medical history, admitted to the ICU with RLL pneumonia and hypoxemia. She is still desaturating when lying on her right side and reports ongoing hand and arm pain. Her recent trans-thoracic echo showed moderate-severe TR, severe PA-HTN, and an EF of 60-65%. She has been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefipime, and has a PICC line planned. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, and blood pressure of 157/48 mmHg. She has a Foley catheter in place and is receiving fluid support.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is not improving, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure and sepsis.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is not resolving, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure and cardiac complications.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is ongoing, and there is a risk of worsening kidney function and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's PA-HTN and TR may be contributing to her hypoxemia and acute renal failure, and there is a risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias.
5. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and acute renal failure may be contributing to her sepsis, and there is a risk of worsening organ dysfunction and mortality.
6. Thromboembolic Events: The patient's immobilization and medical history may increase her risk of thromboembolic events, such as DVT and PE.
7. Nutritional Complications: The patient's poor oral intake and requirement for IV fluids may lead to nutritional deficiencies and electrolyte imbalances.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and aggressive management of the patient's respiratory, cardiac, and renal function."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure. Pt without O2 requirement at home but some history of
   nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic. PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening
   CHF. CXR concerning for RLL pneumonia and has hx of recent CVA and
   could be aspirating. No leukocytosis at first but now climbing. No
   fever or chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural
   effusion concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of
   fluid overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided
   effusion, but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury.
   Has decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 4 of 7 day
   course
   - Adding ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: seen on echo [**3-2**].  Likely related to COPD
   history.
   - Continue on current regimen
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Restarted Metoprolol yesterday
   - Will maintain on current regimen today
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr appearing stable at 3.3 vs
   baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year. Possibly new baseline vs
   acute pre-renal etiology
 FEUrea borderline pre-renal.  Developing PNA
   could be causing her to be volume down.
   -          continue to to trend, f/u urine lytes
   -          support with IVF for goal of 1L positive today
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.0 from 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - F/u PM lytes to ensure stable potassium
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - PT once able
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes
   -          Start on clears, ADAT
   -          500cc fluid challenge today as above
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure. Pt without O2 requirement at home but some history of
   nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic. PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening
   CHF. CXR concerning for RLL pneumonia and has hx of recent CVA and
   could be aspirating. No leukocytosis at first but now climbing. No
   fever or chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural
   effusion concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of
   fluid overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided
   effusion, but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury.
   Has decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 4 of 7 day
   course
   - Adding ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: seen on echo [**3-2**].  Likely related to COPD
   history.
   - Continue on current regimen
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Restarted Metoprolol yesterday
   - Will maintain on current regimen today
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr appearing stable at 3.3 vs
   baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year. Possibly new baseline vs
   acute pre-renal etiology
 FEUrea borderline pre-renal.  Developing PNA
   could be causing her to be volume down.
   -          continue to to trend, f/u urine lytes
   -          support with IVF for goal of 1L positive today
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.0 from 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - F/u PM lytes to ensure stable potassium
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - PT once able
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes
   -          Start on clears, ADAT
   -          500cc fluid challenge today as above
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals, needs PICC today

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease. She presents with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) starting last night and continuing until morning, which is worsening hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of nighttime SOB, which may be chronic.

The patient has a CXR with evidence of pneumonia and effusion, and worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia. The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 7.2-11.5 K/uL
* Hct: 27.0-30.7%
* Plt: 87-155 K/uL
* Cr: 3.1-3.5 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.08 ng/mL
* Glucose: 87-144 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 11.5/27.8/1.0, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 49/0.08, Alk Phos/T Bili: 0.4, Ca++/Mg++/PO4: 8.1/2.2/6.0 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: continue to wean O2 as tolerated, treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, and add ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP.
* Pulmonary Hypertension: continue on current regimen.
* HTN: unclear baseline BP, restarted amlodipine, and will maintain on current regimen today.
* Acute on chronic Renal Failure: continue to trend, f/u urine lytes, and support with IVF for goal of 1L positive today.
* Hyperkalemia: f/u PM lytes to ensure stable potassium.
* CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
* FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, start on clears, ADAT, and 500cc fluid challenge today.
* Prophylaxis: subcutaneous heparin.
* Access: peripherals, needs PICC today.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening respiratory failure
* Pneumonia progression
* Pulmonary hypertension exacerbation
* Renal failure worsening
* Hyperkalemia
* Electrolyte imbalance
* CVA/TIA recurrence
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
* Stress ulcer

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a PICC line inserted and receiving antibiotics, heparin, and other medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, and blood pressure of 129/45 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 90% on 4L oxygen. The patient's lab results show normal to slightly elevated values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, and his kidney function is slightly impaired. The patient's cardiac enzymes are normal, and his troponin level is slightly elevated.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and antibiotic use suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is slightly low, which may indicate thrombocytopenia.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's slightly impaired kidney function and elevated creatinine level suggest the possibility of AKI.
4. Hypocalcemia: The patient's low calcium level may indicate hypocalcemia, which can be a complication of sepsis or AKI.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but the possibility of electrolyte imbalance cannot be ruled out.
6. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory status and use of a nasal cannula oxygen delivery device suggest the possibility of VAP.
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's use of heparin and prophylactic measures suggest the possibility of DVT.
8. Stress Ulcer: The patient's use of stress ulcer prophylaxis suggests the possibility of stress ulcer.
9. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac enzymes are normal, but the possibility of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, cannot be ruled out."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with a PICC line inserted. The patient experienced brief desaturation after the PICC procedure, which resolved with repositioning. The patient is receiving various medications, including sevelamer and sodium bicarbonate, and has a history of allergies to iodine, Lipitor, and arthralgia/arth. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, and blood pressure of 129/45 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 90% on 4L oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia (Hct 27.9%), mild thrombocytopenia (Platelet count 87,000/μL), and mild elevation of creatinine (3.3 mg/dL). The patient's troponin-T level is normal (0.08 ng/mL).

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 90% on 4L oxygen, indicating mild hypoxemia. This could lead to respiratory failure if not addressed.
2. Sepsis: The patient's temperature is 36.1°C, which is slightly below normal. This could indicate an underlying infection, such as sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ failure.
3. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is 87,000/μL, which is mildly low. This could increase the risk of bleeding, especially if the patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy.
4. Kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is mildly elevated (3.3 mg/dL), which could indicate kidney injury or damage.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's troponin-T level is normal, but the patient's cardiac rhythm is abnormal (1st AV block), which could increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory status to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure with recent history of nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic.
   PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening CHF but CXR concerning for RLL
   pneumonia. No leukocytosis at first but now borderline. No fever or
   chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural effusion
   concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of fluid
   overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided effusion,
   but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. Has
   decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.  Pt. had acute hypoxia in the morning of [**3-4**].
   - F/U stat CXR and ABG
   - Lasix one time dose
   - check EKG
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 4 of 7 day
   course
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Continue Metoprolol
   - Continue current regimen
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr slightly improved at 3.1 from 3.3
   yesterday with more fluids, recent baseline in the mid 2s earlier this
   year. Possibly new baseline vs acute pre-renal etiology.  FENa
   yesterday was 1.2% (equivocal)
   - goal negative 500cc today
   - aim to reach goal with POs alone, supplement if needed
   - restarting NaHCO3 for chronic renal acidosis, HCO3s hovering around
   21 recently
   # Hyperphospatemia: [**1-13**] ARF
   - start sevelamer
   - low phosphorous diet
   - pt to f/u with outpatient renal
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.1 from 6.1on admission in setting of acute on
   chronic renal failure.
   - check PM lytes
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: seen on echo [**3-2**].  No history of COPD or
   other documented lung disease.
   -          Continue on current regimen
   -          - Will need outpatient pulmonologist
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - PT once able
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes
    -low phosph, low potassium diet
    -IVF only if needed to maintain fluid goal as above
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals, PICC [**2122-3-3**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted with worsening SOB starting last night and continuing until morning. CXR showed evidence of pneumonia and effusion. The patient has worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia. She has acute hypoxia in the morning and was treated with Lasix, oxygen, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient's worsening hypoxic respiratory failure is a concern, especially given her recent history of nighttime SOB.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's CXR shows evidence of pneumonia, which may be complicated by the presence of a parapneumonic effusion.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, which may be related to her acute on chronic renal failure.
4. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's echocardiogram shows evidence of pulmonary hypertension, which may be contributing to her hypoxia.
5. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease may be exacerbated by her acute on chronic renal failure and hyperkalemia.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid overload may be contributing to her hypoxia and respiratory distress.
7. CVA/TIA History: The patient's history of possible CVA/TIA may be relevant to her current condition, especially given her worsening renal function.
8. Hyperphospatemia: The patient's elevated phosphate levels may be related to her chronic kidney disease and may require treatment with sevelamer and a low-phosphorus diet.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and adjust her oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's pneumonia with antibiotics and consider adding a second antibiotic if the patient's symptoms do not improve.
3. Monitor the patient's potassium levels and adjust her treatment accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her fluid management and electrolyte replacement as needed.
5. Consider consulting a pulmonologist to help manage the patient's pulmonary hypertension.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's CVA/TIA history and consider consulting a neurologist if the patient's symptoms worsen.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's hyperphospatemia and adjust her treatment accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure with recent history of nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic.
   PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening CHF but CXR concerning for RLL
   pneumonia. No leukocytosis at first but now borderline. No fever or
   chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural effusion
   concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of fluid
   overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided effusion,
   but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. Has
   decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 4 of 7 day
   course
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Continue Metoprolol
   - Continue current regimen
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr slightly improved at 3.1 from 3.3
   yesterday with more fluids, recent baseline in the mid 2s earlier this
   year. Possibly new baseline vs acute pre-renal etiology.
   - goal even to net positive 500cc today
   - aim to reach goal with POs alone, supplement if needed
   - restarting NaHCO3 for chronic renal acidosis, HCO3s hovering around
   21 recently
   # Hyperphospatemia: [**1-13**] ARF
   - start sevelamer
   - low phosphorous diet
   - pt to f/u with outpatient renal
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.1 from 6.1on admission in setting of acute on
   chronic renal failure.
   - check PM lytes
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: seen on echo [**3-2**].  No history of COPD or
   other documented lung disease.
   - Continue on current regimen
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - PT once able
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes
    -low phosph, low potassium diet
    -IVF only if needed to maintain fluid goal as above
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals, needs PICC today

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and chronic kidney disease. She presents with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) starting last night and continuing until morning, along with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.

The patient has a CXR with evidence of pneumonia and effusion, and a bedside ultrasound shows a right-sided effusion, likely concerning for parapneumonic effusion. She also has severe TR and pulmonary artery hypertension on echo.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (97°F)
* Heart rate: 72 bpm (59-80 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 129/45 mmHg (65-174/58-87 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 23 inspirations per minute (14-27)
* SpO2: 90%

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.2-10.9 K/μL
* Hemoglobin: 8.8-32.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 87-155 K/μL
* Creatinine: 3.1-3.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.08 ng/mL
* Glucose: 119-144 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 6.0 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Heparin sodium (prophylaxis)
* Metoprolol
* Atenolol
* Amlodipine
* Ciprofloxacin
* Vancomycin
* Cefepime
* Sevelamer
* Sodium bicarbonate

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: worsening hypoxic respiratory failure with recent history of nighttime SOB.
2. Pneumonia: CXR with evidence of pneumonia and effusion.
3. Parapneumonic effusion: likely concerning for parapneumonic effusion on bedside ultrasound.
4. Pulmonary hypertension: severe TR and pulmonary artery hypertension on echo.
5. Acute on chronic renal failure: creatinine slightly improved at 3.1 from 3.3 yesterday with more fluids.
6. Hyperphosphatemia: ARF, with phosphate levels hovering around 6.0 mg/dL.
7. Hyperkalemia: potassium levels at 5.1 from 6.1 on admission in setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
8. CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Continue to wean O2 as tolerated.
2. Treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 4 of 7-day course.
3. Continue ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP.
4. Continue metoprolol.
5. Continue current regimen for HTN.
6. Goal even to net positive 500cc today.
7. Aim to reach goal with POs alone, supplement if needed.
8. Restart NaHCO3 for chronic renal acidosis.
9. Start sevelamer for hyperphosphatemia.
10. Low phosphorous diet.
11. Check PM lytes.
12. Continue on current regimen for pulmonary hypertension.
13. Restart PT once able.
14. IVF, replete electrolytes.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure with recent history of nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic.
   PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening CHF but CXR concerning for RLL
   pneumonia. No leukocytosis at first but now borderline. No fever or
   chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural effusion
   concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of fluid
   overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided effusion,
   but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. Has
   decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 4 of 7 day
   course
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Continue Metoprolol
   - Continue current regimen
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr slightly improved at 3.1 from 3.3
   yesterday with more fluids, recent baseline in the mid 2s earlier this
   year. Possibly new baseline vs acute pre-renal etiology.
   - goal even to net positive 500cc today
   - aim to reach goal with POs alone, supplement if needed
   - restarting NaHCO3 for chronic renal acidosis, HCO3s hovering around
   21 recently
   # Hyperphospatemia: [**1-13**] ARF
   - start sevelamer
   - low phosphorous diet
   - pt to f/u with outpatient renal
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.1 from 6.1on admission in setting of acute on
   chronic renal failure.
   - check PM lytes
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: seen on echo [**3-2**].  No history of COPD or
   other documented lung disease.
   - Continue on current regimen
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - PT once able
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes
    -low phosph, low potassium diet
    -IVF only if needed to maintain fluid goal as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure with recent history of nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic.
   PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening CHF but CXR concerning for RLL
   pneumonia. No leukocytosis at first but now borderline. No fever or
   chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural effusion
   concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of fluid
   overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided effusion,
   but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. Has
   decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 4 of 7 day
   course
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Continue Metoprolol
   - Continue current regimen
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr slightly improved at 3.1 from 3.3
   yesterday with more fluids, recent baseline in the mid 2s earlier this
   year. Possibly new baseline vs acute pre-renal etiology.
   - goal even to net positive 500cc today
   - aim to reach goal with POs alone, supplement if needed
   - restarting NaHCO3 for chronic renal acidosis, HCO3s hovering around
   21 recently
   # Hyperphospatemia: [**1-13**] ARF
   - start sevelamer
   - pt to f/u with outpatient renal
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.1 from 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - check PM lytes
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: seen on echo [**3-2**].  No history of COPD or
   other documented lung disease.
   - Continue on current regimen
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - PT once able
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes
   -          Start on clears, ADAT
   -          500cc fluid challenge today as above
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals, needs PICC today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure with recent history of nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic.
   PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening CHF but CXR concerning for RLL
   pneumonia. No leukocytosis at first but now borderline. No fever or
   chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural effusion
   concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of fluid
   overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided effusion,
   but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. Has
   decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 4 of 7 day
   course
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Continue Metoprolol
   - Continue current regimen
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr slightly improved at 3.1 from 3.3
   yesterday with more fluids, recent baseline in the mid 2s earlier this
   year. Possibly new baseline vs acute pre-renal etiology.
   - goal even to net positive 500cc today
   - aim to reach goal with POs alone, supplement if needed
   - restarting NaHCO3 for chronic renal acidosis, HCO3s hovering around
   21 recently
   # Hyperphospatemia: [**1-13**] ARF
   - start sevelamer
   - pt to f/u with outpatient renal
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.1 from 6.1 in setting of acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - check PM lytes
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: seen on echo [**3-2**].  No history of COPD or
   other documented lung disease.
   - Continue on current regimen
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - PT once able
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes
   -          Start on clears, ADAT
   -          500cc fluid challenge today as above
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals, needs PICC today

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted with worsening shortness of breath, pneumonia, and effusion. The patient has developed hypoxic respiratory distress, hyperkalemia, and acute on chronic renal failure. She is also at risk for pulmonary hypertension, CVA/TIA, and fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient's worsening hypoxic respiratory failure is a critical concern. If not addressed promptly, it may lead to respiratory arrest and cardiac arrest.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to sepsis, septic shock, and multi-organ failure.
3. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension may worsen, leading to right heart failure, cardiac arrest, and death.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may worsen, leading to uremic crisis, acidosis, and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and death.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid overload may worsen, leading to pulmonary edema, cardiac failure, and death.
7. CVA/TIA: The patient's CVA/TIA history may increase her risk of stroke, bleeding, and neurological deficits.
8. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and effusion may lead to secondary infections, such as sepsis, septic shock, and multi-organ failure.
9. Medication Side Effects: The patient's medications, such as nitroglycerin, may cause hypotension, tachycardia, and other adverse effects.
10. Poor Nutrition: The patient's poor nutrition may worsen her malnutrition, leading to muscle wasting, weakness, and impaired wound healing.

To mitigate these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring, aggressive treatment of her underlying conditions, and careful management of her medications and fluids."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with a complicated medical history, admitted to the ICU with right lower lobe (RLL) pneumonia, hypoxemia, and acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, and blood pressure of 113/33 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 97% on 100% NRB.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, with symmetric chest expansion and crackles bibasilarly. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, and her extremities show no signs of edema.

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.8 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 7.2-11.5 K/uL
* Platelet count: 87-155 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.1-3.3 mg/dL
* Trop-T: 0.08 ng/mL
* Glucose: 87-144 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include pneumonia, acute renal failure, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She is receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime, and has been weaned off oxygen therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is not improving as expected, and there is a risk of progression to multi-organ failure.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are trending down, but she remains at risk for further deterioration in renal function.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is stable, but she is at risk for desaturation due to shunting through the RLL.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is controlled, but she is at risk for hypertension-related complications.
5. COPD: The patient's COPD is a chronic condition that can exacerbate her pneumonia and other medical conditions.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her medical conditions to prevent complications and improve her outcome."

   24 Hour Events:
   Pt. had acute desaturation to 80s during rounds with increased SOB.
   Stat CXR done which showed maybe some worsening. Added 80% face mask to
   her 5LNC with improvement in oxygenation. Her breathing became less
   labored.  She was weaned back to 5L NC. BNP elevated, but in the
   setting of her somewhat worsening renal failure she was not further
   diuresed. She had a repeat EKG for K of 5.5 without evidence of peaked

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure with recent history of nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic.
   PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening CHF but CXR concerning for RLL
   pneumonia. No leukocytosis at first but now borderline. No fever or
   chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural effusion
   concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of fluid
   overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided effusion,
   but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. Has
   decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.  Pt. had acute hypoxia in the morning of [**3-4**]
   treated with lasix with some improvement but deteriorating renal
   function.
   - Will consider non-contrast CT later in the day if able to tolerate,
   but suspect that she will not be able to
   - no more lasix for now
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 4 of 7 day
   course
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP
   .
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr 3.4 this AM after mild diuresis
   this AM, recent baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year. Possibly new
   baseline vs acute pre-renal etiology.  FENa yesterday was 1.2%
   (equivocal)
   - No diuresis today
   - aim to reach goal with POs alone, supplement if needed
   - restarting NaHCO3 for chronic renal acidosis, HCO3s hovering around
   21 recently
   - Will consult renal this AM for etiology of acute on chronic kidney
   injury
   .
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Continue Metoprolol
   - Continue current regimen
   .
   # Hyperphospatemia: [**1-13**] ARF
   - start sevelamer
   - low phosphorous diet
   - pt to f/u with outpatient renal
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.1 from 6.1on admission in setting of acute on
   chronic renal failure.
   - Kayexelate given this AM
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: seen on echo [**3-2**].  No history of COPD or
   other documented lung disease.
    - Continue on current regimen
    - Will need outpatient pulmonologist
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - PT once able

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt. had acute desaturation to 80s during rounds with increased SOB.
   Stat CXR done which showed maybe some worsening. Added 80% face mask to
   her 5LNC with improvement in oxygenation. Her breathing became less
   labored.  She was weaned back to 5L NC. BNP elevated, but in the
   setting of her somewhat worsening renal failure she was not further
   diuresed. She had a repeat EKG for K of 5.5 without evidence of peaked

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure with recent history of nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic.
   PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening CHF but CXR concerning for RLL
   pneumonia. No leukocytosis at first but now borderline. No fever or
   chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural effusion
   concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of fluid
   overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided effusion,
   but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. Has
   decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.  Pt. had acute hypoxia in the morning of [**3-4**]
   treated with lasix with some improvement but deteriorating renal
   function.
   - Will consider non-contrast CT later in the day if able to tolerate,
   but suspect that she will not be able to
   - no more lasix for now
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 4 of 7 day
   course
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP
   .
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr 3.4 this AM after mild diuresis
   this AM, recent baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year. Possibly new
   baseline vs acute pre-renal etiology.  FENa yesterday was 1.2%
   (equivocal)
   - No diuresis today
   - aim to reach goal with POs alone, supplement if needed
   - restarting NaHCO3 for chronic renal acidosis, HCO3s hovering around
   21 recently
   - Will consult renal this AM for etiology of acute on chronic kidney
   injury
   .
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Continue Metoprolol
   - Continue current regimen
   .
   # Hyperphospatemia: [**1-13**] ARF
   - start sevelamer
   - low phosphorous diet
   - pt to f/u with outpatient renal
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.1 from 6.1on admission in setting of acute on
   chronic renal failure.
   - Kayexelate given this AM
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes

   # Pulmonary Hypertension: seen on echo [**3-2**].  No history of COPD or
   other documented lung disease.
    - Continue on current regimen

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and chronic kidney disease, who presents with worsening SOB, pneumonia, effusion, and worsening renal failure.

The patient's acute condition includes:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory failure with recent history of nighttime SOB.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Cr 3.4 this AM after mild diuresis this AM, recent baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year.
3. Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.1 from 6.1 on admission in setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
4. Pulmonary Hypertension: seen on echo, no history of COPD or other documented lung disease.
5. Hyperphospatemia: [**1-13**] ARF

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: worsening hypoxic respiratory failure can lead to respiratory arrest or cardiac arrest.
2. Renal failure: worsening renal failure can lead to further electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and potential cardiac complications.
3. Cardiac complications: pulmonary hypertension can lead to right heart failure, and hyperkalemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Infections: pneumonia and effusion can lead to sepsis, and hyperphospatemia can increase the risk of infections.

The plan of care includes:

1. Treatment for HAP with vanc and cefepime.
2. Continue ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP.
3. No more lasix for now.
4. Continue to wean O2 as tolerated.
5. Restarting NaHCO3 for chronic renal acidosis.
6. Will consult renal this AM for etiology of acute on chronic kidney injury.
7. Continue Metoprolol and amlodipine.
8. Start sevelamer and low phosphorous diet for hyperphospatemia.
9. Kayexelate given this AM for hyperkalemia.
10. Continue on current regimen for pulmonary hypertension.
11. Will need outpatient pulmonologist.
12. FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, low phosph, low potassium diet, and IVF only if needed to maintain fluid goal.

The patient will require close monitoring of her respiratory, renal, and cardiac status, as well as ongoing treatment and management of her underlying conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65 kg individual admitted to the ICU with worsening respiratory failure, requiring 80% face mask oxygenation and mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 128/45 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's renal function is compromised, with an elevated BNP level. The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, diuretics, and anticoagulants.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is worsening, requiring increased oxygenation and mechanical ventilation. This increases the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
2. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, which increases the risk of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Infection: The patient is receiving antibiotics, which may not be effective against the underlying infection. This increases the risk of treatment failure and sepsis.
5. Fluid overload: The patient is receiving fluid infusions, which may lead to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's heart rate and blood pressure are stable, but the patient's cardiac status is compromised, which increases the risk of cardiovascular instability and arrhythmias.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to the use of anticoagulants and the presence of gastrointestinal ulcers.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, which increases the risk of malnutrition and related complications.
9. Medication errors: The patient is receiving multiple medications, which increases the risk of medication errors and interactions.
10. Psychological distress: The patient is critically ill and may be experiencing psychological distress, which can affect their overall well-being and recovery."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure with recent history of nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic.
   PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening CHF but CXR concerning for RLL
   pneumonia. No leukocytosis at first but now borderline. No fever or
   chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural effusion
   concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of fluid
   overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided effusion,
   but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. Has
   decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.  Pt. had acute hypoxia in the morning of [**3-4**].
   - non-contrast CT scan
   - Lasix one time dose
   - check EKG
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 4 of 7 day
   course
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Continue Metoprolol
   - Continue current regimen
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr slightly improved at 3.1 from 3.3
   yesterday with more fluids, recent baseline in the mid 2s earlier this
   year. Possibly new baseline vs acute pre-renal etiology.  FENa
   yesterday was 1.2% (equivocal)
   - goal negative 500cc today
   - aim to reach goal with POs alone, supplement if needed
   - restarting NaHCO3 for chronic renal acidosis, HCO3s hovering around
   21 recently
   # Hyperphospatemia: [**1-13**] ARF
   - start sevelamer
   - low phosphorous diet
   - pt to f/u with outpatient renal
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.1 from 6.1on admission in setting of acute on
   chronic renal failure.
   - check PM lytes
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: seen on echo [**3-2**].  No history of COPD or
   other documented lung disease.
   -          Continue on current regimen
   -          - Will need outpatient pulmonologist
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - PT once able
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes
    -low phosph, low potassium diet
    -IVF only if needed to maintain fluid goal as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) and was found to have pneumonia and effusion on chest X-ray. Her condition has worsened, with increasing SOB, hypoxia, and hyperkalemia. She has acute on chronic renal failure, and her potassium levels have increased to 5.1 mmol/L. Her creatinine levels have improved slightly, but she remains at risk for further decline. She has been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, and her echocardiogram shows severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary artery hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening SOB and hypoxia put her at risk for respiratory failure, which could lead to intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's pulmonary hypertension and tricuspid regurgitation increase her risk for cardiac complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure increases her risk for further decline in kidney function, which could lead to the need for dialysis.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia put her at risk for further electrolyte imbalances, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
5. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and effusion increase her risk for infection, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
6. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's recent hospitalization and immobility increase her risk for pulmonary embolism, which could lead to respiratory failure and death.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia increase her risk for cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction and stroke.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's chronic kidney disease and malnutrition increase her risk for nutritional deficiencies, which could lead to further decline in her condition.

Based on this information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure with recent history of nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic.
   PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening CHF but CXR concerning for RLL
   pneumonia. No leukocytosis at first but now borderline. No fever or
   chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural effusion
   concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of fluid
   overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided effusion,
   but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. Has
   decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.  Pt. had acute hypoxia in the morning of [**3-4**]
   treated with lasix with some improvement but deteriorating renal
   function.
   - order non-contrast CT scan to further characterize PNA
   - no more lasix for now
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 4 of 7 day
   course
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Continue Metoprolol
   - Continue current regimen
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr slightly improved at 3.1 from 3.3
   yesterday with more fluids, recent baseline in the mid 2s earlier this
   year. Possibly new baseline vs acute pre-renal etiology.  FENa
   yesterday was 1.2% (equivocal)
   - goal negative 500cc today
   - aim to reach goal with POs alone, supplement if needed
   - restarting NaHCO3 for chronic renal acidosis, HCO3s hovering around
   21 recently
   # Hyperphospatemia: [**1-13**] ARF
   - start sevelamer
   - low phosphorous diet
   - pt to f/u with outpatient renal
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.1 from 6.1on admission in setting of acute on
   chronic renal failure.
   - check PM lytes
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: seen on echo [**3-2**].  No history of COPD or
   other documented lung disease.
    - Continue on current regimen
    - Will need outpatient pulmonologist
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - PT once able
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes
    -low phosph, low potassium diet
    -IVF only if needed to maintain fluid goal as above

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications and concerns have arisen:

1. Worsening Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient's oxygen saturation levels decreased to 80s during rounds, indicating worsening hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's chest X-ray shows evidence of pneumonia and effusion, which may be contributing to the respiratory distress.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased to 3.1, indicating worsening renal function. The patient's potassium levels are also elevated, which may be contributing to the worsening renal function.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated at 5.1, which may be contributing to the patient's worsening renal function and respiratory distress.
4. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's echocardiogram shows evidence of pulmonary hypertension, which may be contributing to the patient's worsening respiratory distress.
5. Fluid Overload: The patient's chest X-ray shows evidence of fluid overload, which may be contributing to the patient's respiratory distress and worsening renal function.
6. Parapneumonic Effusion: The patient's bedside ultrasound shows evidence of a right-sided effusion, which may be contributing to the patient's respiratory distress.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may be contributing to the patient's worsening renal function and respiratory distress.
8. Hyperphospatemia: The patient's phosphorus levels are elevated, which may be contributing to the patient's worsening renal function.

The patient's medical team has ordered the following interventions:

1. Non-contrast CT scan to further characterize the patient's pneumonia.
2. No further diuresis with Lasix at this time.
3. Continue weaning oxygen as tolerated.
4. Treat for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin and cefepime.
5. Continue ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP.
6. Restart amlodipine to control hypertension.
7. Continue metoprolol to control hypertension.
8. Start sevelamer to treat hyperphospatemia.
9. Order low-phosphorus diet.
10. Restart NaHCO3 for chronic renal acidosis.
11. Monitor patient's electrolyte levels closely.

The patient's medical team has also discussed the patient's code status and disposition, and has decided to keep the patient in the ICU for further management and monitoring."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   24 Hour Events:
   Pt remained delerious through the day, thought to be related to
   trazodone also w/ ICU and ? uremia contributing. Dr. [**Name (NI) 1788**], Pt's
   outpatient nephrologist was consulted. Although initially renal fellow
   thought she was likely hypovolemic, he thought Pt was likely volume
   overloaded. He suggested holding amlodipine (which was d/c) to increase
   MAP and see if that improves UOP. He also suggested that we initiate
   discussions with the family and Pt about short-term hemodialysis.
   Although there is not currently a need for HD, if the Pt remains
   oliguric she may ultimately benefit from short term HD, if this is
   within goals of care for the family.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure with recent history of nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic.
   PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening CHF but CXR concerning for RLL
   pneumonia. No leukocytosis at first but now borderline. No fever or
   chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural effusion
   concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of fluid
   overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided effusion,
   but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. Has
   decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.  Pt. had acute hypoxia in the morning of [**3-4**]
   treated with lasix with some improvement but deteriorating renal
   function.
   - Will consider non-contrast CT later in the day if able to tolerate,
   but suspect that she will not be able to
   - no more lasix for now
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 5 of 7 day
   course
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr 3.4 this AM after mild diuresis
   this AM, recent baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year. Possibly new
   baseline vs acute pre-renal etiology.  FENa yesterday was 1.2%
   (equivocal)
   - No diuresis today
   - aim to reach goal with POs alone, supplement if needed
   - restarting NaHCO3 for chronic renal acidosis, HCO3s hovering around
   21 recently
   - will discuss possibility of short term HD with family today
   - touch base with renal re: increasing sevalamer
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Continue Metoprolol
   - Continue current regimen
   # Hyperphospatemia: [**1-13**] ARF
   - touch base with renal re: increasing sevalamer
   - low phosphorous diet
   - pt to f/u with outpatient renal
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.1 from 6.1on admission in setting of acute on
   chronic renal failure.
   - Kayexelate given this AM
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental status
lucid and fully oriented, but endorses hallucinations
   of kids walking around room. Likely from prolonged ICU stay.
   - Continue to monitor mental status
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: seen on echo [**3-2**].  No history of COPD or
   other documented lung disease.
    - Continue on current regimen
    - Will need outpatient pulmonologist
   # CVA/TIA history: has hx of questionable CVA in [**Month (only) 25**], although no
   obvious evidence on imaging per prior notes.
   - PT once able

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt remained delerious through the day, thought to be related to
   trazodone also w/ ICU and ? uremia contributing. Dr. [**Name (NI) 1788**], Pt's
   outpatient nephrologist was consulted. Although initially renal fellow
   thought she was likely hypovolemic, he thought Pt was likely volume
   overloaded. He suggested holding amlodipine (which was d/c) to increase
   MAP and see if that improves UOP. He also suggested that we initiate
   discussions with the family and Pt about short-term hemodialysis.
   Although there is not currently a need for HD, if the Pt remains
   oliguric she may ultimately benefit from short term HD, if this is
   within goals of care for the family.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure with recent history of nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic.
   PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening CHF but CXR concerning for RLL
   pneumonia. No leukocytosis at first but now borderline. No fever or
   chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural effusion
   concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of fluid
   overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided effusion,
   but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. Has
   decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.  Pt. had acute hypoxia in the morning of [**3-4**]
   treated with lasix with some improvement but deteriorating renal
   function.
   - Will consider non-contrast CT later in the day if able to tolerate,
   but suspect that she will not be able to

   - Continue ciprofloxacin for double GN coverage for HAP
   # Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Cr 3.4 this AM after mild diuresis
   this AM, recent baseline in the mid 2s earlier this year. Possibly new
   baseline vs acute pre-renal etiology.  FENa yesterday was 1.2%
   (equivocal)
   - No diuresis today
   - aim to reach goal with POs alone, supplement if needed
   - restarting NaHCO3 for chronic renal acidosis, HCO3s hovering around
   21 recently
   - will discuss possibility of short term HD with family today
   - touch base with renal re: increasing sevalamer
   # HTN: Unclear baseline BP but last progress note says BP 130/70.
   Hypertensive on admission, possibly contributing to edema leading to
   worsening SOB.  Started on nitro gtt in the ED, weaned off overnight.
   On atenolol and amlodipine at home for BP control. Restarted amlodipine
   - Continue Metoprolol
   - Continue current regimen
   # Hyperphospatemia: [**1-13**] ARF
   - touch base with renal re: increasing sevalamer
   - low phosphorous diet
   - pt to f/u with outpatient renal
   # Hyperkalemia: K+ at 5.1 from 6.1on admission in setting of acute on
   chronic renal failure.
   - Kayexelate given this AM

   # Mental status
lucid and fully oriented, but endorses hallucinations
   of kids walking around room. Likely from prolonged ICU stay.
   - Continue to monitor mental status
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: seen on echo [**3-2**].  No history of COPD or
   other documented lung disease.
    - Continue on current regimen

Summary:

The patient, a 90-year-old female, has been admitted to the ICU with worsening shortness of breath, pneumonia, and acute on chronic renal failure. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. She has been treated with antibiotics, diuretics, and vasodilators, but her condition has continued to deteriorate. Her vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.4°C, heart rate 118 bpm, blood pressure 134/53 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 93%. She has a severe first-degree atrioventricular block and is receiving prophylactic heparin.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening hypoxic respiratory distress and pneumonia increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's severe first-degree atrioventricular block and pulmonary artery hypertension increase the risk of cardiac failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure and hyperkalemia increase the risk of further renal failure.
4. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient's hyperphosphatemia may worsen her renal function and increase the risk of cardiac complications.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen and spread to other areas of her lungs, increasing the risk of respiratory failure.
6. Parapneumonic effusion: The patient's parapneumonic effusion may worsen and require drainage, increasing the risk of complications.
7. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension may worsen and increase the risk of cardiac failure.
8. CVA/TIA: The patient's history of questionable CVA and TIA increases the risk of further neurological complications.
9. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory status closely.
2. Consider non-contrast CT scan to rule out other etiologies for her respiratory failure.
3. Continue to treat the patient's pneumonia with antibiotics and consider adding a bronchodilator.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider adding a diuretic if necessary.
5. Consider adding a phosphate binder to the patient's regimen to help manage her hyperphosphatemia.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and consider adding a sedative if necessary.
7. Consider adding a pulmonary specialist to the patient's care team to help manage her pulmonary hypertension.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's CVA/TIA history and consider adding a neurologist to the patient's care team if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt remained delerious through the day, thought to be related to
   trazodone also w/ ICU and ? uremia contributing. Dr. [**Name (NI) 1788**], Pt's
   outpatient nephrologist was consulted. Although initially renal fellow
   thought she was likely hypovolemic, he thought Pt was likely volume
   overloaded. He suggested holding amlodipine (which was d/c) to increase
   MAP and see if that improves UOP. He also suggested that we initiate
   discussions with the family and Pt about short-term hemodialysis.
   Although there is not currently a need for HD, if the Pt remains
   oliguric she may ultimately benefit from short term HD, if this is
   within goals of care for the family.

   concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of fluid
   overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided effusion,
   but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. Has
   decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted with worsening shortness of breath, pneumonia, and effusion. She has developed acute on chronic renal failure, hyperkalemia, and hyperphosphatemia. Her mental status is lucid and fully oriented, but she endorses hallucinations. She has severe TR and pulmonary artery hypertension on echo. The patient's condition has been stabilized, but she remains oliguric and requires further management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's worsening hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia increase the risk of ARDS.
2. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and effusion increase the risk of sepsis, especially with the presence of hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's severe TR and pulmonary artery hypertension increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure increases the risk of further deterioration of renal function, leading to chronic kidney disease.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia increase the risk of electrolyte imbalance, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
6. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's recent hospitalization and immobilization increase the risk of pulmonary embolism, especially with the presence of hypercoagulability.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and use of antibiotics increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as Clostridioides difficile infection.
8. Cognitive Decline: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and use of sedatives increase the risk of cognitive decline and delirium.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider intubation if necessary.
2. Administer antibiotics and antifungals as prescribed.
3. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment as necessary.
4. Continue to manage the patient's pain and discomfort.
5. Consider non-contrast CT scan if the patient is able to tolerate it.
6. Discuss the possibility of short-term hemodialysis with the patient and her family.
7. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider sedation as necessary.
8. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist and nephrologist to optimize the patient's care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt remained delerious through the day, thought to be related to
   trazodone also w/ ICU and ? uremia contributing. Dr. [**Name (NI) 1788**], Pt's
   outpatient nephrologist was consulted. Although initially renal fellow
   thought she was likely hypovolemic, he thought Pt was likely volume
   overloaded. He suggested holding amlodipine (which was d/c) to increase
   MAP and see if that improves UOP. He also suggested that we initiate
   discussions with the family and Pt about short-term hemodialysis.
   Although there is not currently a need for HD, if the Pt remains
   oliguric she may ultimately benefit from short term HD, if this is
   within goals of care for the family.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old individual who has been admitted to the ICU for pneumonia, acute renal failure, hypertension, and chronic pain. They are currently receiving treatment for their conditions, including antibiotics, antihypertensives, and pain management medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 118 beats per minute, blood pressure of 134/53 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 93%. They are receiving mechanical ventilation and have a nasogastric tube in place.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and lactate, indicating acute kidney injury. Their white blood cell count is slightly elevated, and their platelet count is within normal limits. Their troponin level is slightly elevated, indicating possible cardiac injury.

The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension, chronic pain, and a history of kidney disease. They have a history of allergic reactions to iodine, lipitor, and trazodone.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) may progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not managed appropriately.
2. The patient's hypertension may exacerbate their kidney injury and increase their risk of cardiovascular events.
3. The patient's chronic pain may require ongoing management to prevent exacerbation and improve quality of life.
4. The patient's history of kidney disease may increase their risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) if not managed appropriately.
5. The patient's troponin level may indicate cardiac injury, which may require further evaluation and management.
6. The patient's elevated lactate level may indicate metabolic acidosis, which may require treatment to prevent complications.
7. The patient's electrolyte imbalance may require treatment to prevent complications such as arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
8. The patient's history of allergic reactions may increase their risk of adverse reactions to medications and other substances.
9. The patient's chronic kidney disease may increase their risk of developing anemia, which may require treatment.
10. The patient's history of chronic pain may increase their risk of developing depression and anxiety, which may require treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: new worsening hypoxic respiratory
   failure with recent history of nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic.
   PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening CHF but CXR concerning for RLL
   pneumonia. No leukocytosis at first but now borderline. No fever or
   chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural effusion
   concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of fluid
   overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided effusion,
   but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. Has
   decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.  Pt. had acute hypoxia in the morning of [**3-4**]
   treated with lasix with some improvement but deteriorating renal
   function.
   - Will consider non-contrast CT later in the day if able to tolerate,
   but suspect that she will not be able to
   - no more lasix for now
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - treat for HAP with vanc to level and cefepime, today = day 5 of 7 day

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt remained delerious through the day, thought to be related to
   trazodone also w/ ICU and ? uremia contributing. Dr. [**Name (NI) 1788**], Pt's
   outpatient nephrologist was consulted. Although initially renal fellow
   thought she was likely hypovolemic, he thought Pt was likely volume
   overloaded. He suggested holding amlodipine (which was d/c) to increase
   MAP and see if that improves UOP. He also suggested that we initiate
   discussions with the family and Pt about short-term hemodialysis.
   Although there is not currently a need for HD, if the Pt remains
   oliguric she may ultimately benefit from short term HD, if this is
   within goals of care for the family.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 211**] y/o F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and
   chronic kidney disease presents with worsening SOB starting last night
   and continuing until morning. CXR with evidence of pneumonia and
   effusion.  Also with worsening renal failure and hyperkalemia.

   failure with recent history of nighttime SOB that seems to be chronic.
   PNA vs Orthopnea [**1-13**] worsening CHF but CXR concerning for RLL
   pneumonia. No leukocytosis at first but now borderline. No fever or
   chills.  No h/o CAD or CHF, but has likely R sided pleural effusion
   concerning for parapneumonic effusion, and some evidence of fluid
   overload on CXR.   Bedside ultrasound on [**3-3**] shows a R sided effusion,
   but not large enough to tap without danger of lung injury. Has
   decreased breath sounds on the R, but few crackles. New echo with
   severe TR and pulm artery HTN. Other etiology on the differential could
   be PE as she was hospitalized recently, but no leg swelling and has
   been ambulating at home.  Pt. had acute hypoxia in the morning of [**3-4**]

   function.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent possible CVA, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted with worsening SOB, pneumonia, and effusion. She has developed acute hypoxia, worsening renal failure, and hyperkalemia. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, diuretics, and electrolyte supplementation. She has been weaned off oxygen therapy and is currently on a regimen of IV antibiotics, diuretics, and electrolyte supplementation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia pose a significant risk of respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's worsening renal function and hyperkalemia indicate a high risk of AKI, which may require hemodialysis.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia require close monitoring and management to prevent life-threatening arrhythmias and other complications.
4. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's severe pulmonary hypertension may require further evaluation and management to prevent right heart failure.
5. Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA): The patient's history of possible CVA and recent hypoxic events pose a risk of further CVA or stroke.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and underlying medical conditions increase the risk of DVT, which may require prophylactic anticoagulation.
7. Stress Ulcer: The patient's critical illness and underlying medical conditions increase the risk of stress ulcer, which may require prophylactic treatment.
8. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of VAP, which may require further antibiotic therapy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IV antibiotics and diuretics as prescribed.
2. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely and adjust therapy as needed.
3. Consider non-contrast CT scan to evaluate for pulmonary embolism.
4. Wean the patient off oxygen therapy as tolerated.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider mechanical ventilation if necessary.
6. Consider hemodialysis if the patient's renal function continues to deteriorate.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider further evaluation and management of pulmonary hypertension.
8. Consider prophylactic anticoagulation to prevent DVT.
9. Monitor the patient's stress ulcer risk and consider prophylactic treatment as needed.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider further antibiotic therapy for VAP if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including COPD, admitted to the ICU with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hypoxemia, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (97°F)
* Heart rate: 69 bpm (normal range: 61-118 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 164/64 mmHg (normal range: 97-139/35-99 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (normal range: 14-28 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 97% (normal range: 95-100%)

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* No acute distress
* Normocephalic
* Normal heart sounds
* Rhonchorous breath sounds in both lungs
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* Right and left lower extremity edema (1+)
* Warm skin
* Confused, but attentive and follows simple commands
* Oriented to year and president, but not to place
* No pain

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.1 g/dL (normal range: 13-17 g/dL)
* White blood cell count: 5.3-11.5 K/uL (normal range: 4-11 K/uL)
* Platelet count: 55-178 K/uL (normal range: 150-450 K/uL)
* Creatinine: 3.2-3.7 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.2 mg/dL)
* Trop T: 0.08 ng/mL (normal range: 0-0.4 ng/mL)
* Glucose: 89-144 mg/dL (normal range: 70-110 mg/dL)

The patient's condition is complex, and potential medical complications include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia, which may lead to further respiratory complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or respiratory failure.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating worsening kidney function. This may lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is 97%, indicating some degree of hypoxemia. This may lead to further respiratory complications, such as ARDS or respiratory failure.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, indicating hyperkalemia. This may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory depression.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid status is tenuous, and the patient may be at risk for fluid overload, which may exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular complications.
6. Deteriorating renal function: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, indicating worsening kidney function. This may lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue antibiotics for pneumonia.
2. Manage hypoxemia with oxygen therapy.
3. Plan for temporary hemodialysis (HD) line and HD today.
4. Monitor and manage fluid status closely to avoid fluid overload.
5. Monitor and manage electrolyte imbalances, particularly potassium and creatinine levels.
6. Consider further diagnostic testing, such as echocardiogram or cardiac biomarkers, to evaluate cardiac function.
7. Consider consultation with nephrology and cardiology services to further manage the patient's complex medical condition."
