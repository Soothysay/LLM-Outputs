   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3605**] is a 37M with a PMH s/f severe alcoholism with several ICU
   admissions for management of airway protection/withdrawl in the past,
   HCV, and HBV, found unresponsive in the setting of alcohol
   intoxication, intubated for airway protection, with incidentally
   diagnosed leukocytosis on routine labs.
   #. Altered mental status: DDX includes ETOH intoxication with level of
   280, other toxic ingestion, intracranial bleed from his fall, seizure
   from ETOH withdrawl vs. trauma. Head CT negative for a bleed, CT Cspine
   pending, and no clear toxic-metabolic abnormalities on initial labs.
   He does have a leukocytosis, however, no fevers or hemodynamic
   instability.  On propofol wean the patient is awake, moving all four
   extremities.
   -Send urine tox, serum osms
   -Follow up final read of CT C-spine and CXR
   #. Hypoxia: In the setting of alcohol intoxication, likely secondary to
   an aspiration event.  CXR is clear by my read.
   -Will follow up final read of CXR
   -STAT ABG on arrival to unit, titrate vent settings prn
   -Will keep intubated overnight, with light sedation, SBT with RISBE in
   AM, plan to extubate early
   #. ETOH intoxication: Patient has a history of withdrawl seizures.
   Also has severe anxiety at baseline, and is difficult to monitor with a
   CIWA scale, as his subjective symptoms have been unreliable
   -Will use vital signs (hyperthermia, HTN, Tachycardia)to monitor ETOH
   withdrawl, and sedate with propofol drip while intubated.
   -Can use diazapam 10mg IV prn ETOH withdrawl once extubated
   -MVI, thiamine, folic acid
   #. Leukocytosis: no current fevers, or signs of sepsis.  CXR and UA
   clear.
   -Will send urine, blood, and sputum cultures if he spikes.
   #. HCV/HBV: previous hx transaminitis, at baseline
   #. Depression/anxiety: No current treatment for this.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of severe alcoholism, HCV, and HBV, who was found unresponsive in the setting of alcohol intoxication and intubated for airway protection. He has been admitted to the ICU for management of his airway and potential complications related to his intoxication.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.9°F)
* Heart rate: 98 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 113/70 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Spontaneous ventilation: 389 mL

He is receiving invasive ventilation, and his ventilator settings are:

* Ventilator mode: CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow
* Vt (set): 550 mL
* Vt (spontaneous): 389 mL
* RR (set): 14
* PEEP: 5 cmH2O
* FiO2: 30%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Leukocytosis: 8.9 K/uL
* Hct: 30.6%
* Plt: 246
* Cr: 0.8 mg/dL
* TCO2: 28 mmol/L
* Glucose: 84 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 13.0/28.5/1.1, ALT/AST: 99/96, Alk Phos/T Bili: 74/0.4, Differential-Neuts: 75.8%, Lymph: 14.5%, Mono: 5.0%, Eos: 4.2%, Lactic Acid: 1.7 mmol/L, LDH: 213 IU/L, Ca++: 8.2 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.6 mg/dL, PO4: 3.1 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is likely due to ETOH intoxication, but other causes such as toxic ingestion, intracranial bleed, or seizure from ETOH withdrawal or trauma cannot be ruled out. A head CT was negative for bleed, and CT C-spine is pending.
* Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely secondary to an aspiration event, and he will require close monitoring and ventilator adjustments.
* ETOH intoxication: The patient has a history of withdrawal seizures and severe anxiety, and will require close monitoring and sedation with propofol drip while intubated.
* Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is not currently accompanied by fever or signs of sepsis, and cultures will be sent if he spikes.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and leukocytosis increase his risk of respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and lack of fever or signs of sepsis make it unclear whether he has an underlying infection.
* Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and history of withdrawal seizures increase his risk of neurological complications.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of severe alcoholism and leukocytosis increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications such as pancreatitis or gastrointestinal bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 37-year-old male with a history of severe alcoholism, was found unresponsive in the setting of alcohol intoxication and was intubated for airway protection. He was diagnosed with leukocytosis on routine labs and has a history of ICU admissions for airway protection and withdrawal.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T: 37.7°C, HR: 98 bpm, BP: 113/70 mmHg, RR: 14 breaths/min, SpO2: 96%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Stable
* Fluid balance: Total fluid input 1,210 mL, total fluid output 510 mL, with a balance of 855 mL
* Respiratory support: Invasive ventilation, PEEP 5 cmH2O, FiO2 30%, Vt 550 mL
* Lab results: WBC 8.9 K/uL, Hct 30.6%, Plt 246 K/uL, Cr 0.8 mg/dL, TCO2 28 mmHg, Glucose 84 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* ETOH withdrawal seizures
* Pancreatitis due to elevated lipase levels and abdominal pain
* Sepsis due to leukocytosis and potential bacterial growth in the respiratory tract
* Respiratory failure due to inadequate ventilation or oxygenation
* Cardiac complications due to hypertension and tachycardia
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulceration
* Renal failure due to inadequate fluid management

The patient's plan includes attempting to extubate, weaning off propofol, and monitoring for ETOH withdrawal symptoms. The patient will also receive IV fluids, antibiotics if sepsis develops, and close monitoring for pancreatitis and other complications."

 .H/O ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3605**] is a 37M with a PMH s/f severe alcoholism with several ICU
   admissions for management of airway protection/withdrawal in the past,
   HCV, and HBV, found unresponsive in the setting of alcohol
   intoxication, intubated for airway protection, with incidentally
   diagnosed leukocytosis on routine labs.
    #. Altered mental status: DDX includes ETOH intoxication with level of
   280, other toxic ingestion, intracranial bleed from his fall, seizure
   from ETOH withdrawl vs. trauma. Head CT negative for a bleed, CT Cspine
   pending, and no clear toxic-metabolic abnormalities on initial labs.
   He does have a leukocytosis, however, no fevers or hemodynamic
   instability.  On propofol wean the patient is awake, moving all four
   extremities.  CT C-spine negative for fracture.
   - will attempt to extubate
   #. ETOH intoxication: Patient has a history of withdrawl seizures.
   Also has severe anxiety at baseline, and is difficult to monitor with a
   CIWA scale, as his subjective symptoms have been unreliable
   -Will use vital signs (hyperthermia, HTN, Tachycardia)to monitor ETOH
   withdrawl
   -Can use diazapam 10mg IV prn ETOH withdrawl after extubated
   -MVI, thiamine, folic acid
   #. Leukocytosis: no current fevers, or signs of sepsis.  CXR and UA
   clear.
   -Will send urine, blood, and sputum cultures if he spikes.
   # Pancreatitis:  lipase elevated and has abdominal pain on exam.  Will
   continue to follow closely, administer IVF, consider NPO status if
   abdominal pain does not improve after extubation.
   #. HCV/HBV: previous hx transaminitis, at baseline
   #. Depression/anxiety: No current treatment for this.

Summary:

The patient, a 37-year-old male with a history of severe alcoholism, was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and altered mental status. He was intubated for airway protection and diagnosed with leukocytosis. After extubation, he was given diazepam for objective criteria of withdrawal (tachycardia and diaphoresis). The patient has a history of withdrawal seizures and severe anxiety. His vital signs are being monitored to track his ethanol withdrawal symptoms. He is also being treated for pancreatitis, with lipase levels elevated and abdominal pain present on exam.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ethanol Withdrawal Syndrome: The patient has a history of withdrawal seizures and severe anxiety, which can lead to complications such as seizures, hallucinations, and increased anxiety.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for respiratory failure, and extubation may be challenging due to his respiratory status.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated lipase levels and abdominal pain, which can lead to complications such as sepsis, organ failure, and death if not managed promptly.
4. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis, but no current fevers or signs of sepsis. However, if he spikes a fever or develops other signs of sepsis, it can lead to organ failure and death.
5. Delirium Tremens: The patient has a history of delirium tremens and may experience hallucinations, agitation, and confusion during ethanol withdrawal.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of HCV and HBV, which can increase his risk of infection and sepsis.
7. Depression and Anxiety: The patient has a history of depression and anxiety, which can worsen during ethanol withdrawal and lead to complications such as suicidal ideation and increased anxiety.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, and laboratory results to prevent and manage these potential complications."

 .H/O ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3605**] is a 37M with a PMH s/f severe alcoholism with several ICU
   admissions for management of airway protection/withdrawal in the past,
   HCV, and HBV, found unresponsive in the setting of alcohol
   intoxication, intubated for airway protection, with incidentally
   diagnosed leukocytosis on routine labs.
    #. Altered mental status: DDX includes ETOH intoxication with level of
   280, other toxic ingestion, intracranial bleed from his fall, seizure
   from ETOH withdrawl vs. trauma. Head CT negative for a bleed, CT Cspine
   negative for fracture, and no clear toxic-metabolic abnormalities on
   initial labs.  He does have a leukocytosis, however, no fevers or
   hemodynamic instability.  Since extubation yesterday, he seems to have
   come back to baseline MS.
   #. ETOH intoxication: Patient has a history of withdrawl seizures.
   Also has severe anxiety at baseline, and is difficult to monitor with a
   CIWA scale, as his subjective symptoms have been unreliable. Here, he
   currently has no objective signs of withdrawl- no HTN, tachycardia,
   hyperthermia. Got 30 Valium in last 24 hrs. Will monitor for signs/
   symptoms of withdrawl but currently roughly 48 hrs since last use and
   not showing any signs of withdrawl
   -MVI, thiamine, folic acid PO
   #. Leukocytosis: no current fevers, or signs of sepsis.  CXR and UA
   clear.  Has since resolved.
   -Will send urine, blood, and sputum cultures if he spikes.
   # Pancreatitis:  lipase elevated and had abdominal pain on exam
   originally but has since resolved. Will continue to monitor.
   #. HCV/HBV: previous hx transaminitis, at baseline
   #. Depression/anxiety: No current treatment for this.
   - SW consulted- may try to Section 35 if pt still here on Mon.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 37-year-old male, is a known case of severe alcoholism with multiple ICU admissions for airway protection and withdrawal management. He was found unresponsive due to alcohol intoxication and was intubated for airway protection. 

The patient was extubated without complications and is currently receiving prophylactic antibiotics, anticoagulation, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. He has a history of withdrawal seizures and severe anxiety, which makes it difficult to monitor for signs of withdrawal using the CIWA scale. 

The patient has a leukocytosis, but it has since resolved, and there are no current signs of sepsis. He also has a history of pancreatitis, but the abdominal pain has since resolved. 

The patient's mental status has improved since extubation, and he is currently alert and able to follow simple commands. He has a history of depression and anxiety, but there is no current treatment for this. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) puts him at risk for further respiratory complications.
2. Withdrawal seizures: The patient's history of withdrawal seizures and severe anxiety makes it crucial to closely monitor for signs of withdrawal.
3. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and history of pancreatitis put him at risk for developing sepsis.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient's history of pancreatitis and elevated lipase levels put him at risk for further complications.
5. Hepatitis C and B: The patient's history of HCV and HBV infections puts him at risk for further liver damage and complications.
6. Depression and anxiety: The patient's history of depression and anxiety makes it crucial to closely monitor his mental status and provide appropriate treatment.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, and mental status to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, successfully extubated, and receiving prophylactic heparin for DVT prevention. The patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal, including delirium tremens, seizures, and is currently receiving valium for symptoms. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, and blood pressure of 120/74 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is improving, with a SpO2 of 97% and ABG results of ///25/. The patient's lab results show normal ranges for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, with elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase and liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying condition.
2. Delirium: The patient's history of delirium tremens and current symptoms of mild agitation suggest a risk of further delirium.
3. Seizures: The patient's history of seizures and current symptoms of mild agitation suggest a risk of further seizures.
4. DVT: The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin for DVT prevention, but there is still a risk of DVT due to the patient's immobility.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated lactate dehydrogenase and liver enzymes suggest a risk of infection.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's history of alcohol withdrawal and current symptoms of mild agitation suggest a risk of nutritional deficiencies.
7. Medication side effects: The patient is receiving valium for symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, but there is still a risk of medication side effects.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Continue to manage the patient's delirium and agitation with valium and other medications as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of DVT and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's lab results and adjust treatment accordingly.
5. Consider nutritional supplements to prevent nutritional deficiencies.
6. Monitor the patient for signs of infection and adjust treatment accordingly.
7. Monitor the patient for signs of medication side effects and adjust treatment accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He was successfully extubated and is currently on a PO diet. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 120/74 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 97% and he is on standby ventilation.

The patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal, including delirium tremens, seizures, and respiratory failure. He has been receiving Valium 10mg x3 overnight and is currently not in overt withdrawal. He is also receiving MIVU folate thiamine.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.9, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 246. His liver function tests are within normal limits, with an ALT of 99 IU/L and AST of 96 IU/L.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Respiratory failure: the patient is doing well from a respiratory standpoint after being successfully extubated.
2. ETOH withdrawal: the patient is receiving Valium 10mg x3 overnight and is currently not in overt withdrawal. He will continue to receive CIWA and will be okay for transfer to the floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: the patient's respiratory failure could worsen if he is not closely monitored and managed.
2. ETOH withdrawal: the patient could experience a relapse of his withdrawal symptoms if he is not properly managed.
3. Delirium: the patient's delirium could worsen if he is not closely monitored and managed.
4. Seizures: the patient could experience a seizure if his ETOH withdrawal is not properly managed.
5. Infection: the patient could develop an infection if his immune system is compromised.
6. Cardiovascular complications: the patient could experience cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest if his blood pressure is not properly managed.
7. Neurological complications: the patient could experience neurological complications such as stroke or cerebral edema if his blood pressure is not properly managed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status and manage his respiratory failure accordingly.
2. Continue to manage the patient's ETOH withdrawal symptoms and monitor him for signs of relapse.
3. Monitor the patient's delirium and manage it accordingly.
4. Monitor the patient's seizure risk and manage it accordingly.
5. Monitor the patient's infection risk and manage it accordingly.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and manage it accordingly.
7. Monitor the patient's neurological status and manage it accordingly."
