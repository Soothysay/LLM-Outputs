   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   1.       Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure with known
   severe oxygen dependent COPD.  Over the course of this morning she has
   deteriorated initially from a primary hypoxemia
 likely due to RLL
   collapse and volume overload- then evolved into hypercarbia. Her ABG
   showed an uncompensated resp academia and she was beginning to become
   somnolent. We elected to intubate felling she did have the mental
   status to even trial BIPAP.
   Vent: start with AC low tidal volumes and see if she can covert to PSV
   quickly this AM
   HAP: Vanco/Meropenem- send sputum cultures
   COPD: increase to [**Hospital1 **] Medrol, ATC MDIs
   Volume Overload: goal 500 to 1000cc negative as BP tolerate
   Place Aline for hemodynamics and freq ABGs
   2.  GIB:  Persistent dark guaiac positive stools.  Hct 24.0.  No
   documentation of NGT lavage.  Hemodynamically stable here.  Guaiac
   stools, serial CBC's, IV PPI, active type and screen, will transfuse
   one unit this AM for Hct < 25.
   Per DR [**First Name (STitle) 7116**] who was called from OSH- she had an EGD there which was neg
   and she had a C scope last year which was clean. OSH GI attg feels that
   IR would be next step so if she dose re bleed we will discuss with IR
   bleeding scan versus Angio looking for lower source.
   3. Acute renal failure in setting of hypotension, most likely ATN as
   felt by outside MD's.  Resolving with improved urine output and Cr.
   Monitor I/Os with foley, daily Cr.
   4.  Afib: Rate better controlled after metoprolol.  Restart metoprolol,
   diltiazem.  Hold on anticoagulation for now in setting of GIB.
   5.  Thrombocytopenia:  Felt to be secondary to zosyn at OSH, counts
   have improved after stopping this med.  Not clear if she had heparin,
   or antibodies checked.  Will hold on heparin products here for now and
   check for antibodies.  Follow counts.
   6.       CAD:  Has had chest tightness albeit notes this has been
   present since extubation.  No acute changes on ECG except flattened
   twaves in setting of RVR.  Will trend enzymes.  Cntinue simvastatin,
   beta blocker as above. Not on outpt ASA and has GI bleed but if acute
   ischemia OK for ASA>
   7.       Back Wound: Burn from OSH heating pad, silvadine,   wound care
   consult  in AM.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old woman with COPD, pHTN, Afib, and a GI bleed. She has been admitted to the ICU with severe respiratory distress and has required intubation. Her condition has deteriorated over the course of the morning, with worsening hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and somnolence. She has also developed acute renal failure, likely due to hypotension, and has a platelet count of 86 K/uL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, with severe hypoxemia and hypercarbia. She requires intubation and mechanical ventilation to support her respiratory function.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and has been taking beta blockers and simvastatin. She has also developed Afib, which may be contributing to her tachycardia and cardiac instability.
3. GI bleeding: The patient has a persistent GI bleed, which may be due to a variety of factors, including peptic ulcer disease, gastrointestinal vasculitis, or bleeding from a duodenal ulcer.
4. Renal failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, which may be due to hypotension, sepsis, or other factors. Her creatinine level is elevated, and she requires close monitoring of her renal function.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a platelet count of 86 K/uL, which is low. This may be due to a variety of factors, including zosyn, heparin, or other medications.
6. Wound infection: The patient has a burn wound on her back, which may be at risk for infection. She requires close monitoring of her wound and may require wound care consults.
7. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to her respiratory and GI bleeding. She requires close monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory values to detect any signs of sepsis early.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation to support the patient's respiratory function.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, including her heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac enzymes.
3. Manage the patient's GI bleeding with IV PPI and serial CBCs. Consider endoscopy or other diagnostic tests to determine the source of the bleeding.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely, including her urine output and creatinine level. Consider dialysis if her renal function continues to deteriorate.
5. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusions if her platelet count continues to decline.
6. Provide wound care and monitor the patient's wound for signs of infection.
7. Consider sepsis protocols to detect early signs of sepsis and treat promptly if sepsis develops."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old woman with a history of COPD, pHTN, Afib, and GI bleed, who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and gastrointestinal bleeding. She has been treated with various medications, including metoprolol, pantoprazole, and furosemide. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 140/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has been intubated.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure with known severe oxygen-dependent COPD. She has deteriorated from primary hypoxemia likely due to RLL collapse and volume overload, then evolved into hypercarbia. The plan is to start ventilation with AC low tidal volumes and see if she can convert to PSV quickly.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Persistent dark guaiac-positive stools, Hct 24.0. No documentation of NGT lavage. She is hemodynamically stable, but guaiac stools, serial CBCs, IV PPI, and active type and screen are planned. GI consultation is also planned.
3. Acute renal failure: Most likely ATN as felt by outside MDs. Resolving with improved urine output and Cr. Monitor I/Os with foley, daily Cr.
4. Atrial fibrillation: Rate better controlled after metoprolol. Restart metoprolol and diltiazem. Hold on anticoagulation in setting of GIB.
5. Thrombocytopenia: Felt to be secondary to zosyn at OSH, counts have improved after stopping this med. Not clear if she had heparin or antibodies checked. Will hold on heparin products here for now and check for antibodies. Follow counts.
6. CAD: Has had chest tightness, albeit present since extubation. No acute changes on ECG except flattened twaves in setting of RVR. Will trend enzymes. Continue simvastatin, beta blocker as above. Not on outpatient ASA and has GI bleed.
7. Back wound: Burn from OSH heating pad, silvadine, wound care consult.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may develop further respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is ongoing, and she may require further intervention to control the bleeding.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not adequately managed, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to further cardiac complications if not adequately managed.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen if not adequately managed, leading to further bleeding complications.
6. CAD: The patient's CAD may worsen if not adequately managed, leading to further cardiac complications.
7. Back wound: The patient's back wound may become infected or develop further complications if not adequately managed."

   Impression: 82 year old female with a history of coronary artery
   disease s/p CABG, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation and
   COPD on home oxygen who presented to OSH on [**2154-11-4**] with hypotension,
   bradycardia and hypercarbic respiratory failure now transferred for
   management of gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  No extubated since [**2154-11-5**] and doing
   well.  ABG shows chronic respiratory acidosis which is well
   compensated.  Poor air movement on exam.  On 3L nasal cannula at home,
   currently satting 95% on 4L.  CXR with evidence of volume overload.
   - transition to prednisone 60 mg daily
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   - titrate oxygen for saturations > 90%
   - completed 5 day course of azithromycin
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.0.  Currently 1.5 down from

   urine ouput.
   - will continue to monitor
   - renally dose medications
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Patient has been having dark guaiac
   positive stools since admission to [**Location (un) **].  Her hematocrit on
   admission was 19.4 and per reports she received 2 units of packed red
   blood cells. Her hematocrit is currently 26.0.  She does continue to
   note some subjective chest pressure but says that her breathing is
   currently close to her baseline.
   - active type and screen
   - triple lumen for access, will need to establish peripheral access
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]

   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count increasing from nadir of 56.
   - send PF4 antibiodies
   - holding heparin products
   - monitor platelet count
   Atrial Fibrillation:  In rapid ventricular response on admission, now
   improved with IV metoprolol.  Off digoxin and tykosyn since admission
   to outside hospital.
   - restart metoprolol at 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - titrate up diltiazem as tolerated
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding
   - holding tykosin and digoxin, will discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6636**]
   Coronary Artery Disease s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   Currently complaining of chest tightness in the setting of rapid
   ventricular rates. Troponins slightly elevated at 0.2.  Trend not
   available from [**Location (un) **]. EKG without ischemic changes.
   - continue simvastatin

   sided effusion s/p thoracentesis with transudate.
   - will give lasix 40 mg IV x 1 now
   - goal I/O - 500 to 1 L
   - control blood pressures as tolerated
   - continue beta blocker and calcium channel blocker for atrial
   fibrillation
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **].
   - Silvadene 1% cream to coccyx [**Hospital1 **]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a complex medical condition. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, gastrointestinal bleeding, respiratory failure, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is receiving various medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, metoprolol, pantoprazole, and furosemide. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, and blood pressure of 113/38 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is supported by a ventilator, with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and FiO2 of 60%.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of kidney dysfunction, with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen level of 36 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests are normal, with a total bilirubin level of 0.3 mg/dL and an albumin level of 3.5 g/dL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening of kidney function: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate worsening kidney function. Close monitoring of the patient's renal function and consideration of nephrotoxic medications should be done.
2. Development of sepsis: The patient's respiratory failure and gastrointestinal bleeding increase the risk of developing sepsis. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and laboratory results, as well as prompt treatment of any suspected infections, is essential.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and impaired skin integrity increase the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring of the patient's bleeding status and prompt treatment of any bleeding episodes are necessary.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure increases the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and prompt treatment of any respiratory complications are necessary.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure. Close monitoring of the patient's cardiac status and prompt treatment of any cardiac complications are necessary.

In summary, the patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical condition, requiring close monitoring and prompt treatment of potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD, who presented to the hospital with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was transferred to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* Heart rate: 74 bpm (normal range: 71-136 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 113/38 mmHg (normal range: 95-135/60-110 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 13 inspirations per minute (normal range: 11-26 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 95% (normal range: 95-100%)
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.1-11.9 x 10^9/L (normal range: 4-11 x 10^9/L)
* Hemoglobin: 7.9-8.6 g/dL (normal range: 12-16 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 86-104 x 10^9/L (normal range: 150-450 x 10^9/L)
* Creatinine: 1.5-1.8 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.2 mg/dL)
* TropT: 0.21-0.27 ng/mL (normal range: <0.1 ng/mL)
* Troponin-T: 0.27 ng/mL (normal range: <0.1 ng/mL)

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Respiratory failure
* Atrial fibrillation
* Impaired skin integrity
* Acute renal failure
* Coronary artery disease
* Aortic valve replacement
* Hypertension
* Hyperlipidemia
* Diastolic congestive heart failure
* Back wound

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* IV fluids to manage hypotension
* Oxygen therapy to maintain oxygen saturation > 90%
* Anticoagulation therapy to prevent deep vein thrombosis
* Wound care and dressing changes for the back wound
* Medications to manage atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia
* Cardiovascular consultation to evaluate the patient's cardiac condition

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Bleeding complications due to gastrointestinal bleeding
* Respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to atrial fibrillation
* Renal failure due to inadequate perfusion
* Infection due to impaired skin integrity
* Wound complications due to back wound
* Cardiovascular complications due to coronary artery disease and aortic valve replacement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD who presented to the hospital with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was reintubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of pulmonary edema and suspected aspiration.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is 71 beats per minute, which is within the normal range.
* Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's ABG shows chronic respiratory acidosis, which is well-compensated. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine was 1.0, and it has increased to 1.5. She is currently making good urine output, and her hematocrit has increased from 19.4 to 27.2.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has been experiencing dark guaiac-positive stools since admission, and her hematocrit has increased from 19.4 to 27.2. She is currently receiving IV PPI and will need to establish peripheral access.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is increasing from a nadir of 56, and she is no longer bleeding actively.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient's rapid ventricular response has improved with IV metoprolol, and she is currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory acidosis and hypercarbic respiratory failure can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can worsen if not managed properly, leading to electrolyte imbalances and other complications.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding can lead to hypovolemic shock and other complications if not managed properly.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can lead to bleeding complications if not managed properly.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can lead to stroke and other cardiovascular complications if not managed properly.

The patient's current medications include:

* Solumedrol 40mg IV [**Hospital1 **]
* Vancomycin 1g IV [**Last Name (un) **]
* Metoprolol 12.5mg IV [**Hospital1 **]
* Simvastatin 40mg PO [**Hospital1 **]
* Lasix 40mg IV [**Hospital1 **]
* Pantoprazole 40mg IV [**Hospital1 **]
* Furosemide 40mg IV [**Hospital1 **]
* Midazolam 1mg/hour IV [**Hospital1 **]
* Ipratropium 20mcg IV [**Hospital1 **]
* Advair 250/50mcg PO [**Hospital1 **]
* Xopenex 2.5mg IV [**Hospital1 **]
* Azithromycin 500mg PO [**Hospital1 **]

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Continue solumedrol 40mg IV [**Hospital1 **] and consider transition to prednisone tomorrow
* Continue vancomycin 1g IV [**Last Name (un) **] for empiric coverage of nosocomial pneumonia
* Continue advair 250/50mcg PO [**Hospital1 **], ipratropium 20mcg IV [**Hospital1 **], and xopenex 2.5mg IV [**Hospital1 **]
* Titrate oxygen for saturations > 90%
* Continue metoprolol 12.5mg IV [**Hospital1 **] and consider titrating up diltiazem as tolerated
* Continue simvastatin 40mg PO [**Hospital1 **]
* Continue lasix 40mg IV [**Hospital1 **] for diastolic congestive heart failure
* Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] for gastrointestinal bleeding

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with bradycardia. They have a history of pulmonary edema, suspected aspiration, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient has received multiple medications, including vancomycin, meropenem, midazolam, and furosemide. They have also received blood transfusions and have had their Foley catheter replaced. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 71 beats per minute, blood pressure of 153/54 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 400-450 mL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of aspiration and pulmonary edema, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and the use of multiple medications increase the risk of developing sepsis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and the use of mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing further respiratory failure.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's bradycardia and history of atrial fibrillation increase the risk of cardiovascular instability.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and the use of anticoagulant medications increase the risk of further bleeding.
6. Renal failure: The patient's history of pulmonary edema and the use of diuretic medications increase the risk of developing renal failure.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and the use of sedative medications increase the risk of developing neurological complications, such as delirium or seizures.
8. Infection: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and the use of invasive lines and catheters increase the risk of developing infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory status closely.
2. Consider obtaining a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia.
3. Consider administering antibiotics to prevent sepsis.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust medications as needed.
5. Consider obtaining a gastrointestinal series to rule out further bleeding.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust diuretic medications as needed.
7. Consider obtaining a neurological consultation to assess the patient's risk of developing neurological complications.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's infection risk and take steps to prevent infection, such as maintaining proper hand hygiene and using antimicrobial-impregnated catheters."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD, who was admitted to the hospital with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was reintubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently being managed in the ICU. The patient has several medical conditions, including acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.0 to 1.5, and she is currently making good urine output. However, the patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.0, and she may still be at risk for further deterioration in her renal function.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has been experiencing dark guaiac positive stools since admission, and her hematocrit has increased from 19.4 to 27.2. She is at risk for further bleeding and may require transfusions.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has increased from 56 to 79, but she is still at risk for bleeding. She may require further transfusions if her platelet count decreases.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently in rapid ventricular response, and her heart rate is irregularly irregular. She may be at risk for further cardiac complications, including cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently elevated, and she is at risk for further cardiac complications if it is not controlled.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is currently taking simvastatin, but her lipid levels are not well controlled. She may be at risk for further cardiac complications if her lipid levels are not managed.
7. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has a volume overload on her CXR, and she may be at risk for further cardiac complications if her heart failure is not managed.
8. Back Wound: The patient has a stage II ulcer on her back, and she may be at risk for further complications, including infection and poor wound healing.

Overall, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including worsening of her acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic congestive heart failure, and back wound complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD who was admitted to the ICU with bradycardia, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and suspected aspiration. The patient was reintubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory acidosis and poor air movement on examination increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine is 1.0, and her current creatinine is 1.5, which may indicate worsening renal function.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has been experiencing dark guaiac-positive stools since admission and has received two units of packed red blood cells.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is increasing, but the etiology of thrombocytopenia is unclear.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's rapid ventricular response has improved with IV metoprolol, but the patient is not anticoagulated due to gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Coronary artery disease: The patient's troponins are slightly elevated, and she is experiencing chest tightness.
7. Diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient has volume overload on CXR with left-sided effusion.
8. Back wound: The patient has a stage II ulcer on her back from a burn injury.

The patient is currently receiving various treatments, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and antacids. The patient's laboratory results show evidence of chronic respiratory acidosis, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's medication list includes simvastatin, metoprolol, and furosemide.

The patient's care plan includes:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and adjust settings as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy accordingly.
3. Continue IV antibiotics and antacids.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medications accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust therapy accordingly.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust therapy accordingly.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust therapy accordingly.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's back wound and adjust therapy accordingly.

The patient's disposition is ICU care for now, and the code status is full code."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD who was admitted to the hospital with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was initially extubated but re-intubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has several ongoing medical conditions, including:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's ABG shows chronic respiratory acidosis, which is well-compensated. She is currently on CPAP/PSV with a FiO2 of 40% and is saturating at 95%.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine was 1.0, and it has increased to 1.5. She is currently making good urine output, and her hematocrit has improved from 19.4 to 27.2.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has been having dark guaiac positive stools since admission and has received 2 units of packed red blood cells. Her hematocrit is currently 27.2.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has increased from a nadir of 56 to 79. The etiology of thrombocytopenia is unclear.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with metoprolol, and she is not anticoagulated due to gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone CABG and aortic valve replacement.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is being controlled with medication.
8. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has volume overload on CXR with a left-sided effusion, which was treated with thoracentesis and transudate.
9. Back Wound: The patient has a stage II ulcer on her back from a burn injury.

The patient is currently being managed with the following medications:

* Solumedrol 40 mg IV
* Vancomycin 1 g IV q12h
* Lasix 40 mg IV
* Pantoprazole 40 mg IV
* Furosemide 40 mg IV
* Midazolam 1 mg/hour IV
* Metoprolol 12.5 mg IV
* Diltiazem 60 mg IV
* Simvastatin 40 mg PO
* Ipratropium 20 mg inhaler
* Home xopenex

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 8.3
* Hct: 23.7, 24.1, 25.5, 27.2
* Plt: 69, 72, 79
* Cr: 1.6, 1.5
* TropT: 0.26
* TCO2: 36, 35
* Glucose: 103, 152, 150, 86
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 13.0/28.1/1.1, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 114/4/0.26, ALT/AST: 6-19, Alk Phos/T Bili: 43/0.3, Differential-Neuts: 90.5%, Band: 0.0%, Lymph: 4.7%, Mono: 4.5%, Eos: 0.2%, Lactic Acid: 0.7 mmol/L, Albumin: 3.5 g/dL, LDH: 284 IU/L, Ca++: 8.5 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL, PO4: 3.5 mg/dL

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may progress to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed properly.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may continue or worsen if not managed properly.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen if not managed properly.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if not managed properly.
6. Coronary artery disease: The patient's coronary artery disease may worsen if not managed properly.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not managed properly.
8. Diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient's diastolic congestive heart failure may worsen if not managed properly.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue solumedrol 40 mg IV and consider transition to prednisone tomorrow.
2. Continue vancomycin 1 g IV q12h for empiric coverage of nosocomial pneumonia.
3. Obtain sputum CXR.
4. Continue advair, ipratropium, and home xopenex.
5. Titrate oxygen for saturations > 90%.
6. Monitor urine output and adjust diuretic therapy as needed.
7. Continue monitoring platelet count and adjust transfusion goal > 25.
8. Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg IV and titrate up diltiazem as tolerated.
9. Continue simvastatin 40 mg PO.
10. Monitor electrolytes and adjust diuretic therapy as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleed, and various comorbidities. Here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Respiratory Status:**

* The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated with a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute.
* The patient has a respiratory support device with a tidal volume of 400-450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
* The patient has a reduced lung compliance (36.4 cmH2O/mL) and a high respiratory system resistance index (RSBI) of 19.

**Gastrointestinal Status:**

* The patient has a gastrointestinal bleed, but the source remains unclear.
* The patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and is being closely monitored.

**Cardiovascular Status:**

* The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and has undergone revascularization.
* The patient is on metoprolol and diltiazem for atrial fibrillation (A-FIB), which has improved in control.

**Hematological Status:**

* The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is attributed to antimicrobial therapy (Zosyn).
* The patient's platelet count is improving.

**Renal Function:**

* The patient has chronic renal insufficiency, which has improved.

**Neurological Status:**

* The patient is awake and oriented, but their neurological status is not fully assessed.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
* Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed may continue to bleed, leading to hypovolemic shock.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count may continue to decrease, leading to bleeding complications.
* Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury.
* Infection: The patient is at risk of developing a hospital-acquired infection, particularly pneumonia.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and A-FIB increases their risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.

**ICU Care:**

* The patient is receiving prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
* The patient's nutrition is being managed through total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
* The patient's glycemic control is being closely monitored.

**Future Management:**

* The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and weaning from mechanical ventilation should be attempted if possible.
* The patient's gastrointestinal bleed should be closely monitored, and endoscopy should be considered if the source of bleeding remains unclear.
* The patient's thrombocytopenia should be closely monitored, and platelet transfusions should be considered if necessary.
* The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and measures should be taken to prevent further deterioration.
* The patient's neurological status should be further assessed, and measures should be taken to prevent further neurological decline."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD, who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was initially extubated, but re-intubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been on non-invasive ventilation and has been reintubated again due to persistent respiratory failure. She has also been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, which has been managed with transfusions and medication.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD, and has undergone aortic valve replacement and CABG. She has also had a recent hospitalization at an outside hospital for hypercarbic respiratory failure and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Current Assessment:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40%. Her ABG shows a pH of 7.31, PCO2 of 69 mmHg, and PO2 of 69 mmHg.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has atrial fibrillation and is on metoprolol. Her blood pressure is 179/74 mmHg, and her heart rate is 78 beats per minute.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, which has been managed with transfusions and medication.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL. She is making good urine output, but will be closely monitored.
* Hematological: The patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 93 K/uL. Her platelet count is increasing, but will be closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue, and may require further interventions such as tracheostomy or lung transplantation.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may continue, and may require further interventions such as endoscopy or surgery.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may continue, and may require further interventions such as dialysis or kidney transplantation.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may continue, and may require further interventions such as platelet transfusions or medication.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may continue, and may require further interventions such as cardioversion or anticoagulation therapy.

Plan:

* Continue mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40%.
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider further interventions such as tracheostomy or lung transplantation.
* Continue to manage the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding with transfusions and medication.
* Monitor the patient's renal status closely and consider further interventions such as dialysis or kidney transplantation.
* Monitor the patient's thrombocytopenia closely and consider further interventions such as platelet transfusions or medication.
* Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with medication and consider further interventions such as cardioversion or anticoagulation therapy.
* Consider further interventions such as echocardiogram or stress test to assess the patient's cardiac function."

   Impression: 82 year old female with a history of coronary artery
   disease s/p CABG, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation and
   COPD on home oxygen who presented to OSH on [**2154-11-4**] with hypotension,
   bradycardia and hypercarbic respiratory failure now transferred for
   management of gastrointestinal bleeding.  Reintubated [**11-10**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of pulmonary edema.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure.  ABG
   shows chronic respiratory acidosis which is well compensated.  Poor air
   movement on exam.  On 3L nasal cannula at home, currently satting 95%
   on 4L.  CXR with evidence of volume overload. RSBI < 50
   - Minimal pressure support and plan to extubate this am
   - Continue solumedrol 40 [**Hospital1 **] and consider transition to prednisone
   tommorow

   - will continue to monitor
   - renally dose medications
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Patient has been having dark guaiac
   positive stools since admission to [**Location (un) **].  No EGD at OSH. Her
   hematocrit on admission was 19.4 and per reports she received 2 units
   of packed red blood cells. Yesterday received 2 U PRBC. Her hematocrit
   is currently 27.2. Currently HD stable.
   - active type and screen
   - triple lumen for access, will need to establish peripheral access
   - transfusion goal > 25

   - f/u GI consult
   - would like to obtain prior records from [**Location (un) **] regarding past
   endoscopies
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count increasing from nadir of 56.
   Negative Pf4 from [**2147**]. Now 79.
   - f/u  PF4 antibiodies
   - holding heparin products
   - monitor platelet count
   - transufse for platelets < 50 while actively bleeding
   Atrial Fibrillation:  In rapid ventricular response on admission, which
   improved with IV metoprolol.  Off digoxin and tykosyn since admission
   to outside hospital.
   - continue metoprolol at 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - titrate up diltiazem as tolerated
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding
   - holding tykosin and digoxin, will discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6636**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD who presented to the hospital with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was reintubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently on non-invasive ventilation. Her condition is complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, and diastolic congestive heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk of further bleeding due to her low platelet count and the presence of dark guaiac-positive stools.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.0 to 1.5, and she is at risk of further deterioration in renal function.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is still decreasing, and she is at risk of further bleeding.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's rapid ventricular response may worsen her cardiac condition, and she is at risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient's volume overload may worsen her cardiac condition, and she is at risk of developing pulmonary edema.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's high cholesterol level may worsen her cardiac condition and increase her risk of cardiac events.
7. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure may worsen her cardiac condition and increase her risk of cardiac events.
8. Back wound: The patient's stage II ulcer on her back may become infected and worsen her overall condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue non-invasive ventilation to manage the patient's respiratory failure.
2. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and platelet count closely.
3. Continue to manage the patient's acute renal failure with close monitoring of her creatinine level and urine output.
4. Monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and adjust her medication regimen as needed.
5. Continue to manage the patient's diastolic congestive heart failure with close monitoring of her cardiac function and volume status.
6. Monitor the patient's hyperlipidemia and adjust her medication regimen as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's hypertension and adjust her medication regimen as needed.
8. Monitor the patient's back wound and adjust her wound care regimen as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory distress/failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- insufficient progress on BiPAP since
   extubation.  Concern for COPD exacerbation, perhaps CHF, on background
   of left hemidiaphragm paresis.  Plan to repeat intubation to protect
   airway and assist ventilation.  Monitor ABG.  F/U CXR.  Would check
   cardiac echo.  Need to consider trach if no obvious rapidly reversible
   etiology determined.
   GI BLEED -- clinically stable.  Monitor Hct serially.
   A-FIB -- recurrent.  Improved control with prn beta-blocker.  Monitor
   HR.  r/o MI protocol.
   HEMATOMA, Groin -- L >> R.  Clinically stable.  Attributed to
   thrombocytopenia, and perhaps instrumentation vs. spontaneous.
   RENAL FAILURE -- suspect related to net diuresis (pre-renal).  Would
   hold on net diuresis, check Cardiac Echo.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- replete free H2O to Na < 147.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- improving.  Attributed to medications.
   DIGOXIN TOXICITY -- resolved.  Monitor level.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory distress/failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- insufficient progress on BiPAP since
   extubation.  Concern for COPD exacerbation, perhaps CHF, on background
   of left hemidiaphragm paresis.  Plan to repeat intubation to protect
   airway and assist ventilation.  Monitor ABG.  F/U CXR.  Would check
   cardiac echo.  Need to consider trach if no obvious rapidly reversible
   etiology determined.
   GI BLEED -- clinically stable.  Monitor Hct serially.
   A-FIB -- recurrent.  Improved control with prn beta-blocker.  Monitor
   HR.  r/o MI protocol.
   HEMATOMA, Groin -- L >> R.  Clinically stable.  Attributed to
   thrombocytopenia, and perhaps instrumentation vs. spontaneous.
   RENAL FAILURE -- suspect related to net diuresis (pre-renal).  Would
   hold on net diuresis, check Cardiac Echo.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- replete free H2O to Na < 147.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- improving.  Attributed to medications.
   DIGOXIN TOXICITY -- resolved.  Monitor level.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with respiratory distress. The patient's condition has been complex and challenging, with multiple medical issues requiring ongoing management.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient remains intubated and on BiPAP due to insufficient progress on non-invasive ventilation since extubation. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation and left hemidiaphragm paresis, which may be contributing to the respiratory distress.
* Cardiac: The patient has atrial fibrillation (A-fib) with rapid ventricular response, which has been improved with prn beta-blocker administration. The patient's cardiac status is being monitored, and a cardiac echo is planned.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which is currently clinically stable. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels are being monitored serially.
* Renal: The patient is suspected to have renal failure, which is attributed to net diuresis (pre-renal). The patient's fluid status is being closely monitored, and cardiac echo is planned.
* Hematology: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is improving and is attributed to medications.
* Electrolytes: The patient has hypernatremia, which is being treated with free water administration to reduce sodium levels below 147 mmol/L.
* Nutritional support: The patient is to receive total parenteral nutrition (TF) to support their nutritional needs.

The patient's medical history is significant for COPD, left hemidiaphragm paresis, and a history of digoxin toxicity, which has resolved.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 6.5
* Hematocrit (Hct): 30.3
* Platelet count (Plt): 93
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.5
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 28.7
* Glucose: 115
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.5 g/dL
* Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 284 IU/L
* Calcium (Ca++): 9.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4): 4.5 mg/dL

The patient's current medications include:

* Furosemide (Lasix)
* Metoprolol
* Lorazepam (Ativan)
* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Digoxin

The patient's current treatments include:

* BiPAP ventilation
* Total parenteral nutrition (TF)
* Arterial line
* Multi-lumen line
* Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is to remain in the ICU. The patient has been critically ill, and their condition requires ongoing management and close monitoring to prevent complications and improve their chances of recovery."

   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- insufficient progress on BiPAP since
   extubation.  Concern for COPD exacerbation, perhaps CHF, on background
   of left hemidiaphragm paresis.  Plan to repeat intubation to protect
   airway and assist ventilation.  Monitor ABG.  F/U CXR.  Would check
   cardiac echo.  Need to consider trach if no obvious rapidly reversible
   etiology determined.
   GI BLEED -- clinically stable.  Monitor Hct serially.
   A-FIB -- recurrent.  Improved control with prn beta-blocker.  Monitor
   HR.  r/o MI protocol.
   HEMATOMA, Groin -- L >> R.  Clinically stable.  Attributed to
   thrombocytopenia, and perhaps instrumentation vs. spontaneous.
   RENAL FAILURE -- suspect related to net diuresis (pre-renal).  Would
   hold on net diuresis, check Cardiac Echo.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- replete free H2O to Na < 147.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- improving.  Attributed to medications.
   DIGOXIN TOXICITY -- resolved.  Monitor level.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory distress/failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- insufficient progress on BiPAP since
   extubation.  Concern for COPD exacerbation, perhaps CHF, on background
   of left hemidiaphragm paresis.  Plan to repeat intubation to protect
   airway and assist ventilation.  Monitor ABG.  F/U CXR.  Would check
   cardiac echo.  Need to consider trach if no obvious rapidly reversible
   etiology determined.
   GI BLEED -- clinically stable.  Monitor Hct serially.
   A-FIB -- recurrent.  Improved control with prn beta-blocker.  Monitor
   HR.  r/o MI protocol.
   HEMATOMA, Groin -- L >> R.  Clinically stable.  Attributed to
   thrombocytopenia, and perhaps instrumentation vs. spontaneous.
   RENAL FAILURE -- suspect related to net diuresis (pre-renal).  Would
   hold on net diuresis, check Cardiac Echo.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- replete free H2O to Na < 147.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- improving.  Attributed to medications.
   DIGOXIN TOXICITY -- resolved.  Monitor level.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient was extubated yesterday and has been requiring BiPAP due to ventilatory distress. The patient is experiencing some anxiety, which was treated with Ativan 0.5 mg. The patient is also experiencing tachycardia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which was treated with Lopressor IVP.

The patient has a history of left hemidiaphragm paresis, which may be contributing to the respiratory distress. The patient also has a history of COPD exacerbation and possibly CHF. The patient's respiratory status has not improved since extubation, and the plan is to repeat intubation to protect the airway and assist ventilation.

The patient has other comorbidities, including GI bleed, A-fib, renal failure, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, and digoxin toxicity, which are being managed accordingly.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system may increase the risk of infection, which can be life-threatening.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's GI bleed may worsen, leading to hemorrhagic shock or other complications.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to bleeding complications or spontaneous bleeding.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's compromised nutritional status may lead to malnutrition, which can worsen the patient's overall condition.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   Impression: 82 year old female with a history of coronary artery
   disease s/p CABG, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation and
   COPD on home oxygen who presented to OSH on [**2154-11-4**] with hypotension,
   bradycardia and hypercarbic respiratory failure transferred here [**11-9**]
   for management of gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**]. ABG this am 7.38/57/82. CE flat and
   EKG stable yesterday. TTE with no focal wall motion abnormalities
   -Change steroids to Pred 60 daily today

   - sputum cx
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   - completed 5 day course of azithromycin
   -? If HTN and incr HR lead to failure of extubation last time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.0.  Currently 1.5  down from
   1.7 yesterday. (was 2.6 on presentation to [**Location (un) **] on [**2154-11-4**]).
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN. Currently making good urine ouput.
   - will continue to monitor. Will be very cautious with diuresis
   - renally dose medications
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Patient had been having dark guaiac
   positive stools since admission to [**Location (un) **].  No EGD at OSH. Her
   hematocrit on admission was 19.4 and per reports she received 2 units
   of packed red blood cells. [**11-10**] received 2 U PRBC.-  has not received
   any since then. Her hematocrit dropped slightly o/n from 28.7 to 25.6
   without any bloody BM
s. Currently HD stable.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Cardiovascular: Atrial fibrillation, with a rapid ventricular response that improved with IV metoprolol. The patient is currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal bleeding, with a drop in hematocrit from 28.7 to 25.6 without any bloody stool or rectal bleeding.
* Renal: Acute kidney injury, with a baseline creatinine of 1.0 and a current creatinine of 1.5. The patient is making good urine output and will continue to be monitored.
* Hematology: Thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count increasing from a nadir of 56 to 113. The etiology is unclear, but the patient is being monitored and will be transfused for platelets < 50 while actively bleeding.
* Skin: Impaired skin integrity, with a stage II ulcer on the back from a burn injury.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure can lead to further respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation can lead to further cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation, which can be life-threatening.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding can lead to further bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury can lead to further renal failure, which can be life-threatening.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can lead to further bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
* Skin infections: The patient's impaired skin integrity can lead to skin infections, which can be life-threatening.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing invasive ventilation and monitoring of respiratory status.
* Monitoring and managing atrial fibrillation.
* Monitoring and managing gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Monitoring and managing acute kidney injury.
* Monitoring and managing thrombocytopenia.
* Providing wound care and monitoring for skin infections.
* Continuing to monitor the patient's overall condition and adjusting the plan of care as necessary."

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   Impression: 82 year old female with a history of coronary artery
   disease s/p CABG, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation and
   COPD on home oxygen who presented to OSH on [**2154-11-4**] with hypotension,
   bradycardia and hypercarbic respiratory failure now transferred for
   management of gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and now reintubated this
   am. Post intubation abg 7.32/69/188
   - Continue solumedrol 40 [**Hospital1 **] and consider transition to prednisone
   tommorow
   - Vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] day 3 for empiric coverate of nosomial pna
   - sputum cx
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   - completed 5 day course of azithromycin
   -Cycle CE, rpt EKG. TTE ordered.
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.0.  Currently 1.7 up from
   [**11-24**] yesterday. (was 2.6 on presentation to [**Location (un) **] on [**2154-11-4**]).
   Thought tot be [**12-22**] ATN. Currently making good urine ouput.
   - will continue to monitor. Will be very cautious with diuresis
   - renally dose medications
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Patient had been having dark guaiac
   positive stools since admission to [**Location (un) **].  No EGD at OSH. Her
   hematocrit on admission was 19.4 and per reports she received 2 units
   of packed red blood cells. [**11-10**] received 2 U PRBC.-  has not received
   any since then. Her hematocrit is currently 28.7. Currently HD
   stable.
   - active type and screen
   - triple lumen for access, will try for PICC access
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - f/u GI recs
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count increasing from nadir of 56.
   Negative Pf4 from [**2147**]. Now 79.  PF4 antibodies negative.
   - holding heparin products
   - monitor platelet count
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 while actively bleeding
   Atrial Fibrillation:  In rapid ventricular response on admission, which
   improved with IV metoprolol.  Off digoxin and tikosyn since admission
   to outside hospital.
   - continue metoprolol at 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - cont  diltiazem 60 QID
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA)Troponins
   slightly elevated at 0.2 and peaked 0.26.  Trend not available from
   [**Location (un) **]. EKG without ischemic changes.
   - continue simvastatin
   - continue metoprolol
   - cycling CE and checking serial EKG

   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**].  Echocardiogram with preserved systolic function and
   well placed valve at outside hospital. Will recheck TTE today.
   Hypertension:
   - holding antihypertensives today
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure:  Volume overload on CXR with left
   sided effusion s/p thoracentesis with transudate on admission. Now R
   sided effusion and LLL c/w atelectasis
   - goal I/O - 500
   - control blood pressures as tolerated
   - continue beta blocker and calcium channel blocker for atrial
   fibrillation
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD, who was admitted to the hospital with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was initially extubated but re-intubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, and diastolic congestive heart failure. She is currently receiving treatment for these conditions, including antibiotics, antiplatelet therapy, and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is a high-risk condition that requires close monitoring and treatment. The patient may require transfusions, and the bleeding may be difficult to control.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is a serious condition that requires careful monitoring and treatment. The patient may require dialysis, and the condition may be difficult to manage.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is a high-risk condition that requires close monitoring and treatment. The patient may require platelet transfusions, and the condition may be difficult to manage.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is a high-risk condition that requires close monitoring and treatment. The patient may require anticoagulation therapy, and the condition may be difficult to manage.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's coronary artery disease is a high-risk condition that requires close monitoring and treatment. The patient may require further interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, and the condition may be difficult to manage.
6. Aortic Valve Replacement: The patient's aortic valve replacement is a high-risk condition that requires close monitoring and treatment. The patient may require further interventions, such as valve repair or replacement, and the condition may be difficult to manage.
7. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's diastolic congestive heart failure is a high-risk condition that requires close monitoring and treatment. The patient may require further interventions, such as diuretics or vasodilators, and the condition may be difficult to manage.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and adjust treatment as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's acute renal failure and adjust treatment as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's thrombocytopenia and adjust treatment as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and adjust treatment as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's coronary artery disease and adjust treatment as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's aortic valve replacement and adjust treatment as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's diastolic congestive heart failure and adjust treatment as needed.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment as needed to prevent complications and improve outcomes."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 improved following re-intubation.  Suspect
   component of COPD and pulmonary hypertension.  Concern for cardiac
   etiology for respiratory failure, such as cardiac ischemia
 pulmonary
   edema.  Also with valvular heart disease
 s/p AVR.  Need to optimize
   cardiac function.  Otherwise, need to consider trach if no obvious
   rapidly reversible etiology determined.
   GI BLEED -- clinically stable.  Guiac stool.  Monitor Hct serially.
   BRADYCARDIA
 pharmacological related.  Need to assess pharmacological
   agents, optimize regimen.
   A-FIB -- recurrent.  Improved control with prn beta-blocker.  Monitor
   HR.
   ANEMIA
 attributed to groin hematoma and phlebotomy.  Continue
   transfusion to Hct >28
   HEMATOMA, Groin -- L >> R.  Clinically stable.  Attributed to
   thrombocytopenia, and perhaps instrumentation vs. spontaneous.
   Consider imaging to further assess.
   RENAL FAILURE -- suspect related to net diuresis (pre-renal).  Would
   hold on net diuresis, check Cardiac Echo.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- replete free H2O to Na < 147.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- improving.  Attributed to medications.
   DIGOXIN TOXICITY -- resolved.  Monitor Digoxin level.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

* The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure, which is suspected to be related to COPD and pulmonary hypertension.
* The patient experienced bradycardia following beta-blocker dosing, which is being monitored and optimized.
* The patient has anemia attributed to groin hematoma and phlebotomy, and is being transfused to maintain a hemoglobin level above 28.
* The patient has a groin hematoma, which is clinically stable, and may require imaging to further assess.
* The patient is suspected to have renal failure, which is being managed by holding on net diuresis and checking cardiac echo.
* The patient has hypernatremia, which is being repleted with free water to maintain a sodium level below 147.
* The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is improving and is attributed to medications.
* The patient has digoxin toxicity, which has resolved and is being monitored for future levels.
* The patient is being initiated on nutritional support with a fiber source and glycemic control.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: further deterioration of lung function, increased risk of pneumonia, or respiratory arrest.
* Bradycardia: cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, or decreased cardiac output.
* Anemia: increased risk of bleeding, decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, or cardiovascular instability.
* Renal failure: further deterioration of kidney function, increased risk of electrolyte imbalances, or cardiovascular instability.
* Hypernatremia: increased risk of seizures, cerebral edema, or cardiovascular instability.
* Thrombocytopenia: increased risk of bleeding, decreased platelet function, or cardiovascular instability.
* Digoxin toxicity: further cardiac arrhythmias, decreased cardiac output, or cardiovascular instability.

The patient's code status is full code, indicating that all measures should be taken to save the patient's life. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of their various medical conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 improved following re-intubation.  Suspect
   component of COPD and pulmonary hypertension.  Concern for cardiac
   etiology for respiratory failure, such as cardiac ischemia
 pulmonary
   edema.  Also with valvular heart disease
 s/p AVR.  Need to optimize
   cardiac function.  Otherwise, need to consider trach if no obvious
   rapidly reversible etiology determined.
   GI BLEED -- clinically stable.  Guiac stool.  Monitor Hct serially.
   BRADYCARDIA
 pharmacological related.  Need to assess pharmacological
   agents, optimize regimen.
   A-FIB -- recurrent.  Improved control with prn beta-blocker.  Monitor
   HR.
   ANEMIA
 attributed to groin hematoma and phlebotomy.  Continue
   transfusion to Hct >28
   HEMATOMA, Groin -- L >> R.  Clinically stable.  Attributed to
   thrombocytopenia, and perhaps instrumentation vs. spontaneous.
   Consider imaging to further assess.
   RENAL FAILURE -- suspect related to net diuresis (pre-renal).  Would
   hold on net diuresis, check Cardiac Echo.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- replete free H2O to Na < 147.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- improving.  Attributed to medications.
   DIGOXIN TOXICITY -- resolved.  Monitor Digoxin level.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 improved following re-intubation.  Suspect
   component of COPD and pulmonary hypertension.  Concern for cardiac
   etiology for respiratory failure, such as cardiac ischemia
 pulmonary
   edema.  Also with valvular heart disease
 s/p AVR.  Need to optimize
   cardiac function.  Otherwise, need to consider trach if no obvious
   rapidly reversible etiology determined.
   GI BLEED -- clinically stable.  Guiac stool.  Monitor Hct serially.
   BRADYCARDIA
 pharmacological related.  Need to assess pharmacological
   agents, optimize regimen.
   A-FIB -- recurrent.  Improved control with prn beta-blocker.  Monitor
   HR.
   ANEMIA
 attributed to groin hematoma and phlebotomy.  Continue
   transfusion to Hct >28
   HEMATOMA, Groin -- L >> R.  Clinically stable.  Attributed to
   thrombocytopenia, and perhaps instrumentation vs. spontaneous.
   Consider imaging to further assess.
   RENAL FAILURE -- suspect related to net diuresis (pre-renal).  Would
   hold on net diuresis, check Cardiac Echo.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- replete free H2O to Na < 147.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- improving.  Attributed to medications.
   DIGOXIN TOXICITY -- resolved.  Monitor Digoxin level.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 50 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* Heart rate: 84 bpm (normal range: 36-84 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 160/55 mmHg (normal range: 119-173/45-111 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 18 inspirations per minute (normal range: 9-18 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%

The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary hypertension, which may be contributing to their respiratory failure. The patient also has valvular heart disease, which may be a potential cardiac etiology for their respiratory failure.

The patient has experienced bradycardia following beta-blocker dosing and has a history of atrial fibrillation, which has been controlled with prn beta-blocker. They also have anemia, attributed to groin hematoma and phlebotomy, and are receiving transfusions to maintain a hemoglobin level greater than 28%.

The patient has a groin hematoma, which is clinically stable, and is suspected to be related to thrombocytopenia and instrumentation. They also have renal failure, which is suspected to be related to net diuresis, and are holding on net diuresis and checking cardiac echo.

The patient has hypernatremia, which is being repleted with free water to maintain a sodium level less than 147 mmol/L. They also have thrombocytopenia, which is improving and is attributed to medications.

The patient's nutritional support consists of initiating tube feeding, and their glycemic control is being monitored. They have an arterial line, multi-lumen line, and PICC line in place.

The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is ICU.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further compromise of their lung function.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac condition, including valvular heart disease and atrial fibrillation, may worsen, leading to cardiac ischemia, pulmonary edema, or other cardiac complications.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to further compromise of their oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen, leading to further compromise of their kidney function.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may worsen, leading to further electrolyte imbalance and potential complications.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to further bleeding complications.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), given their prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status is essential to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD who presented to the hospital with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was intubated and treated with antibiotics for gastrointestinal bleeding. She has a history of cardiac surgery, including CABG and aortic valve replacement, and is currently experiencing acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.0 to 1.5, and she is at risk for further kidney damage if not managed properly.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has been experiencing dark guaiac-positive stools since admission, and her hematocrit has dropped slightly overnight. She is at risk for further bleeding and may require transfusions.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is increasing, but she is still at risk for bleeding due to her low platelet count.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is not well-controlled, and she is at risk for further cardiac complications if not managed properly.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia and is at risk for further cardiovascular complications if not managed properly.
6. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure and is at risk for further cardiac complications if not managed properly.
7. Back Wound: The patient has a stage II ulcer on her back from a burn injury and is at risk for further infection and complications if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust her diuretic regimen as needed to prevent further kidney damage.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and consider transfusions if necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's platelet count and transfuse if necessary to prevent bleeding.
4. Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation and consider anticoagulation therapy if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's lipids and adjust her medication regimen as necessary to prevent further cardiovascular complications.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust her medication regimen as necessary to prevent further cardiac complications.
7. Continue to manage the patient's back wound and consider wound care consultation if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female who presented to the hospital with hypercarbic respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and atrial fibrillation. She has a history of coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was previously extubated but required reintubation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and diastolic congestive heart failure. She is currently being treated with steroids, antibiotics, and diuretics, and is receiving ongoing care in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and she may require ongoing mechanical ventilation to support her respiratory function.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is ongoing, and she may require continued monitoring and treatment to prevent further bleeding.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is a concern, and she may require ongoing dialysis to support her renal function.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is a concern, and she may require ongoing platelet transfusions to support her platelet count.
5. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's diastolic congestive heart failure is a concern, and she may require ongoing diuretic therapy to manage her fluid status.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is a concern, and she may require ongoing anticoagulation therapy to prevent stroke.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia is a concern, and she may require ongoing lipid-lowering therapy to manage her lipid levels.
8. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's coronary artery disease is a concern, and she may require ongoing monitoring and treatment to manage her cardiac function.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory function and adjust her ventilator settings as necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and adjust her treatment plan as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her diuretic therapy as necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust her platelet transfusion plan as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust her treatment plan as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's lipid levels and adjust her lipid-lowering therapy as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust her treatment plan as necessary.
8. Consider referring the patient to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management of her coronary artery disease."

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   Impression: 82 year old female with a history of coronary artery
   disease s/p CABG, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation and
   COPD on home oxygen who presented to OSH on [**2154-11-4**] with hypotension,
   bradycardia and hypercarbic respiratory failure transferred here [**11-9**]
   for management of gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**]. ABG this am 7.38/57/82. CE flat and
   EKG stable yesterday. TTE with no focal wall motion abnormalities
   -Change steroids to Pred 60 daily today
   - Vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] day 4 (of 8) for empiric coverate of nosomial pna
   - sputum cx
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   - completed 5 day course of azithromycin
   -? If HTN and incr HR lead to failure of extubation last time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.0.  Currently 1.5  down from
   1.7 yesterday. (was 2.6 on presentation to [**Location (un) **] on [**2154-11-4**]).
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN. Currently making good urine ouput.
   - will continue to monitor. Will be very cautious with diuresis
   - renally dose medications
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Patient had been having dark guaiac
   positive stools since admission to [**Location (un) **].  No EGD at OSH. Her
   hematocrit on admission was 19.4 and per reports she received 2 units
   of packed red blood cells. [**11-10**] received 2 U PRBC.-  has not received
   any since then. Her hematocrit dropped slightly o/n from 28.7 to 25.6
   without any bloody BM
s. Currently HD stable.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - f/u GI recs
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count increasing from nadir of 56. Now
   113.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - holding heparin products
   - monitor platelet count
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 while actively bleeding
   Atrial Fibrillation:  In rapid ventricular response on admission, which
   improved with IV metoprolol.  Off digoxin and tikosyn since admission
   to outside hospital.
   -holding   diltiazem for now
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA). EKG
   without ischemic changes and CE flat yesterday.
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg today after bradycardia and hypotension
   yesterday.
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   Hypertension:
   - started Coreg today
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure:  Volume overload on CXR with left
   sided effusion s/p thoracentesis with transudate on admission. Now R
   sided effusion and LLL c/w atelectasis
   - goal I/O
 500 today
   - control blood pressures as tolerated
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **].
   - Silvadene 1% cream to coccyx [**Hospital1 **]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was initially intubated and treated for gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.38, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 57 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 82 mmHg.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has atrial fibrillation and is in rapid ventricular response. Her blood pressure is 149/62 mmHg, and her heart rate is 79 beats per minute (bpm). She has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has gastrointestinal bleeding and is receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, with a baseline creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL and a current creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL. She is producing urine and is not receiving dialysis.
* Hematological: The patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 113 x 10^9/L. She is receiving platelet transfusions.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may require continued mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may continue, and she may require further treatment with PPI therapy and/or endoscopic therapy.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, and she may require dialysis if her creatinine level continues to rise.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, and she may require further platelet transfusions to maintain adequate platelet counts.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may continue, and she may require further treatment with antiarrhythmic medications or cardioversion.
* Coronary artery disease: The patient's coronary artery disease may worsen, and she may require further treatment with antiplatelet therapy and/or revascularization procedures.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation
* Further treatment with PPI therapy and/or endoscopic therapy for gastrointestinal bleeding
* Monitoring of renal function and consideration of dialysis if necessary
* Platelet transfusions to maintain adequate platelet counts
* Antiarrhythmic medications or cardioversion to treat atrial fibrillation
* Antiplatelet therapy and/or revascularization procedures to treat coronary artery disease."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD who presented to the hospital with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was initially intubated and later extubated but had to be reintubated due to persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient has several comorbidities, including:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: She has been experiencing dark guaiac-positive stools since admission, and her hematocrit has dropped slightly overnight.
2. Acute renal failure: Her baseline creatinine was 1.0, but it has increased to 1.5, and she is currently making good urine output.
3. Thrombocytopenia: Her platelet count is increasing from a nadir of 56, and she has been holding heparin products.
4. Atrial fibrillation: She has been in rapid ventricular response on admission, which improved with IV metoprolol, and she is currently not anticoagulated due to gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Coronary artery disease: She has a history of CABG and has been taking simvastatin.
6. Aortic valve replacement: She has a bioprosthetic valve and is not anticoagulated.
7. Hypertension: She has been started on Coreg, and her blood pressure is being controlled as tolerated.
8. Diastolic congestive heart failure: She has a volume overload on CXR with left-sided effusion, which has improved with thoracentesis.

The patient is currently receiving the following treatments:

1. Steroids: She has been started on a steroid taper.
2. Antibiotics: She has been receiving Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for empiric coverage of nosocomial pneumonia.
3. Diuresis: She has been receiving lasix IV, but it has been held due to mostly free water boluses and her hypernatremic and volume-contracted status.
4. Prophylaxis: She is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, and blood pressure of 149/62 mmHg. Her respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 98% and a respiratory rate of 19 inspirations per minute.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is ongoing, and she may require further treatment, such as endoscopy or surgery.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, and she may require further treatment, such as dialysis.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is increasing, but she may require further treatment, such as platelet transfusions.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may require further treatment, such as cardioversion or anticoagulation.
5. Coronary artery disease: The patient's coronary artery disease may require further treatment, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery.
6. Aortic valve replacement: The patient's aortic valve replacement may require further treatment, such as anticoagulation or replacement.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may require further treatment, such as medications or lifestyle changes.
8. Diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient's diastolic congestive heart failure may require further treatment, such as diuretics or vasodilators.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she requires close monitoring and treatment to manage her various comorbidities and potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female who presented to the hospital with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was transferred to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleeding and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. Her oxygen saturation is 98%.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has atrial fibrillation and is receiving metoprolol for rate control. Her blood pressure is 149/62 mmHg.
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has gastrointestinal bleeding and is receiving proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for prophylaxis.
* Renal status: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL. She is receiving fluids and diuretics to manage her volume status.
* Hematological status: The patient has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 106 K/uL. She is receiving platelet transfusions as needed.
* Neurological status: The patient is sedated and has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may require further interventions to improve her oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, and further management is needed to control the bleeding and prevent further complications.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's AKI may progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not managed properly.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to bleeding complications.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to further complications, such as stroke or heart failure, if not managed properly.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as heart failure or stroke.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. The plan is to continue to manage her respiratory status, gastrointestinal bleeding, and renal function. The patient will also require further management of her atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and thrombocytopenia."

   disease s/p CABG, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation and
   COPD on home oxygen who presented to OSH on [**2154-11-4**] with hypotension,
   bradycardia and hypercarbic respiratory failure transferred here [**11-9**]
   for management of gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**]. CE flat and EKG stable [**11-12**]. TTE
   with no focal wall motion abnormalities

   1.5 yesterday. (was 2.6 on presentation to [**Location (un) **] on [**2154-11-4**]).
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN. Currently making good urine ouput.
   - will continue to monitor. Will be very cautious with diuresis
   - renally dose medications
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Patient had been having dark guaiac
   positive stools since admission to [**Location (un) **].  No EGD at OSH. Her
   hematocrit on admission was 19.4 and per reports she received 2 units
   of packed red blood cells. [**11-10**] received 2 U PRBC.-  has not received
   any since then. Her hematocrit here has been stable around 25 (24.6
   today) without any bloody BM
s. Currently HD stable.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count increasing from nadir of 56. Now
   106.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - holding heparin products
   - monitor platelet count
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   Atrial Fibrillation:  In rapid ventricular response on admission, which
   improved with IV metoprolol.  Off digoxin and tikosyn since admission
   to outside hospital.
   -holding  diltiazem for now
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA). EKG
   without ischemic changes and CE flat yesterday.
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   Hypertension:
   - cont Coreg
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure:  Volume overload on CXR with left
   sided effusion s/p thoracentesis with transudate on admission. Now R
   sided effusion and LLL c/w atelectasis
   - goal I/O  equal today
   - control blood pressures as tolerated
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, s/p CABG and aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and COPD on home oxygen. She presented to the hospital with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and was transferred to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient has been experiencing several medical complications, including:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.0 to 1.5, and she has been making good urine output. The impression is that she may have ATN, and the plan is to continue monitoring and be cautious with diuresis.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has been experiencing dark guaiac-positive stools since admission, and has received 2 units of packed red blood cells. Her hematocrit has been stable around 25, and she is being actively typed and screened for transfusion.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been increasing from a nadir of 56 to 106, and PF4 antibodies have been negative. The plan is to hold heparin products, monitor platelet count, and transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient was in rapid ventricular response on admission, but improved with IV metoprolol. She is currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of s/p CABG and is currently on simvastatin.
6. Aortic Valve Replacement: The patient has a bioprosthetic aortic valve and is not anticoagulated.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is being controlled with Coreg.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is being treated with simvastatin.
9. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has volume overload on CXR with a left-sided effusion, which was drained with a transudate. She now has a right-sided effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis.
10. Back Wound: The patient has a stage II ulcer on her back from a burn injury, and is being treated with Silvadene cream and wound care consultation.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* T: 36.7°C (98°F)
* HR: 89 bpm (74-100)
* BP: 148/62 mmHg (92-168/75-293)
* RR: 19 breaths/min (17-48)
* SpO2: 94%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 7.7-9.7 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 24.6-26.7%
* Plt: 105-113 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 1.3-1.5 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.17-0.20 ng/mL
* TCO2: 35-37 mmHg

The patient's current medications include:

* Coreg 6.25 PO BID
* Prednisone 40 daily
* Vancomycin (day 5 of 8)
* Azithromycin (completed 5-day course)
* Advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
* Simvastatin
* Metoprolol (switched to Coreg on 11/13)

The patient's plan includes:

* Monitoring for gastrointestinal bleeding and acute renal failure
* Continuing to control blood pressure and monitor for signs of volume overload
* Managing atrial fibrillation and thrombocytopenia
* Continuing wound care for the back wound
* Monitoring for signs of hypercarbic respiratory failure
* Continuing to monitor for signs of coronary artery disease and aortic valve replacement

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -Steroid 40 PO BID today, then 20 PO BID tomorrow
   continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - Vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] day 5 (of 8) for empiric coverate of nosomial pna
   - sputum cx pending
   For Cardiac optimization:
   -Increase Coreg to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   -Lasix Diuresis for net -1L
   -transfuse 1unit PRBCs for HCT >25 given evidence of end organ ischemia
   (cardiac)
   -possible to extubate patient on IV nitro to prevent pulmonary flash
   edema.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Back to baseline Cr of 1.0, with good UOP.
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN.
   .
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable.  No EGD only evidence for GI
   bleed is guaiac positive stool on admission.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25 (t
fuse one unit today as above)
   - PO PPI daily
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count increasing from nadir of 56. Now
   105.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - holding heparin products
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
    .
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient tachycardic overnight, but with recent
   bradycardia [**12-22**] beta blockers.
   -start dilt 30 PO QID ([**11-21**] daily home dose)
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Will consider restarting next week if patient stable,
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA). EKG
   without ischemic changes and CE flat yesterday.
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   .
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension:
   - cont Coreg
   -start diltiazem as above
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   .

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD, who was admitted to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. Her medications include Coreg, prednisone, vancomycin, meropenem, and antibiotics. Her laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, abnormal liver function tests, and acute kidney injury. She has a new plaque-like rash on her feet and is experiencing hypertension, tachycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows a possible pneumonia, which could worsen her respiratory status and increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating acute kidney injury. This could lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is ongoing, and she is at risk of further bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and other complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which could increase the risk of bleeding and other complications.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is not well-controlled, which could lead to further complications, such as stroke and heart failure.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is not well-controlled, which could lead to further complications, such as heart failure, kidney damage, and stroke.
7. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure is ongoing, which could lead to further complications, such as respiratory failure and acidosis.
8. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and gastrointestinal bleeding could lead to systemic infections, which could worsen her overall condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory status closely.
2. Adjust the patient's medications as needed to control her hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
3. Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's treatment regimen if the pneumonia is confirmed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and adjust her treatment regimen as needed.
5. Consider transfusing the patient with platelets if her platelet count remains low.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her treatment regimen as needed.
7. Consider adding a stress ulcer prophylaxis to the patient's treatment regimen to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Consider adding a VAP prophylaxis to the patient's treatment regimen to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 improved following re-intubation.  Suspect
   component of COPD and pulmonary hypertension.  Concern for cardiac
   etiology for respiratory failure, such as cardiac ischemia
 pulmonary
   edema.  Also with valvular heart disease s/p AVR.  Need to optimize
   cardiac function.  Otherwise, need to consider trach if no obvious
   rapidly reversible etiology determined.
   GI BLEED -- clinically stable.  Continue to guiac stool.  Monitor Hct
   serially.  No plans for endoscopy at this time.
   BRADYCARDIA
 pharmacological related.  Now off beta-blockers.
   A-FIB/FLUTTER -- recurrent A-fib, now flutter.  Rate control with
   Diltiazem.  Consider anticoagulation.
   ANEMIA
 attributed to groin hematoma and phlebotomy.  Continue
   transfusion to Hct >28.
   HEMATOMA, Groin -- L >> R.  Clinically stable.  Attributed to
   thrombocytopenia, and perhaps instrumentation vs. spontaneous.
   Consider imaging to further assess.
   RENAL FAILURE -- suspect related to net diuresis (pre-renal).  Would
   hold on net diuresis, check Cardiac Echo.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- improving.  Attributed to medications.
   DIGOXIN TOXICITY -- resolved.  Monitor Digoxin level.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, requiring re-intubation and mechanical ventilation. They have a history of COPD, pulmonary hypertension, and valvular heart disease following an aortic valve replacement (AVR). The patient is also experiencing anemia, likely attributed to groin hematoma and phlebotomy. Other issues include bradycardia, atrial flutter, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and digoxin toxicity.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation.
	* Ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI) or ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).
	* Respiratory failure progression, requiring increased support or alternative ventilation strategies.
2. Cardiac Complications:
	* Cardiac ischemia or infarction due to pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease, or cardiac ischemia.
	* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or flutter, which may require further management or cardioversion.
	* Cardiac failure or worsening of cardiac function, potentially leading to increased morbidity and mortality.
3. Hematological Complications:
	* Further bleeding or hematoma formation due to thrombocytopenia or ongoing anticoagulation.
	* Anemia worsening or development of other blood disorders, such as thrombocytosis or leukopenia.
4. Renal Complications:
	* Progressive renal failure, potentially leading to acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
	* Fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances due to net diuresis or inadequate fluid management.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to prolonged mechanical ventilation, stress ulceration, or underlying gastrointestinal disease.
	* Nutritional deficiencies or malabsorption due to impaired gut function or inadequate nutritional support.
6. Infection and Sepsis:
	* Development of hospital-acquired infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), or bloodstream infection (BSI).
	* Sepsis or septic shock, potentially leading to multi-organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
7. Other Complications:
	* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility, venous stasis, or underlying thrombophilia.
	* Neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or encephalopathy, potentially related to cardiac or respiratory failure, or underlying neurological disease.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, close monitoring and aggressive management of these potential complications are crucial to optimize their outcome and prevent further deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 improved following re-intubation.  Suspect
   component of COPD and pulmonary hypertension.  Concern for cardiac
   etiology for respiratory failure, such as cardiac ischemia
 pulmonary
   edema.  Also with valvular heart disease s/p AVR.  Need to optimize
   cardiac function.  Otherwise, need to consider trach if no obvious
   rapidly reversible etiology determined.
   GI BLEED -- clinically stable.  Continue to guiac stool.  Monitor Hct
   serially.  No plans for endoscopy at this time.
   BRADYCARDIA
 pharmacological related.  Now off beta-blockers.
   A-FIB/FLUTTER -- recurrent A-fib, now flutter.  Rate control with
   Diltiazem.  Consider anticoagulation.
   ANEMIA
 attributed to groin hematoma and phlebotomy.  Continue
   transfusion to Hct >28.
   HEMATOMA, Groin -- L >> R.  Clinically stable.  Attributed to
   thrombocytopenia, and perhaps instrumentation vs. spontaneous.
   Consider imaging to further assess.
   RENAL FAILURE -- suspect related to net diuresis (pre-renal).  Would
   hold on net diuresis, check Cardiac Echo.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- improving.  Attributed to medications.
   DIGOXIN TOXICITY -- resolved.  Monitor Digoxin level.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   GI BLEED -- clinically stable.  Continue to guiac stool.  Monitor Hct
   serially.  No plans for endoscopy at this time.
   BRADYCARDIA
 pharmacological related.  Now off beta-blockers.
   A-FIB/FLUTTER -- recurrent A-fib, now flutter.  Rate control with
   Diltiazem.  Consider anticoagulation.
   ANEMIA
 attributed to groin hematoma and phlebotomy.  Continue
   transfusion to Hct >28.
   HEMATOMA, Groin -- L >> R.  Clinically stable.  Attributed to
   thrombocytopenia, and perhaps instrumentation vs. spontaneous.
   Consider imaging to further assess.
   RENAL FAILURE -- suspect related to net diuresis (pre-renal).  Would
   hold on net diuresis, check Cardiac Echo.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- improving.  Attributed to medications.
   DIGOXIN TOXICITY -- resolved.  Monitor Digoxin level.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated with a diagnosis of respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 175/70 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode, Vt (set) of 400 mL, and FiO2 of 35%.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a normal temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. The patient's lungs are clear to auscultation, and there are no signs of respiratory distress. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present.

Laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, and there is concern for cardiac etiology of respiratory failure. The patient's electrocardiogram shows atrial flutter.

The patient's medications include beta-blockers, which were stopped due to bradycardia. The patient is receiving digoxin, which was previously toxic, and is now being monitored. The patient is also receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem.

The patient's plan includes optimization of cardiac function, consideration of tracheostomy if no obvious reversible etiology is determined, and continued transfusions to maintain a hemoglobin level greater than 28.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the underlying cause is not addressed.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, and there is concern for cardiac etiology of respiratory failure. This may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not treated, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cardiac output.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen if not treated, leading to bleeding complications.
5. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen if not treated, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and cardiac complications.
6. Infection: The patient's respiratory failure and anemia may increase the risk of infection.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's anemia and respiratory failure may increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia and respiratory failure may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABB and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD. Quite
   alkalotic on ABG today, likely contraction alkalosis from overdiuresis.
   For COPD:
   -Steroid 40 PO BID today, then 20 PO BID tomorrow
   continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - Vanco (today is last day) /[**Last Name (un) **] day 7 (of 8) for empiric coverate of
   nosomial pna
   - sputum cx pending
   For Cardiac optimization:
   -cont Coreg to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   - decreased dilt to 15 QID
   -Diamox Diuresis for net -1L
   -if  extubatable, use IV nitro to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Back to baseline Cr of 1.0, with good UOP.
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN.  No ACEI for now
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT dwindling down w/ inc to 28 after 1 U
   PRBCs yesterday.   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive
   stool on admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large
   ecchymosis surrounding L upper leg.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25 (t
fuse one unit today as above)
   - PO PPI daily
   - rpt PM Hct w/ Abd CT to assess for RP bleed if continues to decrease.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count increasing from nadir of 56. Now
   105.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - no heparin given hx of GI bleed
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient tachycardic overnight, but with recent
   bradycardia [**12-22**] beta blockers.
   - [**Month (only) 38**] dilt to 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Will consider restarting next week if patient stable,
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA). EKG
   without ischemic changes and CE flat yesterday.
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - no ASA given GI bleed.
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension:
   - cont Coreg
   -start diltiazem as above
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **].
   - Silvadene 1% cream to coccyx [**Hospital1 **]
   - wound care consulted

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  82 yo F with CAD s/p CABG/AVR c/b L
   diaphragm paralysis, a-fib, COPD on home O2 (chronic CO2 retainer)
   admitted initially to OSH with bradycardia, HOTN, unresponsiveness, ARF
   (atn), GIB and acute on chronic hypercarbic resp failure. Transferred
   to [**Hospital1 54**] for management of GIB.  Course has been c/b thrombocytopenia
   felt [**12-22**] medication (zosyn), failed extubation in setting of flash pulm
   edema and ? aspiration, and hypertension.
        Weaned to PSV yesterday but unable to tolerate secondary
   todevelopment of CO2 retention/resp acidosis.  Coreg started for
   hypertension with improvement. Dilt  restarted ([**11-21**] home dose) with
   improved rate control though noted to have sinus pauses this am.
   Transfused 1 unit PRBC for slow hct drop.  Self-d/c'd a-line this
   am
minimal bleeding.

     * anemia
         GIB
         Groin hematoma
     * a-fib/bradycardia/sinus pauses
     * thrombocytopenia (from zosyn?, hit neg)
     * hyperglycemia
   Difficult respiratory status with significant underlying copd and pHTN
   possibly confounded by pulm edema and potential cardiac component with
   tachycardia/afib. Has now failed extubation and weaning trials.  Is
   likely heading toward trach
await family mtg to discuss goals of care.
   Agree with plan to;
        Continue to optimize volume and cardiac status, though would hold
   on additional diuresis for now and allow auto-diruesis.  Has developed
   sig resp alkalosis with known chronic CO2 retention which likely
   further prevented successful wean.  If unable to meet neg fluid balance
   would consider diamox.  As did not tolerate wean
would rest on ACV at
   this time.  Will taper prednisone and continue MDIs, sx, and pulm
   toilet.  Will completing 8 day course of vanco/[**Last Name (un) 430**] for pna (last day
   vanco today, [**Last Name (un) 430**] tomorrow).  Would consider obtaining TTE.
        Renal failure improving slowly and now with good urine.
        Anemia stable (s/p 1 unit transfusion) suspect multifactorial
   etiology with slow GIB, hematoma, phlebotomy.  GI has signed off
   without plans for scope. Continue to guiac stool.  Monitor hematoma on
   groin and back.  Follow h/h, keeping active T and C, and consider
   obtaining abd/pelvic CT to eval for RP bleed if continued drop. Did
   show appropriate response to transfusion.
        Thrombocytopenia stable and felt likely [**12-22**] med effecrt.  Continue
   to monitor.
        Bradycardia recurrent after resuming BB and dilt for a-fib rate
   control.  Will decrease dilt dose and continue coreg for now monitoring
   closely.  Off dig (dig toxic at admit). Continue to hold anticoag given
   thrombocytopenia and anemia.
        Continue ICU prophylaxis.  Has picc line for access. .  Self-d/c'd
   aline.   TFs at goal. SSI--will tighten, now also decreasing prednisone
   dosing which may help further.
   Family expected today for family mtg, update, and goals of
   carediscussion.

   Assessment and Plan
Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABB and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD. Quite
   alkalotic on ABG today, likely contraction alkalosis from overdiuresis.
   For COPD:
   -Steroid 40 PO BID today, then 20 PO BID tomorrow
   continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - Vanco (today is last day) /[**Last Name (un) **] day 7 (of 8) for empiric coverate of
   nosomial pna
   - sputum cx pending
   For Cardiac optimization:
   -cont Coreg to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   - decreased dilt to 15 QID
   -Diamox Diuresis for net -1L
   -if  extubatable, use IV nitro to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Back to baseline Cr of 1.0, with good UOP.
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN.  No ACEI for now
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT dwindling down w/ inc to 28 after 1 U
   PRBCs yesterday.   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive
   stool on admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large
   ecchymosis surrounding L upper leg.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25 (t
fuse one unit today as above)
   - PO PPI daily
   - rpt PM Hct w/ Abd CT to assess for RP bleed if continues to decrease.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count increasing from nadir of 56. Now
   105.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - no heparin given hx of GI bleed
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient tachycardic overnight, but with recent
   bradycardia [**12-22**] beta blockers.
   - [**Month (only) 38**] dilt to 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Will consider restarting next week if patient stable,
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA). EKG
   without ischemic changes and CE flat yesterday.
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - no ASA given GI bleed.
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension:
   - cont Coreg
   -start diltiazem as above
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **].
   - Silvadene 1% cream to coccyx [**Hospital1 **]
   - wound care consulted

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  82 yo F with CAD s/p CABG/AVR c/b L
   diaphragm paralysis, a-fib, COPD on home O2 (chronic CO2 retainer)
   admitted initially to OSH with bradycardia, HOTN, unresponsiveness, ARF
   (atn), GIB and acute on chronic hypercarbic resp failure. Transferred
   to [**Hospital1 54**] for management of GIB.  Course has been c/b thrombocytopenia
   felt [**12-22**] medication (zosyn), failed extubation in setting of flash pulm
   edema and ? aspiration, and hypertension.
        Weaned to PSV yesterday but unable to tolerate secondary
   todevelopment of CO2 retention/resp acidosis.  Coreg started for
   hypertension with improvement. Dilt  restarted ([**11-21**] home dose) with
   improved rate control though noted to have sinus pauses this am.
   Transfused 1 unit PRBC for slow hct drop.  Self-d/c'd a-line this
   am

     * thrombocytopenia (from zosyn?, hit neg)
     * hyperglycemia
   Difficult respiratory status with significant underlying copd and pHTN
   possibly confounded by pulm edema and potential cardiac component with
   tachycardia/afib. Has now failed extubation and weaning trials.  Is
   likely heading toward trach
await family mtg to discuss goals of care.
   Agree with plan to;
        Continue to optimize volume and cardiac status, though would hold
   on additional diuresis for now and allow auto-diruesis.  Has developed
   sig resp alkalosis with known chronic CO2 retention which likely
   further prevented successful wean.  If unable to meet neg fluid balance
   would consider diamox.  As did not tolerate wean
would rest on ACV at
   this time.  Will taper prednisone and continue MDIs, sx, and pulm
   toilet.  Will completing 8 day course of vanco/[**Last Name (un) 430**] for pna (last day
   vanco today, [**Last Name (un) 430**] tomorrow).  Would consider obtaining TTE.
        Renal failure improving slowly and now with good urine.
        Anemia stable (s/p 1 unit transfusion) suspect multifactorial
   etiology with slow GIB, hematoma, phlebotomy.  GI has signed off
   without plans for scope. Continue to guiac stool.  Monitor hematoma on
   groin and back.  Follow h/h, keeping active T and C, and consider
   obtaining abd/pelvic CT to eval for RP bleed if continued drop. Did
   show appropriate response to transfusion.
        Thrombocytopenia stable and felt likely [**12-22**] med effecrt.  Continue
   to monitor.
        Bradycardia recurrent after resuming BB and dilt for a-fib rate
   control.  Will decrease dilt dose and continue coreg for now monitoring
   closely.  Off dig (dig toxic at admit). Continue to hold anticoag given
   thrombocytopenia and anemia.
        Continue ICU prophylaxis.  Has picc line for access. .  Self-d/c'd
   aline.   TFs at goal. SSI--will tighten, now also decreasing prednisone
   dosing which may help further.
   Family expected today for family mtg, update, and goals of
   carediscussion.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill
   Total time: 50 min
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 744**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1165**], MD
   on:[**2154-11-16**] 04:25 PM ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's current condition is critical, with significant respiratory failure, acute renal failure, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. She is intubated and ventilated, and has failed multiple extubation attempts due to persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure and flash pulmonary edema.

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 9.1
* HCT: 28.9
* Plt: 105
* INR: 1.0
* Na: 143
* Cr: 1.1
* Albumin: 3.5 g/dL
* LDH: 284 IU/L
* Ca++: 8.5 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL
* PO4: 2.6 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is notable for a cachectic appearance, dependent edema, and diffuse ecchymosis on the back, groin, and thighs.

The patient's medical issues include:

* Respiratory failure: COPD with chronic CO2 retention, pneumonia, and potential cardiac component with tachycardia/atrial fibrillation.
* Acute renal failure: likely due to ATN, with a slow improvement in renal function.
* Anemia: likely multifactorial, with slow gastrointestinal bleeding, hematoma, and phlebotomy.
* Thrombocytopenia: likely secondary to Zosyn or other medication, with a stable platelet count.
* Bradycardia: recurrent after resuming beta blockers and diltiazem for atrial fibrillation rate control.
* Hyperglycemia: likely due to insulin resistance and chronic disease.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue to optimize volume and cardiac status, with caution regarding diuresis and anticoagulation.
* Taper prednisone and continue MDIs, sputum, and pulmonary toilet.
* Complete the 8-day course of vancomycin for pneumonia.
* Consider obtaining a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) to evaluate cardiac function.
* Monitor hematoma on the groin and back, and consider obtaining an abdominal/pelvic CT to evaluate for retroperitoneal bleeding if the hemoglobin drops.
* Continue to monitor thrombocytopenia and adjust treatment accordingly.
* Hold anticoagulation and digoxin due to thrombocytopenia and anemia.
* Continue ICU prophylaxis, including stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP prevention.

The patient is expected to have a family meeting today to discuss goals of care, including the possibility of tracheostomy if unable to wean off the ventilator."

   Assessment and Plan
Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABB and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD. Quite
   alkalotic on ABG today, likely contraction alkalosis from overdiuresis.
   For COPD:
   -Steroid 40 PO BID today, then 20 PO BID tomorrow
   continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - Vanco (today is last day) /[**Last Name (un) **] day 7 (of 8) for empiric coverate of
   nosomial pna
   - sputum cx pending
   For Cardiac optimization:
   -cont Coreg to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   - decreased dilt to 15 QID
   -Diamox Diuresis for net -1L
   -if  extubatable, use IV nitro to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Back to baseline Cr of 1.0, with good UOP.
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN.  No ACEI for now
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT dwindling down w/ inc to 28 after 1 U
   PRBCs yesterday.   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive
   stool on admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large
   ecchymosis surrounding L upper leg.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25 (t
fuse one unit today as above)
   - PO PPI daily
   - rpt PM Hct w/ Abd CT to assess for RP bleed if continues to decrease.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count increasing from nadir of 56. Now
   105.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - no heparin given hx of GI bleed
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient tachycardic overnight, but with recent
   bradycardia [**12-22**] beta blockers.
   - [**Month (only) 38**] dilt to 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Will consider restarting next week if patient stable,
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA). EKG
   without ischemic changes and CE flat yesterday.
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - no ASA given GI bleed.
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension:
   - cont Coreg
   -start diltiazem as above
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **].
   - Silvadene 1% cream to coccyx [**Hospital1 **]
   - wound care consulted

   status to DNR. While consider trach for now if there is possibility of
   weaning patient off the vent. Otherwise, if unable to wean off vent,
   patient would prefer not to be on vent indefinitely and would prefer
   adding DNI/CMO status.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided daily progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition and potential medical complications as follows:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is an 82-year-old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD, admitted to the ICU for management of GI bleed and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
* She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
* Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure of 135/54 mmHg.
* She has a history of GI bleed, and her hematocrit has decreased to 28.9% after receiving 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
* She has a platelet count of 105 K/uL, which is increasing from a nadir of 56.
* She has a history of atrial fibrillation, and her rhythm is currently atrial flutter.
* She has a history of coronary artery disease, s/p CABG, and aortic valve replacement.
* She has a stage II ulcer on her back from a burn injury.
* She is receiving various medications, including Coreg, diltiazem, furosemide, and insulin sliding scale.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is increasing, and she has a history of AKI.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure is ongoing, and she is dependent on mechanical ventilation.
* GI bleed: The patient's GI bleed is ongoing, and she is at risk of further bleeding.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is increasing, but she is at risk of further bleeding.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is ongoing, and she is at risk of developing pulmonary edema.
* Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of CAD, and she is at risk of developing further cardiac complications.
* Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and she is at risk of developing further hypertension-related complications.

**Plan:**

* Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and adjust her settings as needed.
* Monitor the patient's GI bleed and consider further interventions if necessary.
* Monitor the patient's platelet count and transfuse if necessary.
* Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with medication and consider further interventions if necessary.
* Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider further interventions if necessary.
* Consider weaning the patient off the vent if possible, and discuss DNR status with the family."

   Assessment and Plan
Impression: 82 year old female with a history of coronary artery
   disease s/p CABG, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation and
   COPD on home oxygen who presented to OSH on [**2154-11-4**] with hypotension,
   bradycardia and hypercarbic respiratory failure transferred here [**11-9**]
   for management of gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -Steroid 40 PO BID today, then 20 PO BID tomorrow
   continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - Vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] day 5 (of 8) for empiric coverate of nosomial pna
   - sputum cx pending
   For Cardiac optimization:
   -Increase Coreg to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   -Lasix Diuresis for net -1L
   -transfuse 1unit PRBCs for HCT >25 given evidence of end organ ischemia
   (cardiac)
   -possible to extubate patient on IV nitro to prevent pulmonary flash
   edema.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Back to baseline Cr of 1.0, with good UOP.
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN.
   .
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable.  No EGD only evidence for GI
   bleed is guaiac positive stool on admission.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25 (t
fuse one unit today as above)
   - PO PPI daily
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count increasing from nadir of 56. Now
   105.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - holding heparin products
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
    .
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient tachycardic overnight, but with recent
   bradycardia [**12-22**] beta blockers.
   -start dilt 30 PO QID ([**11-21**] daily home dose)
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Will consider restarting next week if patient stable,
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA). EKG
   without ischemic changes and CE flat yesterday.
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   .
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension:
   - cont Coreg
   -start diltiazem as above
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
Impression: 82 year old female with a history of coronary artery
   disease s/p CABG, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation and
   COPD on home oxygen who presented to OSH on [**2154-11-4**] with hypotension,
   bradycardia and hypercarbic respiratory failure transferred here [**11-9**]
   for management of gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -Steroid 40 PO BID today, then 20 PO BID tomorrow
   continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - Vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] day 5 (of 8) for empiric coverate of nosomial pna
   - sputum cx pending
   For Cardiac optimization:
   -Increase Coreg to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   -Lasix Diuresis for net -1L
   -transfuse 1unit PRBCs for HCT >25 given evidence of end organ ischemia
   (cardiac)
   -possible to extubate patient on IV nitro to prevent pulmonary flash
   edema.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Back to baseline Cr of 1.0, with good UOP.
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN.
   .
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable.  No EGD only evidence for GI
   bleed is guaiac positive stool on admission.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25 (t
fuse one unit today as above)
   - PO PPI daily
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count increasing from nadir of 56. Now
   105.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - holding heparin products
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
    .
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient tachycardic overnight, but with recent
   bradycardia [**12-22**] beta blockers.
   -start dilt 30 PO QID ([**11-21**] daily home dose)
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Will consider restarting next week if patient stable,
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA). EKG
   without ischemic changes and CE flat yesterday.
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   .
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension:
   - cont Coreg
   -start diltiazem as above
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **].
   - Silvadene 1% cream to coccyx [**Hospital1 **]
   - wound care consulted

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. She was admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure and was transferred from the outside hospital (OSH) for management of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been intubated and ventilated, and has been receiving various medications to manage her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if her COPD is not well-controlled, or if she develops pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may continue or worsen if not properly managed, leading to anemia, hypovolemic shock, or other complications.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed properly, leading to end-stage renal disease.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to bleeding complications or platelet transfusions.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if not properly managed, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, or heart failure.
6. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's coronary artery disease may worsen if not properly managed, leading to myocardial infarction, heart failure, or death.
7. Infection: The patient may develop infections such as pneumonia, sepsis, or urinary tract infections, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
8. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's nutritional deficiencies may worsen if not properly managed, leading to malnutrition, weakness, or other complications.
9. Wound Complications: The patient's wound on her back may become infected or develop complications such as cellulitis, abscesses, or necrotizing fasciitis.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions to prevent complications and improve her outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU for management of hypercarbic respiratory failure and gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 135/54 mmHg. Her respiratory status is improving, with a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 160 mmHg and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7-9.7 x 10^9/L, a hemoglobin level of 10.0-12.5 g/dL, and a platelet count of 113-106 x 10^9/L. Her liver function tests are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 43 IU/L. Her electrolyte levels are also within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level of 3.5 mmol/L.

The patient's medications include carvedilol, diltiazem, prednisone, simvastatin, and furosemide. She is also receiving insulin sliding scale for glycemic control and midazolam and fentanyl for sedation.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she may still be at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying COPD and atrial fibrillation.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and she may still be at risk for further bleeding due to her underlying conditions.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of antibiotic use, and she may still be at risk for infection due to her underlying conditions and the use of antibiotics.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and she may still be at risk for cardiac arrhythmias due to her underlying conditions.
5. Kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, and she may still be at risk for kidney injury due to her underlying conditions and the use of antibiotics.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she still requires close monitoring and management of her underlying conditions to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABB and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD. Quite
   alkalotic on ABG today, likely contraction alkalosis from overdiuresis.
   For COPD:
   -Steroid 40 PO BID today, then 20 PO BID tomorrow
   continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - Vanco (today is last day) /[**Last Name (un) **] day 7 (of 8) for empiric coverate of
   nosomial pna
   - sputum cx pending
   For Cardiac optimization:
   -cont Coreg to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   - decreased dilt to 15 QID
   -Diamox Diuresis for net -1L
   -if  extubatable, use IV nitro to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Back to baseline Cr of 1.0, with good UOP.
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN.  No ACEI for now
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT dwindling down w/ inc to 28 after 1 U
   PRBCs yesterday.   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive
   stool on admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large
   ecchymosis surrounding L upper leg.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25 (t
fuse one unit today as above)
   - PO PPI daily
   - rpt PM Hct w/ Abd CT to assess for RP bleed if continues to decrease.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count increasing from nadir of 56. Now
   105.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - no heparin given hx of GI bleed
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient tachycardic overnight, but with recent
   bradycardia [**12-22**] beta blockers.
   - [**Month (only) 38**] dilt to 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Will consider restarting next week if patient stable,
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA). EKG
   without ischemic changes and CE flat yesterday.
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABB and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD. Quite
   alkalotic on ABG today, likely contraction alkalosis from overdiuresis.
   For COPD:
   -Steroid 40 PO BID today, then 20 PO BID tomorrow
   continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - Vanco (today is last day) /[**Last Name (un) **] day 7 (of 8) for empiric coverate of
   nosomial pna
   - sputum cx pending
   For Cardiac optimization:
   -cont Coreg to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   - decreased dilt to 15 QID
   -Diamox Diuresis for net -1L
   -if  extubatable, use IV nitro to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Back to baseline Cr of 1.0, with good UOP.
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN.  No ACEI for now
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT dwindling down w/ inc to 28 after 1 U
   PRBCs yesterday.   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive
   stool on admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large
   ecchymosis surrounding L upper leg.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25 (t
fuse one unit today as above)
   - PO PPI daily
   - rpt PM Hct w/ Abd CT to assess for RP bleed if continues to decrease.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count increasing from nadir of 56. Now
   105.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - no heparin given hx of GI bleed
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient tachycardic overnight, but with recent
   bradycardia [**12-22**] beta blockers.
   - [**Month (only) 38**] dilt to 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Will consider restarting next week if patient stable,
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA). EKG
   without ischemic changes and CE flat yesterday.
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - no ASA given GI bleed.
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the hospital for management of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a complex medical history, including previous episodes of respiratory failure, cardiac issues, and bleeding complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern, with a recent episode of respiratory failure requiring reintubation. The patient's COPD and cardiac issues may continue to exacerbate her respiratory status.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is back to baseline, but her urine output is still a concern. Further monitoring is necessary to assess for any signs of acute kidney injury.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's HCT is decreasing, and further transfusions may be necessary to maintain a safe level. The patient's large ecchymosis surrounding her left upper leg is a concern and may require further evaluation.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is increasing, but further monitoring is necessary to assess for any signs of bleeding or platelet dysfunction.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's tachycardia and bradycardia may require further management, including adjustments to her beta blocker and anticoagulation therapy.
6. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's CAD and previous CABG may continue to pose a risk for cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Aortic Valve Replacement: The patient's bioprosthetic AVR may require further evaluation and management to ensure optimal function and prevent complications.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may require further management, including adjustments to her beta blocker and diuretic therapy.
9. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may require further management, including adjustments to her statin therapy.

Overall, the patient's complex medical history and current condition require close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and ensure optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
Impression: 82 year old female with a history of coronary artery
   disease s/p CABG, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation and
   COPD on home oxygen who presented to OSH on [**2154-11-4**] with hypotension,
   bradycardia and hypercarbic respiratory failure transferred here [**11-9**]
   for management of gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -Steroid 40 PO BID today, then 20 PO BID tomorrow
   continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - Vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] day 5 (of 8) for empiric coverate of nosomial pna
   - sputum cx pending
   For Cardiac optimization:
   -Increase Coreg to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   -Lasix Diuresis for net -1L
   -transfuse 1unit PRBCs for HCT >25 given evidence of end organ ischemia
   (cardiac)
   -possible to extubate patient on IV nitro to prevent pulmonary flash
   edema.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Back to baseline Cr of 1.0, with good UOP.
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN.
   .
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable.  No EGD only evidence for GI
   bleed is guaiac positive stool on admission.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25 (t
fuse one unit today as above)
   - PO PPI daily
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count increasing from nadir of 56. Now
   105.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - holding heparin products
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
    .
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient tachycardic overnight, but with recent
   bradycardia [**12-22**] beta blockers.
   -start dilt 30 PO QID ([**11-21**] daily home dose)
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Will consider restarting next week if patient stable,
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA). EKG
   without ischemic changes and CE flat yesterday.
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   .
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension:

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Hypercarbic respiratory failure: likely multifactorial, with possible causes including pneumonia, cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia, and underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema), and COPD.
* Acute renal failure: back to baseline creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, with good urine output, thought to be due to acute tubular necrosis.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: guaiac-positive stool on admission, with active bleeding and transfusion goal of >25%.
* Thrombocytopenia: unclear etiology, with platelet count increasing from nadir of 56 to 105 K/uL.
* Atrial fibrillation: patient tachycardic overnight, with recent bradycardia, and on beta blockers.
* Coronary artery disease: s/p CABG, with EKG without ischemic changes and CE flat yesterday.
* Aortic valve replacement: bioprosthetic, not anticoagulated.
* Hypertension: controlled with Coreg and diltiazem.
* Hyperlipidemia: managed with simvastatin.

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABB and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD. Quite
   alkalotic on ABG today, likely contraction alkalosis from overdiuresis.
   For COPD:
   -Steroid 40 PO BID today, then 20 PO BID tomorrow
   continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - Vanco (today is last day) /[**Last Name (un) **] day 7 (of 8) for empiric coverate of
   nosomial pna
   - sputum cx pending
   For Cardiac optimization:
   -cont Coreg to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   - decreased dilt to 15 QID
   -Diamox Diuresis for net -1L
   -if  extubatable, use IV nitro to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Back to baseline Cr of 1.0, with good UOP.
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN.  No ACEI for now
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT dwindling down w/ inc to 28 after 1 U
   PRBCs yesterday.   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive
   stool on admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large
   ecchymosis surrounding L upper leg.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25 (t
fuse one unit today as above)
   - PO PPI daily
   - rpt PM Hct w/ Abd CT to assess for RP bleed if continues to decrease.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count increasing from nadir of 56. Now
   105.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - no heparin given hx of GI bleed
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient tachycardic overnight, but with recent
   bradycardia [**12-22**] beta blockers.
   - [**Month (only) 38**] dilt to 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Will consider restarting next week if patient stable,
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA). EKG
   without ischemic changes and CE flat yesterday.
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - no ASA given GI bleed.
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension:
   - cont Coreg
   -start diltiazem as above
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **].
   - Silvadene 1% cream to coccyx [**Hospital1 **]
   - wound care consulted

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented to the emergency department with hypercarbic respiratory failure and gastrointestinal bleeding. She was initially extubated but required reintubation due to respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's condition is complicated by the presence of pneumonia, hypertension, and cardiac failure, which may be contributing to the development of flash pulmonary edema. She has also been diagnosed with a stage II ulcer on her back from a burn injury.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 141/51 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 99%. Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, but her platelet count is increasing from a nadir of 56.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Steroids for COPD
* Vancomycin for pneumonia
* Coreg for cardiac optimization
* Diltiazem for hypertension
* Diamox diuresis for fluid management
* Active type and screen for gastrointestinal bleeding
* Platelet transfusion for thrombocytopenia
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory arrest or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may continue or worsen, leading to anemia, hypovolemic shock, or even death.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to bleeding complications or require platelet transfusions.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or stroke.
6. Cardiac failure: The patient's cardiac failure may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest, heart failure, or even death.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to sepsis, respiratory failure, or even death.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen, leading to cardiac failure, stroke, or even death.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -Steroid Pred 20 PO daily today
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - Vanco (today is last day) /[**Last Name (un) **] day 7 (of 8) for empiric coverate of
   nosomial pna
   - sputum cx pending
   For Cardiac optimization:
   -cont Coreg to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   - decreased dilt to 15 QID
   -Diamox Diuresis for net -1L
   -if  extubatable, use IV nitro to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Back to baseline Cr of 1.0, with good UOP.
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN.  No ACEI for now
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT dwindling down w/ inc to 28 after 1 U
   PRBCs yesterday.   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive
   stool on admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large
   ecchymosis surrounding L upper leg.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25 (t
fuse one unit today as above)
   - PO PPI daily
   - rpt PM Hct w/ Abd CT to assess for RP bleed if continues to decrease.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count increasing from nadir of 56. Now
   105.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - no heparin given hx of GI bleed
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient tachycardic overnight, but with recent
   bradycardia [**12-22**] beta blockers.
   - [**Month (only) 38**] dilt to 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Will consider restarting next week if patient stable,
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA). EKG
   without ischemic changes and CE flat yesterday.
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - no ASA given GI bleed.
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension:
   - cont Coreg
   -start diltiazem as above
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **].
   - Silvadene 1% cream to coccyx [**Hospital1 **]
   - wound care consulted

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 60 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 209 mmHg.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 94 beats per minute (bpm). Her blood pressure is 141/51 mmHg, and her cardiac rhythm is irregular.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a gastrointestinal bleed, which is likely related to her COPD and possibly also caused by her atrial fibrillation. She has received a total of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and has a hematocrit (Hct) of 28.3%.
* Renal: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI), which is thought to be secondary to her hypovolemia and may also be related to her atrial fibrillation. Her serum creatinine (Cr) level is 1.0 mg/dL, and her urine output (UOP) is 200 mL over the past 24 hours.
* Hematological: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is thought to be secondary to her Zosyn use. Her platelet count is increasing, and she is being monitored closely for bleeding.

The patient's current medications include:

* Vancomycin for empiric coverage of nosocomial pneumonia
* Meropenem for empiric coverage of nosocomial pneumonia
* Lansoprazole (Prevacid) for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Simvastatin for hyperlipidemia
* Metoprolol (Coreg) for hypertension and heart failure
* Diltiazem for atrial fibrillation and hypertension
* Diamox for diuresis
* Fibersource HN (Full) for nutrition
* Regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control
* Silvadene 1% cream for wound care

The patient's current plan is to continue her medications, including her antibiotics, antihypertensives, and anticoagulants. She will also continue to receive mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy. Her atrial fibrillation will be managed with rate control medications, and her hypercarbic respiratory failure will be managed with diuresis and possibly also with mechanical ventilation.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen if she is not extubated and managed properly.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to cardiac complications, such as heart failure or stroke.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed may worsen if she is not managed properly.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen if she is not managed properly.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen if she is not managed properly.

Overall, the patient's current status is complex, and she requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -Steroid Pred 20 PO daily today
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - Vanco finished /[**Last Name (un) **] day 8 (of 8) for empiric coverate of nosomial

   - sputum cx [**11-12**] no growth
   For Cardiac optimization:
   -incr Coreg to 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - dilt to 15 QID
   -Diamox x1 for diuresis today
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Back to baseline Cr of 0.9 today, with good UOP.
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN.  No ACEI for now
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable today at 28.   No EGD only
   evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on admission. No scope
   indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding L upper leg.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping. DIC labs tomorrow am.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count once again trending down at 73
   today. PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - no heparin given hx of GI bleed
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled
   - dilt 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. Her respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 99%.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is currently rate-controlled with diltiazem. Her blood pressure is 141/51 mmHg, and her heart rate is 94 beats per minute.
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which is currently being managed with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and transfusions. Her hematocrit is stable at 28.3%.
* Renal status: The patient has acute renal failure, which is thought to be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Her creatinine is 0.9 mg/dL, and her urine output is adequate.
* Hematological status: The patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 73 x 10^9/L. The etiology of this condition is unclear, but it is thought to be secondary to Zosyn.
* Infectious status: The patient has a history of pneumonia, which was treated with vancomycin and meropenem. Her sputum culture is negative, and she is currently receiving empiric coverage for nosocomial pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but she is at risk for further respiratory failure due to her underlying COPD and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which is currently being managed with PPIs and transfusions. She is at risk for further bleeding due to her thrombocytopenia and underlying gastrointestinal disease.
* Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is thought to be due to ATN. She is at risk for further kidney damage due to her underlying cardiovascular disease and hypertension.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is thought to be secondary to Zosyn. She is at risk for further bleeding due to her low platelet count.
* Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia, which was treated with antibiotics. She is at risk for further infection due to her underlying immunosuppression and presence of central lines.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Respiratory support: The patient will continue to receive mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy as needed.
* Gastrointestinal management: The patient will continue to receive PPIs and transfusions as needed.
* Renal management: The patient will continue to receive fluid management and electrolyte replacement as needed.
* Hematological management: The patient will continue to receive platelet transfusions as needed.
* Infectious management: The patient will continue to receive empiric coverage for nosocomial pneumonia.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions, including respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and infection. She requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve her clinical outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -Continue steroids at prednisone 20 mg PO daily, taper tomorrow to 10
   mg PO daily
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - completed 8 day course of Vancomycin and meropenem
   - sputum cx [**11-12**] no growth
   For Cardiac optimization: Improved BP control. Metabolic alkalosis
   improved with IV diamox, and did have some diuresis with it earlier in
   the day.
   - cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - diltiazem to 15 QID
   - additional dose of diamox today. Goal -500 to -1 L negative.
   Ventilation:
   - Repeat VBG with SBT today and extubation if passes SBT.
   - IV nitroglycerin during extubation to prevent flash pulmonary edema
   with removal of PPV.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Cre stable at 0.9. Consider starting ACEI once
   extubated and hemodynamically stable.
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable at 28 x3 days.   No EGD only
   evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on admission. No scope
   indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding L upper leg.
   DIC labs negative.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping.
   - consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) if Hct remains
   stable.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Possible antibiotics related. Stable in 70s.  PF4
   antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - consider restarting anticoagulation for AF.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled  and hemodynamically
   stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed, but has been
   stable in Hct x3 days.
   - diltiazem 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider restarting coumadin tomorrow.
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - consider restarting ASA
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension: improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to
   150s-160s.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -Continue steroids at prednisone 20 mg PO daily, taper tomorrow to 10
   mg PO daily
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - completed 8 day course of Vancomycin and meropenem
   - sputum cx [**11-12**] no growth
   For Cardiac optimization: Improved BP control. Metabolic alkalosis

   Disposition: in ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure requiring intubation.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including trial of extubation, which was unsuccessful due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and medications for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and COPD.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is currently rate-controlled. Her blood pressure is stable, with a systolic blood pressure of 128 mmHg.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. She is receiving fluids and diuretics to manage her fluid status.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which is currently being managed with proton pump inhibitors and transfusions.
* Hematological: The patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 70 x 10^9/L. She is receiving platelet transfusions and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure can worsen if not managed properly.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypertension can increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can worsen if not managed properly.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding can increase the risk of further bleeding if not managed properly.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can increase the risk of bleeding if not managed properly.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can increase the risk of stroke and other cardiovascular complications if not managed properly.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued mechanical ventilation and respiratory support
* Management of atrial fibrillation with rate control and anticoagulation therapy
* Management of acute renal failure with fluids and diuretics
* Management of gastrointestinal bleeding with proton pump inhibitors and transfusions
* Management of thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions and anticoagulation therapy
* Family meetings to discuss progress and code status

The patient's disposition is currently in the ICU, and her code status is do not resuscitate (DNR)."

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -Continue steroids at 20 mg PO daily, taper tomorrow to 10 mg PO daily
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -Continue steroids at 20 mg PO daily, taper tomorrow to 10 mg PO daily
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - completed 8 day course of Vancomycin and meropenem
   - sputum cx [**11-12**] no growth
   For Cardiac optimization: Improved BP control. Metabolic alkalosis
   improved with IV diamox, and did have some diuresis with it earlier in
   the day.
   - cont Coreg to 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - dilt to 15 QID
   - additional dose of diamox today.
   Ventilation:
   - Repeat VBG with SBT today and extubation if passes SBT.
   - IV nitroglycerin during extubation to prevent flash pulmonary edema
   with removal of PPV.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Cre stable at 0.9. Consider starting ACEI once
   extubated and hemodynamically stable.
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable at 28 x3 days.   No EGD only
   evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on admission. No scope
   indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding L upper leg.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping. DIC labs tomorrow am.
   - consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) if Hct remains
   stable.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Possible antibiotics related. Stable in 70s.  PF4
   antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - consider anticoagulation.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled
   - dilt 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider restarting coumadin tomorrow.
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - no ASA given GI bleed.
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension:
   - cont Coreg

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure requiring intubation. She has been on mechanical ventilation for several days and has been experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has also been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, and has been treated with antibiotics and anticoagulants. Her platelet count has been low, and she has been transfused with platelets. The patient's electrolyte levels have been abnormal, and she has been treated with diuretics and electrolyte replacement.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not managed properly.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is a significant concern, and there is a risk of further bleeding if not managed properly.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count is a concern, and there is a risk of further bleeding if not managed properly.
4. Hypercarbic acidosis: The patient's hypercarbic acidosis is a concern, and there is a risk of further acidosis if not managed properly.
5. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis is a concern, and there is a risk of further alkalosis if not managed properly.
6. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury is a concern, and there is a risk of further kidney damage if not managed properly.
7. Infection: The patient's infection is a concern, and there is a risk of further infection if not managed properly.
8. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac complications are a concern, and there is a risk of further cardiac complications if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding with antibiotics and anticoagulants.
3. Monitor the patient's platelet count and transfuse if necessary.
4. Continue to manage the patient's electrolyte levels with diuretics and electrolyte replacement.
5. Monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust fluid management as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's infection and adjust antibiotics as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust medication as needed.
8. Consider further testing to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are identified:

**Summary:**

The patient, an 82-year-old female with a history of CAD, AF, and COPD, was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has been stable on [**Name (NI) 7214**] and has had increases in coreg to 25 mg. The patient has persistently been hypernatremic, requiring increased free water flushes. The patient's wound care has been re-evaluated, and acetazolamide was administered with a subsequent decrease in bicarbonate levels. The patient's respiratory support remains unchanged, with a CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory failure persists, with a RSBI of 30 and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 203. The patient's ventilator settings need to be closely monitored to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. **Hypernatremia:** The patient's persistent hypernatremia (149-147 mmol/L) may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potential neurological complications. Further monitoring and management of sodium levels are necessary.
3. **Impaired Skin Integrity:** The patient's burn on the backside requires ongoing wound care and management to prevent further complications.
4. **Gastrointestinal Bleeding:** The patient's gastrointestinal bleed may require further evaluation and management to prevent re-bleeding and potential complications.
5. **Atrial Fibrillation:** The patient's atrial fibrillation may require further management to prevent complications, such as stroke or thromboembolism.
6. **Electrolyte Imbalances:** The patient's electrolyte imbalances, including hypernatremia and hypokalemia, may require further management to prevent potential complications.
7. **Infection:** The patient's ICU stay and respiratory support increase the risk of infection. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to detect potential infections early.
8. **Fluid Overload:** The patient's fluid balance remains positive, with a total fluid intake of 2,372 mL and a total output of 1,180 mL. Close monitoring of the patient's fluid status is necessary to prevent fluid overload.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their respiratory, electrolyte, and fluid status to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -Steroid Pred 20 PO daily today
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - Vanco finished /[**Last Name (un) **] day 8 (of 8) for empiric coverate of nosomial
   pna
   - sputum cx [**11-12**] no growth
   For Cardiac optimization:
   -incr Coreg to 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - dilt to 15 QID
   -Diamox x1 for diuresis today
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Back to baseline Cr of 0.9 today, with good UOP.
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN.  No ACEI for now
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable today at 28.   No EGD only
   evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on admission. No scope
   indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding L upper leg.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping. DIC labs tomorrow am.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count once again trending down at 73
   today. PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - no heparin given hx of GI bleed
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled
   - dilt 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Will consider restarting next week if patient stable,
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - no ASA given GI bleed.
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension:
   - cont Coreg

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -Steroid Pred 20 PO daily today
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - Vanco finished /[**Last Name (un) **] day 8 (of 8) for empiric coverate of nosomial
   pna
   - sputum cx [**11-12**] no growth
   For Cardiac optimization:
   -incr Coreg to 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - dilt to 15 QID
   -Diamox x1 for diuresis today
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Back to baseline Cr of 0.9 today, with good UOP.
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN.  No ACEI for now
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable today at 28.   No EGD only
   evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on admission. No scope
   indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding L upper leg.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping. DIC labs tomorrow am.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count once again trending down at 73
   today. PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - no heparin given hx of GI bleed
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled
   - dilt 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Will consider restarting next week if patient stable,
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - no ASA given GI bleed.
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension:
   - cont Coreg
   -cont dilt for now
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **].
   - Silvadene 1% cream to coccyx [**Hospital1 **]
   - wound care consulted

   Disposition: in ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a recent aortic valve replacement. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure and was initially intubated.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
* Heart rate: 84 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 128/50 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 73,000/μL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Sodium: 147 mmol/L
* Potassium: 4.8 mmol/L
* Glucose: 193 mg/dL

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including:

* Hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial and may be related to pneumonia, cardiac disease, and COPD.
* Acute renal failure, which is thought to be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
* Gastrointestinal bleeding, which is guaiac-positive and may be related to a large ecchymosis surrounding the left upper leg.
* Thrombocytopenia, which is unclear in etiology but may be related to Zosyn or other medications.
* Atrial fibrillation, which is currently rate-controlled.

The patient is receiving several medications, including:

* Coreg (carvedilol) for hypertension and cardiac optimization
* Diltiazem for hypertension and cardiac optimization
* Prednisone for COPD
* Vancomycin for empiric coverage of nosocomial pneumonia
* Silver sulfadiazene cream for wound care
* Simvastatin for hyperlipidemia

The patient's ICU care includes:

* Fibersource HN (Full) for nutrition
* Regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control
* PICC line for central venous access
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and her disposition is in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to continued hypercarbic respiratory failure or development of pneumonia
* Acute kidney injury due to ongoing ATN or other nephrotoxic medications
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to ongoing bleeding or development of new bleeding sites
* Thrombocytopenia due to ongoing platelet destruction or development of new platelet disorders
* Cardiac complications due to ongoing atrial fibrillation or development of new cardiac arrhythmias
* Wound infections due to ongoing wound care or development of new wound infections
* Septicemia due to ongoing infection or development of new infections."

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -Continue steroids at 20 mg PO daily, taper tomorrow to 10 mg PO daily
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - completed 8 day course of Vancomycin and meropenem
   - sputum cx [**11-12**] no growth
   For Cardiac optimization: Improved BP control. Metabolic alkalosis
   improved with IV diamox, and did have some diuresis with it earlier in
   the day.
   - cont Coreg to 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - dilt to 15 QID
   - additional dose of diamox today.
   - Repeat VBG with SBT today and extubation if passes SBT.
   - IV nitroglycerin during extubation to prevent flash pulmonary edema
   with removal of PPV.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Back to baseline Cr of 0.9 today, with good UOP.
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN.  No ACEI for now
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable today at 28.   No EGD only
   evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on admission. No scope
   indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding L upper leg.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping. DIC labs tomorrow am.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count once again trending down at 73
   today. PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - no heparin given hx of GI bleed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: in ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a recent aortic valve replacement. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of hypercarbic respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and acute kidney injury.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is rate-controlled with diltiazem. Her blood pressure is 128/50 mmHg, and her heart rate is 84 beats per minute.
* Renal: The patient has acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and a urine output of 1.180 mL.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has gastrointestinal bleeding, with a hematocrit level of 26.6%. She has a large ecchymosis surrounding her left upper leg and is receiving transfusions to maintain a hematocrit level above 25%.
* Hematological: The patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 73,000/μL. The etiology of thrombocytopenia is unclear, but it is thought to be secondary to Zosyn.
* Neurological: The patient's neurological status is not well-documented in the progress note.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying COPD, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury can progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can increase the risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can lead to stroke, heart failure, and other cardiovascular complications if not managed appropriately.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her underlying medical conditions and the need for mechanical ventilation and antibiotics.
7. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to her underlying medical conditions and the need for antibiotics.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.
2. Antibiotics for gastrointestinal bleeding and potential sepsis.
3. Transfusions to maintain a hematocrit level above 25%.
4. Platelet transfusions for thrombocytopenia.
5. Management of atrial fibrillation with diltiazem and rate control.
6. Monitoring for signs of respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and acute kidney injury.
7. Close monitoring of the patient's neurological status.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex medical case with multiple underlying conditions, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, COPD, and a recent aortic valve replacement. She is at risk for various medical complications, including respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute kidney injury, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, infection, and sepsis. The patient's treatment plan should focus on managing these underlying conditions and preventing complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 82 yo F with CAD s/p CABG, AF, known COPD on home
   oxygen admitted from OSH for management of GI bleed, currently in
   hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring re-intubation yesterday.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Need to discuss restarting warfarin for AF (HCT been stable x3 days)
   - Patient was extubated and then had post-extubation ABG of 7.25/95/86,
   was then intubated once again.
   - Family discussion revealed that they feel patient would want to
   remain DNR/DNI; however, want to proceed with tracheostomy and PEG tube
   placement
   - Patient had cumulative fluid balance of -80 mL in 20 hours in the
   evening and thus further diuresis was not pursued
   - PM lytes and HCT were stable with slight decrease in sodium to 146
   and no change in creatinine follow diuresis during the day
   - AM CXR revealed that PICC line tip likely in azygous

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CAD, s/p CABG, AF, and known COPD, admitted to the ICU for management of a GI bleed. She is currently in hypercarbic respiratory failure and requires re-intubation. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, and blood pressure of 119/50 mmHg. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 35%. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.25, pCO2 of 95 mmHg, and pO2 of 86 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she requires re-intubation. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration, and close monitoring of her respiratory function is necessary.
2. GI bleed: The patient has a history of GI bleed, and there is a risk of further bleeding, particularly with the use of anticoagulant therapy.
3. AF: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which may increase her risk of stroke and thromboembolism. Anticoagulant therapy may be necessary to prevent these complications.
4. COPD: The patient has known COPD, which may worsen her respiratory status and increase her risk of respiratory failure.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may increase her risk of skin breakdown and infection.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly with the use of invasive devices such as central lines and endotracheal tubes.
7. Thrombosis: The patient is at risk of developing thrombosis, particularly with the use of anticoagulant therapy.
8. Renal insufficiency: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration, particularly with the use of nephrotoxic medications.
9. Metabolic complications: The patient is at risk of developing metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia and electrolyte imbalances, particularly with the use of insulin and other medications.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is unstable, and close monitoring of her respiratory, cardiovascular, and GI function is necessary. Anticoagulant therapy may be necessary to prevent thromboembolism, and further evaluation of her GI bleed is necessary to determine the cause and appropriate management. The patient's DNR/DNI status should be respected, and her family should be involved in the decision-making process. Further evaluation of her skin integrity and potential skin breakdown is necessary, and measures should be taken to prevent infection and promote wound healing."

   - Patient was extubated and then had post-extubation ABG of 7.25/95/86,
   was then intubated once again.
   - Family discussion revealed that they feel patient would want to
   remain DNR/DNI; however, want to proceed with tracheostomy and PEG tube
   placement
   - Patient had cumulative fluid balance of -80 mL in 20 hours in the
   evening and thus further diuresis was not pursued
   - PM lytes and HCT were stable with slight decrease in sodium to 146
   and no change in creatinine follow diuresis during the day
   - AM CXR revealed that PICC line tip likely in azygous
   - Evening CXR showed that PICC line tip back in SVC following power
   flush

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**],
   patient became progressively hypercarbic and required intubation.
   Likely multifactorial; both infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac
   (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary
   edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -taper prednisone to 10 mg PO daily
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA: No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no fevers.
   Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   For Cardiac optimization: Improved BP control on carvedilol. Metabolic
   alkalosis improved with IV diamox, and did have some diuresis with it
   earlier in the day.
   - cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - diltiazem to 15 QID
   - runs even today
   Ventilation:
   - VBG today shows appropriate ventilation (slightly alkalotic) .
   Continue current vent settings
   - NPO after MN for trach and PEG by IP in AM
    Acute Renal Failure: Cre stable at 0.9. Consider starting ACEI once
   extubated and hemodynamically stable.
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable at 28 x3 days.   Hct down to 26,
   stable on rpt, likely due to some oozing from PICC site repositioning.
   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on
   admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis
   surrounding L upper leg. DIC labs negative.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping.
   - consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) if Hct remains
   stable.
   - check B12, folate iron studies
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Possible antibiotics related. Stable in 70s.  PF4
   antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies include infection,
   although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled  and hemodynamically
   stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed, but has been
   stable in Hct x3 days.
   - diltiazem 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider restarting coumadin after procedures.
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - consider restarting ASA
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension: improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to
   150s-160s.
   -cont Coreg at 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   -cont dilt for now
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**],
   patient became progressively hypercarbic and required intubation.
   Likely multifactorial; both infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac
   (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary
   edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -taper prednisone to 10 mg PO daily
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA: No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no fevers.
   Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   For Cardiac optimization: Improved BP control on carvedilol. Metabolic
   alkalosis improved with IV diamox, and did have some diuresis with it
   earlier in the day.

   dropping.
   - consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) if Hct remains
   stable.
   - check B12, folate iron studies
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Possible antibiotics related. Stable in 70s.  PF4
   antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies include infection,
   although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled  and hemodynamically
   stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed, but has been
   stable in Hct x3 days.
   - diltiazem 15 [**Hospital1 **]

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD) with a previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen.

The patient was admitted from an outside hospital for management of a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and hypercarbic respiratory failure, requiring re-intubation. She has a history of failed extubation attempts, and her respiratory status remains unstable.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35% and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is stable at 0.9 mg/dL, and she is at risk for acute renal failure.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a stable hemoglobin level (HCT) of 28% for three days, and she is at risk for further bleeding.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is stable in the 70s, and she is at risk for bleeding.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's AF is rate-controlled and hemodynamically stable, but she is not anticoagulated due to her GI bleed.

The patient's medical complications and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and she is at risk for further respiratory failure.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is stable, but she is at risk for further acute kidney injury.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk for further bleeding, and she may require transfusion.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is stable, but she is at risk for bleeding.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's AF is rate-controlled, but she is at risk for stroke and systemic embolism if not anticoagulated.
6. Coronary artery disease: The patient's CAD is a risk factor for cardiac events, including myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest.
7. Aortic valve replacement: The patient's AVR is a risk factor for cardiac events, including valve failure and cardiac arrest.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Ventilation: The patient will continue to receive mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 35% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.
2. Fluid management: The patient will receive diuresis to manage her fluid balance.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient will receive transfusion and monitoring for further bleeding.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient will receive transfusion and monitoring for further bleeding.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient will receive anticoagulation once her GI bleed is managed.
6. Coronary artery disease: The patient will receive medical management to manage her CAD.
7. Aortic valve replacement: The patient will receive medical management to manage her AVR.

The patient's code status is DNR, and her disposition is to remain in the ICU for further management and monitoring."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint: 82 yo F with CAD s/p CABG, AF, known COPD on home
   oxygen admitted from OSH for management of GI bleed, currently in
   hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring re-intubation yesterday.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Need to discuss restarting warfarin for AF (HCT been stable x3 days)
   - Patient was extubated and then had post-extubation ABG of 7.25/95/86,
   was then intubated once again.
   - Family discussion revealed that they feel patient would want to
   remain DNR/DNI; however, want to proceed with tracheostomy and PEG tube
   placement
   - Patient had cumulative fluid balance of -80 mL in 20 hours in the
   evening and thus further diuresis was not pursued
   - PM lytes and HCT were stable with slight decrease in sodium to 146
   and no change in creatinine follow diuresis during the day
   - AM CXR revealed that PICC line tip likely in azygous
   - Evening CXR showed that PICC line tip back in SVC following power

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -Continue steroids at prednisone 20 mg PO daily, taper tomorrow to 10
   mg PO daily
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - completed 8 day course of Vancomycin and meropenem
   - sputum cx [**11-12**] no growth
   For Cardiac optimization: Improved BP control. Metabolic alkalosis
   improved with IV diamox, and did have some diuresis with it earlier in
   the day.
   - cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - diltiazem to 15 QID
   - additional dose of diamox today. Goal -500 to -1 L negative.
   Ventilation:
   - Repeat VBG with SBT today and extubation if passes SBT.
   - IV nitroglycerin during extubation to prevent flash pulmonary edema
   with removal of PPV.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Cre stable at 0.9. Consider starting ACEI once
   extubated and hemodynamically stable.
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable at 28 x3 days.   No EGD only
   evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on admission. No scope
   indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding L upper leg.
   DIC labs negative.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping.
   - consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) if Hct remains
   stable.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Possible antibiotics related. Stable in 70s.  PF4
   antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - consider restarting anticoagulation for AF.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled  and hemodynamically
   stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed, but has been
   stable in Hct x3 days.
   - diltiazem 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider restarting coumadin tomorrow.
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - consider restarting ASA
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension: improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to
   150s-160s.
   -cont Coreg
   -cont dilt for now
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on 35% FiO2. Her ABG results show pH 7.25, pCO2 95 mmHg, and pO2 246 mmHg.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has atrial fibrillation and is currently rate-controlled. Her blood pressure is stable, and her cardiac enzymes are within normal limits.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a gastrointestinal bleed, which is being managed with proton pump inhibitors and transfusions. Her hemoglobin level is stable at 28%.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine level is stable at 0.9 mg/dL, and her urine output is adequate.
* Neurological: The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed may continue to bleed, leading to further anemia and potential need for transfusions.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level may rise, leading to acute kidney injury.
* Neurological complications: The patient's sedation may lead to prolonged sedation or respiratory depression.

The plan of care includes:

* Continue mechanical ventilation and monitor the patient's respiratory status.
* Continue transfusions and monitor the patient's hemoglobin level.
* Monitor the patient's cardiac status and manage atrial fibrillation with rate control.
* Monitor the patient's renal function and urine output.
* Continue sedation and monitor the patient's neurological status.
* Consider restarting anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation if the patient's hemoglobin level remains stable.
* Consider restarting warfarin for atrial fibrillation if the patient's hemoglobin level remains stable.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical issues, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**],
   patient became progressively hypercarbic and required intubation.
   Likely multifactorial; both infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac
   (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary
   edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -taper prednisone to 10 mg PO daily
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA: No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no fevers.
   Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   For Cardiac optimization: Improved BP control on carvedilol. Metabolic
   alkalosis improved with IV diamox, and did have some diuresis with it
   earlier in the day.
   - cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - diltiazem to 15 QID
   - runs even today
   Ventilation:
   - VBG shows appropriate ventilation. Continue current vent settings
   - NPO after MN for trach and PEG by IP in AM
   Acute Renal Failure: Cre stable at 0.9. Consider starting ACEI once
   extubated and hemodynamically stable.
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable at 28 x3 days.   Hct down to 26,
   stable on rpt, likely due to some oozing from PICC site repositioning.
   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on
   admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis
   surrounding L upper leg. DIC labs negative.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping.
   - consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) if Hct remains
   stable.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Possible antibiotics related. Stable in 70s.  PF4
   antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - consider restarting anticoagulation for AF.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled  and hemodynamically
   stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed, but has been
   stable in Hct x3 days.
   - diltiazem 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider restarting coumadin tomorrow.
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - consider restarting ASA
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension: improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint: 82 yo F with CAD s/p CABG, AF, known COPD on home
   oxygen admitted from OSH for management of GI bleed, currently in
   hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring re-intubation yesterday.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Need to discuss restarting warfarin for AF (HCT been stable x3 days)
   - Patient was extubated and then had post-extubation ABG of 7.25/95/86,
   was then intubated once again.
   - Family discussion revealed that they feel patient would want to
   remain DNR/DNI; however, want to proceed with tracheostomy and PEG tube
   placement
   - Patient had cumulative fluid balance of -80 mL in 20 hours in the
   evening and thus further diuresis was not pursued
   - PM lytes and HCT were stable with slight decrease in sodium to 146
   and no change in creatinine follow diuresis during the day
   - AM CXR revealed that PICC line tip likely in azygous
   - Evening CXR showed that PICC line tip back in SVC following power
   flush
   - Radiology rec abdominal ultrasound to rule out AAA given calcific
   aorta on CXR, not yet ordered

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, and there is a high risk of re-intubation if not properly managed.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleed, and the current HCT is stable, but there is a risk of further bleeding, especially with the presence of a large ecchymosis surrounding the left upper leg.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are stable, but there is a risk of developing acute renal failure due to inadequate fluid management and the presence of hypercarbic respiratory failure.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, and the current platelet count is stable, but there is a risk of further decline in platelet count due to antibiotics-related side effects or underlying bleeding.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and the current rhythm is rate-controlled, but there is a risk of further arrhythmias and hemodynamic instability if not properly managed.
6. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, and the current medication regimen may not be optimal for managing the condition.
7. Aortic Valve Replacement: The patient has a bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement, and there is a risk of valve failure or thromboembolic events if not properly anticoagulated.
8. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently well-controlled, but there is a risk of further hypertension if not properly managed.
9. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, and the current medication regimen may not be optimal for managing the condition.
10. Wound Complications: The patient has a stage II ulcer on the back from a burn injury, and there is a risk of further wound complications if not properly managed.

To address these potential complications, the following interventions can be considered:

1. Close monitoring of respiratory function and ventilation settings to prevent further respiratory failure.
2. Aggressive management of gastrointestinal bleeding, including transfusion and close monitoring of HCT.
3. Optimal fluid management to prevent acute renal failure.
4. Regular platelet count monitoring and transfusion as needed to prevent thrombocytopenia.
5. Rate control and anticoagulation management for atrial fibrillation.
6. Re-evaluation of coronary artery disease medication regimen to optimize management.
7. Anticoagulation management for aortic valve replacement.
8. Hypertension management with medication adjustment as needed.
9. Hyperlipidemia management with medication adjustment as needed.
10. Wound care consultation and close monitoring of wound healing."

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**],
   patient became progressively hypercarbic and required intubation.
   Likely multifactorial; both infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac
   (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary
   edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -stop steroids today
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA: No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no fevers.
   Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   For Cardiac optimization:
   - cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - diltiazem to 15 QID
   - runs even today
   Ventilation:
   - Decrease vent settings to RR of 10 to correct alkalosis.
   - increase sedation, as agitated on the vent and ripping the skin on
   her hands.
   - to receive trach and PEG by IP today
   - start sedation wean (midaz to ativan or valium, fentanyl IV to patch)
   once trached.
   - start rehab screen
    Acute Renal Failure: Cre stable at 0.9. Consider starting ACEI once
   extubated and hemodynamically stable.
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable at 28 x3 days.   Hct down to 26,
   stable on rpt, likely due to some oozing from PICC site repositioning.
   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on
   admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis
   surrounding L upper leg. DIC labs negative.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping.
   - consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) after trach and
   if platelets improve.
   - check B12, folate iron studies
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Possible antibiotics or PPI related. Stable in 70s.
   PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies include
   infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - daily PLT check
   - d/c PPI (can cause thrombocytopenia)
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - consider heme consult if platelets do not improve upon d/c of PPI.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled  and hemodynamically
   stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed, but has been
   stable in Hct x3 days.
   - diltiazem 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider restarting coumadin after procedures.
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - consider restarting ASA
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension: improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to
   150s-160s.
   -cont Coreg at 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   -cont dilt for now
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CAD, s/p CABG and AVR, CHF, AF, and COPD. She is currently intubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and has failed extubation three times. She has been admitted for management of GI bleed and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current medications include diltiazem, carvedilol, simvastatin, lansoprazole, and insulin sliding scale. She has a tracheostomy planned for today.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including infectious, cardiac, and COPD-related factors. Further management will be needed to optimize her respiratory status.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are stable, but close monitoring will be necessary to ensure that her kidney function does not deteriorate further.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's HCT levels are stable, but further monitoring will be necessary to ensure that she does not experience further bleeding.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet levels are stable, but close monitoring will be necessary to ensure that her platelet count does not continue to decline.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's AF is currently rate-controlled, but further management will be needed to ensure that her heart rhythm remains stable.
6. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's CAD is well-controlled, but further management will be needed to ensure that her coronary arteries remain patent.
7. Aortic Valve Replacement: The patient's bioprosthetic aortic valve is not anticoagulated, but further management will be needed to ensure that her valve function remains optimal.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is well-controlled, but further management will be needed to ensure that her blood pressure remains within a safe range.
9. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia is well-controlled, but further management will be needed to ensure that her lipid levels remain within a safe range.
10. Back Wound: The patient's stage II ulcer on her back requires further wound care and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female who has undergone CABG and AVR, and is currently in the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and failure to extubate. She has a history of CAD, CHF, AF, and COPD, and is currently receiving oxygen therapy at home. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 68 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 120/37 mmHg. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 35%.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia of chronic disease, with low iron and transferrin levels, and elevated ferritin levels. Her B12 levels are low, and she is receiving IM B12 injections. Her folate levels are normal.

The patient has a tracheostomy scheduled and is also in need of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. She has a sacral decubitus ulcer that is improving, but not yet fully healed.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation, but may be at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying respiratory disease and the need for further respiratory support.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding due to her anemia and the need for anticoagulation therapy.
3. Infection: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer that is at risk for infection, and may be at risk for other infections due to her underlying medical conditions and the need for invasive procedures.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and may be at risk for further cardiac arrhythmias due to her underlying cardiac disease and the need for anticoagulation therapy.
5. Wound complications: The patient has a tracheostomy and PEG tube scheduled, and may be at risk for wound complications due to her underlying medical conditions and the need for invasive procedures."

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**],
   patient became progressively hypercarbic and required intubation.
   Likely multifactorial; both infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac
   (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary
   edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -taper prednisone to 10 mg PO daily
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA: No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no fevers.
   Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   For Cardiac optimization: Improved BP control on carvedilol. Metabolic
   alkalosis improved with IV diamox, and did have some diuresis with it
   earlier in the day.
   - cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - diltiazem to 15 QID
   - runs even today
   Ventilation:
   - VBG today shows appropriate ventilation (slightly alkalotic) .
   Continue current vent settings
   - NPO after MN for trach and PEG by IP in AM
    Acute Renal Failure: Cre stable at 0.9. Consider starting ACEI once
   extubated and hemodynamically stable.
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable at 28 x3 days.   Hct down to 26,
   stable on rpt, likely due to some oozing from PICC site repositioning.
   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on
   admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis
   surrounding L upper leg. DIC labs negative.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping.
   - consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) if Hct remains
   stable.
   - check B12, folate iron studies
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Possible antibiotics related. Stable in 70s.  PF4
   antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies include infection,
   although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled  and hemodynamically
   stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed, but has been
   stable in Hct x3 days.
   - diltiazem 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider restarting coumadin after procedures.
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - consider restarting ASA
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension: improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to
   150s-160s.
   -cont Coreg at 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   -cont dilt for now
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**],
   patient became progressively hypercarbic and required intubation.
   Likely multifactorial; both infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac
   (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary
   edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -taper prednisone to 10 mg PO daily
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA: No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no fevers.
   Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   For Cardiac optimization: Improved BP control on carvedilol. Metabolic
   alkalosis improved with IV diamox, and did have some diuresis with it
   earlier in the day.
   - cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - diltiazem to 15 QID
   - runs even today
   Ventilation:
   - VBG today shows appropriate ventilation (slightly alkalotic) .
   Continue current vent settings
   - NPO after MN for trach and PEG by IP in AM
    Acute Renal Failure: Cre stable at 0.9. Consider starting ACEI once
   extubated and hemodynamically stable.
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable at 28 x3 days.   Hct down to 26,
   stable on rpt, likely due to some oozing from PICC site repositioning.
   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on
   admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis
   surrounding L upper leg. DIC labs negative.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping.
   - consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) if Hct remains
   stable.
   - check B12, folate iron studies
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Possible antibiotics related. Stable in 70s.  PF4
   antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies include infection,
   although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled  and hemodynamically
   stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed, but has been
   stable in Hct x3 days.
   - diltiazem 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider restarting coumadin after procedures.
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - consider restarting ASA
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension: improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to
   150s-160s.
   -cont Coreg at 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   -cont dilt for now
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs.

   Disposition: in ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic heart failure. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia of chronic disease, low B12 and folate levels, and elevated ferritin. Her electrolyte levels are slightly alkalotic, and her creatinine is stable at 0.9 mg/dL. Her platelet count is stable in the 70s, and her international normalized ratio (INR) is 1.1.

The patient's medication regimen includes carvedilol, diltiazem, prednisone, and simvastatin. She is also receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem, which were completed after an 8-day course.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Continue current ventilation settings and monitor for signs of improvement.
* Acute renal failure: Consider starting an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) once the patient is extubated and hemodynamically stable.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: Monitor hematoma and consider restarting anticoagulation if the patient's hematocrit remains stable. Check B12, folate, and iron studies.
* Thrombocytopenia: Monitor platelet count daily and transfuse if necessary. Consider restarting anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation once procedures are complete and platelets recover.
* Atrial fibrillation: Continue rate control and hemodynamic stability. Consider restarting coumadin after procedures.
* Coronary artery disease: Continue simvastatin and consider restarting aspirin.
* Aortic valve replacement: Not anticoagulated.
* Hypertension: Continue coreg and consider restarting diltiazem.
* Hyperlipidemia: Continue simvastatin.
* Back wound: Monitor wound care and dressings.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: Continued hypercarbic respiratory failure could lead to respiratory arrest or need for further intubation.
* Renal failure: Acute renal failure could progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: Continued bleeding could lead to hypovolemic shock or require transfusion.
* Thrombocytopenia: Further decline in platelet count could lead to bleeding complications or require transfusion.
* Atrial fibrillation: Continued atrial fibrillation could lead to stroke or embolism.
* Coronary artery disease: Continued coronary artery disease could lead to myocardial infarction or require further intervention.
* Aortic valve replacement: Continued aortic valve replacement could lead to valve failure or require further intervention.
* Hypertension: Continued hypertension could lead to cardiovascular complications or require further medication adjustments.
* Hyperlipidemia: Continued hyperlipidemia could lead to cardiovascular complications or require further medication adjustments.
* Back wound: Continued wound infection or dehiscence could lead to further complications or require surgical intervention."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:
   At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then extubated [**11-11**], put on
   intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated secondary to AMS and hypercarbic
   resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**], patient became
   progressively hypercarbic and required intubation once again. Her
   respiratory failure is likely multifactorial; both infectious
   (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF
   causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD. Is s/p tracheostomy and
   PEG on [**2154-11-20**].
   1)       PNA:  No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no
   fevers. Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   2)       Cardiac optimization: Cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **], diltiazem 15 mg
   TID, I/O goal of even today
   3)       COPD: Steroids discontinued [**2154-11-20**]. Continue advair,
   ipratropium, home xopenex.
   4)       Ventilation: Doing well with new tracheostomy. Should attempt
   to wean from sedation today.
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:
   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on
   admission. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding groin. DIC labs
   negative. Patient had stable HCT for several days until drop this AM to
   24.9 in setting of ~200 mL coffee ground liquid output from new PEG
   tube. Received 1 U PRBC following discovery of coffee ground output. No
   other evidence of active bleeding. PPI had been discontinued [**2154-11-20**]
   due to concern that it was contributing to thrombocytopenia.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - Restart PPI
   - Consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) after trach and
   if platelets improve.
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   Possible antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued yesterday for
   this reason; however, had to be restarted today in setting of potential
   GI bleed. Platelets are up to 122 today following platelet transfusion
   yesterday. PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   # Atrial Fibrillation:
   Currently rate controlled when comfortable with pain and anxiety
   control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable. Currently not
   anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Diltiazem 15 TID
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease:
   s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Switched metoprolol to carvedilol [**11-13**] after bradycardia and
   hypotension [**11-12**].
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):
   Not anticoagulated.  Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe
   pulm regurg and mild pulm HTN
   # Hypertension:
   Improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to 150s-160s.
   - Will monitor closely as we liberate from sedation and narcotics
   - Continue carvedilol at 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue diltiazem 15 TID for now
   #Back Wound:
   Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at [**Location (un) **]. Wound
   care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped steroids (can
   contribute to skin thinning).

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:
   At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then extubated [**11-11**], put on
   intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated secondary to AMS and hypercarbic
   resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**], patient became
   progressively hypercarbic and required intubation once again. Her
   respiratory failure is likely multifactorial; both infectious
   (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF
   causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD. Is s/p tracheostomy and
   PEG on [**2154-11-20**].
   1)       PNA:  No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no
   fevers. Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   2)       Cardiac optimization: Cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **], diltiazem 15 mg
   TID, I/O goal of even today
   3)       COPD: Steroids discontinued [**2154-11-20**]. Continue advair,
   ipratropium, home xopenex.
   4)       Ventilation: Doing well with new tracheostomy. Should attempt
   to wean from sedation today.
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:
   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on
   admission. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding groin. DIC labs
   negative. Patient had stable HCT for several days until drop this AM to
   24.9 in setting of ~200 mL coffee ground liquid output from new PEG
   tube. Received 1 U PRBC following discovery of coffee ground output. No
   other evidence of active bleeding. PPI had been discontinued [**2154-11-20**]
   due to concern that it was contributing to thrombocytopenia.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - Restart PPI
   - Consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) after trach and
   if platelets improve.
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   Possible antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued yesterday for
   this reason; however, had to be restarted today in setting of potential
   GI bleed. Platelets are up to 122 today following platelet transfusion
   yesterday. PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   # Atrial Fibrillation:
   Currently rate controlled when comfortable with pain and anxiety
   control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable. Currently not
   anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Diltiazem 15 TID
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease:
   s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Switched metoprolol to carvedilol [**11-13**] after bradycardia and
   hypotension [**11-12**].
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):
   Not anticoagulated.  Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe
   pulm regurg and mild pulm HTN
   # Hypertension:
   Improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to 150s-160s.
   - Will monitor closely as we liberate from sedation and narcotics
   - Continue carvedilol at 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue diltiazem 15 TID for now
   #Back Wound:
   Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at [**Location (un) **]. Wound
   care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped steroids (can
   contribute to skin thinning).

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient underwent percutaneous tracheostomy and PEG insertion on [**2154-11-20**] and is currently on ventilatory support. She is experiencing some bleeding around the tracheostomy and PEG sites, with a total of 200cc of coffee grounds drainage from the PEG tube.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 122 K/uL (up from 67 K/uL yesterday)
* White blood cell count: 8.6 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 36 mg/dL
* Sodium: 139 mmol/L
* Potassium: 4.2 mmol/L
* Chloride: 106 mmol/L
* CO2: 43 mmHg
* Glucose: 126 mg/dL

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (96.9°F)
* Heart rate: 74 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 136/63 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 12 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's medical history and current conditions include:

* Coronary artery disease with a history of CABG and AVR
* Atrial fibrillation
* COPD
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Thrombocytopenia
* Hypercarbic respiratory failure
* Pneumonia (resolved)
* Flash pulmonary edema

The patient's current medications include:

* Fentanyl
* Midazolam
* Carvedilol
* Diltiazem
* Ipratropium
* Advair
* Home xopenex
* Simvastatin
* Tykosin (held)
* Digoxin (held)

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Continued bleeding around the tracheostomy and PEG sites
* Thrombocytopenia leading to bleeding or bleeding complications
* Respiratory failure due to hypercarbic respiratory failure or pneumonia
* Cardiac complications due to atrial fibrillation, hypertension, or coronary artery disease
* Gastrointestinal bleeding leading to anemia, bleeding complications, or sepsis
* Infection due to pneumonia or other sources
* Hypertension leading to cardiac complications or stroke

The patient's current plan includes:

* Maintaining active type and screen, PICC access
* Transfusion goal > 25
* Restarting PPI
* Considering restarting anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation once platelets recover
* Considering heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
* Continuing carvedilol, diltiazem, and simvastatin
* Monitoring for signs of bleeding or bleeding complications
* Restarting tube feeds via PEG
* Continuing glycemic control measures
* Maintaining prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP"

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-23**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**],
   patient became progressively hypercarbic and required intubation.
   Likely multifactorial; both infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac
   (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary
   edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -stop steroids today
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA: No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no fevers.
   Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   For Cardiac optimization:
   - cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - diltiazem to 15 QID\
   - runs even today
   Ventilation:
   - Decrease vent settings to RR of 10 to correct alkalosis.
   - increase sedation, as agitated on the vent and ripping the skin on
   her hands.
   - to receive trach and PEG by IP today
   - start sedation wean (midaz to ativan or valium, fentanyl IV to patch)
   once trached.
   - start rehab screen
   Acute Renal Failure: Cre stable at 0.9. Consider starting ACEI once
   extubated and hemodynamically stable.
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable at 28 x3 days.   Hct down to 26,
   stable on rpt, likely due to some oozing from PICC site repositioning.
   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on
   admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis
   surrounding L upper leg. DIC labs negative.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping.
   - consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) after trach and
   if platelets improve.
   - check B12, folate iron studies
   Thrombocytopenia:  Possible antibiotics or PPI related. Stable in 70s.
   PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies include
   infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - daily PLT check
   - d/c PPI (can cause thrombocytopenia)
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - consider heme consult if platelets do not improve upon d/c of PPI.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled  and hemodynamically
   stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed, but has been
   stable in Hct x3 days.
   - diltiazem 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider restarting coumadin after procedures.
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
    Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - consider restarting ASA
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   Hypertension: improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to
   150s-160s.
   - cont Coreg at 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - cont dilt for now
    Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.

The patient underwent percutaneous tracheostomy and PEG insertion, which was successful, but she is still experiencing some bleeding around the tracheostomy and PEG sites. Her hemoglobin level has dropped from 26.3 to 24.9, and her platelet count is trending down. The medical team is considering restarting anticoagulation therapy after the procedures, but is also concerned about the risk of bleeding.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100%. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show stable creatinine levels, but her platelet count is trending down. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are slightly elevated, and her lactate level is slightly elevated. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's medical plan includes continuing anticoagulation therapy after the procedures, restarting anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation, and considering restarting anticoagulation therapy for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. The medical team is also considering restarting anticoagulation therapy for pulmonary embolism (PE) prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding around the tracheostomy and PEG sites may continue or worsen, requiring further interventions.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, requiring further interventions such as increased oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine levels may continue to rise, requiring further interventions such as dialysis.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count may continue to drop, requiring further interventions such as platelet transfusions.
5. Infection: The patient's risk of infection may increase due to her immunocompromised state, requiring further interventions such as antibiotics and wound care.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, requiring further interventions such as cardioversion or anticoagulation therapy.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may continue or worsen, requiring further interventions such as endoscopy or surgery.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-23**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**],
   patient became progressively hypercarbic and required intubation.
   Likely multifactorial; both infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac
   (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary
   edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -stop steroids today
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA: No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no fevers.
   Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   For Cardiac optimization:
   - cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - diltiazem to 15 QID\
   - runs even today
   Ventilation:
   - Decrease vent settings to RR of 10 to correct alkalosis.
   - increase sedation, as agitated on the vent and ripping the skin on
   her hands.
   - to receive trach and PEG by IP today
   - start sedation wean (midaz to ativan or valium, fentanyl IV to patch)
   once trached.
   - start rehab screen
   Acute Renal Failure: Cre stable at 0.9. Consider starting ACEI once
   extubated and hemodynamically stable.
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable at 28 x3 days.   Hct down to 26,
   stable on rpt, likely due to some oozing from PICC site repositioning.
   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on
   admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis
   surrounding L upper leg. DIC labs negative.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping.
   - consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) after trach and
   if platelets improve.
   - check B12, folate iron studies
   Thrombocytopenia:  Possible antibiotics or PPI related. Stable in 70s.
   PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies include
   infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - daily PLT check
   - d/c PPI (can cause thrombocytopenia)
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - consider heme consult if platelets do not improve upon d/c of PPI.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled  and hemodynamically
   stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed, but has been
   stable in Hct x3 days.
   - diltiazem 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider restarting coumadin after procedures.
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
    Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - consider restarting ASA
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   Hypertension: improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to
   150s-160s.
   - cont Coreg at 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - cont dilt for now
    Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - diltiazem to 15 QID\
   - runs even today
   Ventilation:
   - Decrease vent settings to RR of 10 to correct alkalosis.
   - increase sedation, as agitated on the vent and ripping the skin on
   her hands.
   - to receive trach and PEG by IP today
   - start sedation wean (midaz to ativan or valium, fentanyl IV to patch)
   once trached.
   - start rehab screen
   Acute Renal Failure: Cre stable at 0.9. Consider starting ACEI once
   extubated and hemodynamically stable.
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable at 28 x3 days.   Hct down to 26,
   stable on rpt, likely due to some oozing from PICC site repositioning.
   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on
   admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis
   surrounding L upper leg. DIC labs negative.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping.
   - consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) after trach and
   if platelets improve.
   - check B12, folate iron studies
   Thrombocytopenia:  Possible antibiotics or PPI related. Stable in 70s.
   PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies include
   infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - daily PLT check
   - d/c PPI (can cause thrombocytopenia)
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - consider heme consult if platelets do not improve upon d/c of PPI.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled  and hemodynamically
   stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed, but has been
   stable in Hct x3 days.
   - diltiazem 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider restarting coumadin after procedures.
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
    Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - consider restarting ASA
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her respiratory rate is 12 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100% on 35% FiO2.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is currently rate-controlled with diltiazem. Her blood pressure is 136/63 mmHg, and her heart rate is 74 beats per minute.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which is being monitored closely. Her hemoglobin level is 8.4 g/dL, and her hematocrit is 24.9%.
* Hematological: The patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 122 K/uL. She is receiving platelet transfusions and has been discontinued from proton pump inhibitors (PPI) due to concerns about their contribution to thrombocytopenia.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. She is being closely monitored for signs of worsening renal function.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is still elevated, and she may require further adjustments to her ventilator settings.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding may require further management, including transfusions and possible endoscopy.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is still low, and she may require further platelet transfusions. Her PPI medication has been discontinued, and she may require alternative anticoagulation therapy.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she may require further management, including dialysis.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently rate-controlled, but she may require further management, including anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's medical history and current condition suggest that she is at risk for further complications, including respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, and atrial fibrillation. Therefore, it is essential to closely monitor her condition and adjust her treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   a-fib/bradycardia/sinus pauses
   thrombocytopenia
 contribution from zosyn?; HIT neg.  Monitor plts
   count.
   hyperglycemia
   Agree with plan to continue vent support.  Will decrease RR given that
   VBG is slightly alkalotic-- follow vbgs.  Scheduled for trach and PEG
   placement today by IP service today. Will then continue wean attempts
   as tolerated.   BP and HR remain better controlled with dilt, increased
   coreg dose. We continue to hold anticoag given thrombocytopenia and
   anemia. We have discussed restarting hep gtt after trach/peg placement
   given CHADs score but feel risk of bleeding exceeds this risk. Will d/c
   prednisone today. Continue MDIs, sx, and pulm toilet.  S/p course of
   vanco/[**Last Name (un) 430**] for pna.
        Hct reamins stable and suspect multifactorial etiology of
   anemia with probable slow GIB, hematoma, phlebotomy, and oozing from
   PICC line all factors.  Iron studies c/w ACD.  GI with no plan for
   scope. Continue to guiac stool.  Monitor hematoma on groin and
   back--this appears stable to resolving.  Keep active T and C.
        Thrombocytopenia remains stable but not improving since d/c of
   antibx to which this was attributed. Will stop PPI. No other obvious
   medications as potential cause. Supplement B12.  Consider heme consult
   for further recs.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Agree with plan to continue vent support.  Will decrease RR given that
   VBG is slightly alkalotic-- follow vbgs.  Scheduled for trach and PEG
   placement today by IP service today. Will then continue wean attempts
   as tolerated.   BP and HR remain better controlled with dilt, increased
   coreg dose. We continue to hold anticoag given thrombocytopenia and
   anemia. We have discussed restarting hep gtt after trach/peg placement
   given CHADs score but feel risk of bleeding exceeds this risk. Will d/c
   prednisone today. Continue MDIs, sx, and pulm toilet.  S/p course of
   vanco/[**Last Name (un) 430**] for pna.
        Hct reamins stable and suspect multifactorial etiology of
   anemia with probable slow GIB, hematoma, phlebotomy, and oozing from
   PICC line all factors.  Iron studies c/w ACD.  GI with no plan for

   back--this appears stable to resolving.  Keep active T and C.
        Thrombocytopenia remains stable but not improving since d/c of
   antibx to which this was attributed. Will stop PPI. No other obvious

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy. The patient has undergone percutaneous tracheostomy and PEG insertion yesterday and is tolerating these interventions well. The patient is awake and interactive, with no signs of distress or pain. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, and blood pressure of 142/76 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 10, and FiO2 of 35%.

The patient has several underlying medical conditions, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hyperglycemia. The patient's anemia is multifactorial, with possible causes including gastrointestinal bleeding, hematoma, phlebotomy, and oozing from the PICC line. The patient's thrombocytopenia has not improved since discontinuing antibiotics and is being monitored. The patient's hyperglycemia is being managed with medication.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.6, hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 67. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's plan includes continued ventilator support, weaning attempts as tolerated, and close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results. The patient is scheduled for tracheostomy and PEG placement today and will then continue weaning attempts as tolerated. The patient's anticoagulation therapy has been held due to thrombocytopenia and anemia, and the patient is being monitored for bleeding.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a critical condition that requires close monitoring and management.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia is a potential complication that may worsen if not managed properly.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is a potential complication that may increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is a potential complication that may increase the risk of complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is a potential complication that may worsen if not managed properly.
6. Hematoma: The patient's hematoma is a potential complication that may worsen if not managed properly.
7. Infection: The patient's infection is a potential complication that may worsen if not managed properly.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiovascular status is a potential complication that may worsen if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Continue ventilator support and weaning attempts as tolerated.
3. Manage the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia with appropriate medications and transfusions.
4. Manage the patient's hyperglycemia with appropriate medications and monitoring.
5. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and hematoma closely and manage as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient for signs of infection and manage as necessary.
7. Consider heme consult for further recommendations on managing the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia.
8. Consider adjusting the patient's anticoagulation therapy based on laboratory results and clinical condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who has undergone percutaneous tracheostomy and PEG insertion. The patient remains mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy and is receiving sedation and analgesia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, and blood pressure of 142/76 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase levels, which may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory response. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's physical examination is significant for respiratory distress, with clear breath sounds and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. The patient's abdominal examination is significant for soft, non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and they are receiving mechanical ventilation, which may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate dehydrogenase levels may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to pneumonia.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate dehydrogenase levels may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's PEG insertion and use of anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Wound infection: The patient's percutaneous tracheostomy and PEG insertion may increase the risk of wound infection.
6. Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate dehydrogenase levels may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy.
7. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level may indicate underlying kidney dysfunction, which could lead to renal failure.
8. Hepatic failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate underlying liver dysfunction, which could lead to hepatic failure.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 50 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has undergone percutaneous tracheostomy and PEG insertion, and remains mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, and blood pressure of 142/76 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on a FiO2 of 35%.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, and their respiratory and cardiovascular systems are stable. However, they have a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and coronary artery disease (CAD), which may be contributing to their respiratory failure.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. They also have a history of cardiac dysrhythmia, including atrial fibrillation and bradycardia.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuing to optimize their medical regimen for COPD, including discontinuing steroids.
2. Monitoring for evidence of gastrointestinal bleed, as they have a history of coffee grounds bleeding.
3. Monitoring the patient's platelet count to rule out zosyn-induced thrombocytopenia.
4. Initiating total parenteral nutrition (TPN) via the new PEG.
5. Managing the patient's cardiac dysrhythmia with pharmacological agents, and considering a cardiology consult to assist in management.
6. Providing prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer, as well as elevating the head of bed to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure due to underlying COPD and CAD.
2. Gastrointestinal bleed, which may be related to the PEG insertion.
3. Cardiac dysrhythmia, which may be exacerbated by pharmacological agents.
4. Thrombocytopenia, which may be related to zosyn or other medications.
5. Nutritional deficiencies due to inadequate nutrition.

To prevent these complications, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings. The patient's medical regimen should be optimized, and prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent complications such as DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. A multidisciplinary approach, including cardiology, gastroenterology, and nutrition consultations, may be necessary to ensure the patient receives optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:
   At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then extubated [**11-11**], put on
   intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated secondary to AMS and hypercarbic
   resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**], patient became
   progressively hypercarbic and required intubation once again. Her
   respiratory failure is likely multifactorial; both infectious
   (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF
   causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD. Is s/p tracheostomy and
   PEG on [**2154-11-20**].
   1)       PNA:  No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no
   fevers. Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   2)       Cardiac optimization: Cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **], diltiazem 15 mg
   TID, I/O goal of even today
   3)       COPD: Steroids discontinued [**2154-11-20**]. Continue advair,
   ipratropium, home xopenex.
   4)       Ventilation: Doing well with new tracheostomy. Should attempt
   to wean from sedation today.
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:
   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on
   admission. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding groin. DIC labs
   negative. Patient had stable HCT for several days until drop this AM to
   24.9 in setting of ~200 mL coffee ground liquid output from new PEG
   tube. Received 1 U PRBC following discovery of coffee ground output. No
   other evidence of active bleeding. PPI had been discontinued [**2154-11-20**]
   due to concern that it was contributing to thrombocytopenia.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - Restart PPI
   - Consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) after trach and
   if platelets improve.
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   Possible antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued yesterday for
   this reason; however, had to be restarted today in setting of potential
   GI bleed. Platelets are up to 122 today following platelet transfusion
   yesterday. PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   # Atrial Fibrillation:
   Currently rate controlled when comfortable with pain and anxiety
   control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable. Currently not
   anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Diltiazem 15 TID
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease:
   s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Switched metoprolol to carvedilol [**11-13**] after bradycardia and
   hypotension [**11-12**].
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):
   Not anticoagulated.  Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe
   pulm regurg and mild pulm HTN
   # Hypertension:
   Improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to 150s-160s.
   - Will monitor closely as we liberate from sedation and narcotics
   - Continue carvedilol at 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue diltiazem 15 TID for now
   #Back Wound:
   Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at [**Location (un) **]. Wound
   care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped steroids (can
   contribute to skin thinning).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: GI bleed
   24 Hour Events:
   - Concern for coffee ground liquid in G-tube bag prompted afternoon
   HCT, which was 28.4, an appropriate rise from 24.9 following 1U PRBC
   - Fentanyl drip and midazolam drip were both discontinued
   - PPI was restarted
   - Tube feeds were restarted
   - Patient's pain was managed with PRNs of morphine
   - Anxiety was managed with PRNs of lorazepam
   - Patient became somewhat agitated at night and received 5 mg of
   zyprexa, with little effect, then responded well to 1 mg lorazepam IV

   At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then extubated [**11-11**], put on
   intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated secondary to AMS and hypercarbic
   resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**], patient became
   progressively hypercarbic and required intubation once again. Her
   respiratory failure is likely multifactorial; both infectious
   (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF
   causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD. Is s/p tracheostomy and
   PEG on [**2154-11-20**].
   1)       PNA:  No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no
   fevers. Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   2)       Cardiac optimization: Cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **], diltiazem 15 mg
   TID, I/O goal of even today
   3)       COPD: Steroids discontinued [**2154-11-20**]. Continue advair,
   ipratropium, home xopenex.
   4)       Ventilation: Doing well with new tracheostomy. Should attempt
   to wean from sedation today.
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:
   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on
   admission. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding groin. DIC labs
   negative. Patient had stable HCT for several days until drop this AM to
   24.9 in setting of ~200 mL coffee ground liquid output from new PEG
   tube. Received 1 U PRBC following discovery of coffee ground output. No
   other evidence of active bleeding. PPI had been discontinued [**2154-11-20**]
   due to concern that it was contributing to thrombocytopenia.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - Restart PPI
   - Consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) after trach and
   if platelets improve.
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   Possible antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued yesterday for
   this reason; however, had to be restarted today in setting of potential
   GI bleed. Platelets are up to 122 today following platelet transfusion
   yesterday. PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   # Atrial Fibrillation:
   Currently rate controlled when comfortable with pain and anxiety
   control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable. Currently not
   anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Diltiazem 15 TID
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease:
   s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Switched metoprolol to carvedilol [**11-13**] after bradycardia and
   hypotension [**11-12**].
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):
   Not anticoagulated.  Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe
   pulm regurg and mild pulm HTN
   # Hypertension:
   Improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to 150s-160s.
   - Will monitor closely as we liberate from sedation and narcotics
   - Continue carvedilol at 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue diltiazem 15 TID for now
   #Back Wound:
   Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at [**Location (un) **]. Wound
   care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped steroids (can
   contribute to skin thinning).

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure of 174/50 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy through a tracheostomy tube and is mechanically ventilated.

The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is ongoing, with coffee-colored output from the gastrostomy tube. The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells following the discovery of the bleeding, and her hemoglobin level has stabilized at 9.4 g/dL.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, with contributions from infectious, cardiac, and COPD-related factors. She is receiving mechanical ventilation and is being weaned from sedation.

The patient's atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled with diltiazem, and she is not currently anticoagulated due to the risk of bleeding.

The patient's platelet count is 122, and she is at risk for thrombocytopenia due to her medical history and ongoing bleeding. She is receiving daily platelet transfusions and is being monitored for signs of bleeding.

The patient's skin integrity is compromised, with a large ecchymosis on her groin and legs. She has a history of skin tears and is at risk for further skin breakdown.

The patient's nutritional status is being monitored, and she is receiving fiber-rich nutrition through her gastrostomy tube.

The patient's glycemic control is being monitored, and she is at risk for hyperglycemia due to her medical history and ongoing bleeding.

The patient's lines and prophylaxis are being monitored, and she is at risk for central line-associated bloodstream infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to further blood loss and potential complications such as hypovolemic shock.
2. Respiratory failure, which could worsen due to ongoing hypercarbic respiratory failure and potential respiratory acidosis.
3. Thrombocytopenia, which could worsen due to ongoing bleeding and potential platelet transfusion reactions.
4. Skin breakdown, which could worsen due to ongoing skin compromise and potential pressure ulcers.
5. Infection, which could arise from the patient's underlying medical conditions and potential hospital-acquired infections such as central line-associated bloodstream infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
6. Cardiac complications, such as atrial fibrillation and potential cardiac arrest.
7. Gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal perforation or obstruction.
8. Nutritional deficiencies, which could arise due to ongoing bleeding and potential malnutrition.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and optimize her outcomes."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:
   At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then extubated [**11-11**], put on
   intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated secondary to AMS and hypercarbic
   resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**], patient became
   progressively hypercarbic and required intubation once again. Her
   respiratory failure is likely multifactorial; both infectious
   (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF
   causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD. Is s/p tracheostomy and
   PEG on [**2154-11-20**].
   1)       PNA:  No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no
   fevers. Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   2)       Cardiac optimization: Cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **], diltiazem 15 mg
   TID, I/O goal of even today
   3)       COPD: Steroids discontinued [**2154-11-20**]. Continue advair,
   ipratropium, home xopenex.
   4)       Ventilation: Doing well with new tracheostomy. Ongoing attempt
   to wean from sedation today while managing her agitation and confusion.
   Decrease in FiO2 requirement yesterday to 35%.
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:
   No EGD this admission. Only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive
   stool on admission. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding groin and
   extending up left flank. DIC labs negative. Patient had stable HCT for
   several days until drop [**2154-11-21**] AM to 24.9 in setting of ~200 mL
   coffee ground liquid output from new PEG tube. Received 1 U PRBC
   following discovery of coffee ground output and evening HCT check was
   28.4 on [**2154-11-21**]. This AM HCT was 27.0. No evidence of profuse active
   bleeding at this time as residuals on tube feeds without blood. Some
   slight oozing around peg tube site yesterday. PPI had been discontinued
   [**2154-11-20**] due to concern that it was contributing to thrombocytopenia,
   but was restarted on [**2154-11-21**].
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - Continue PPI
   - Consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) after trach and
   if platelets improve.
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   Possibly a medication effect due to antibiotics or PPI. PPI was
   discontinued [**2154-11-20**] for this reason; however, had to be restarted
   [**2154-11-21**] in setting of potential GI bleed with coffee ground appearing
   output from g-tube. Platelets up to 122 [**2154-11-21**] following platelet
   transfusion on [**2154-11-20**]. PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   Other etiologies include infection, although appears to be recovering
   from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   # Atrial Fibrillation:
   Currently rate controlled when comfortable with pain and anxiety
   control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable. Currently not
   anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Diltiazem 15 TID
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease:
   s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Switched metoprolol to carvedilol [**11-13**] after bradycardia and
   hypotension [**11-12**].
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):
   Not anticoagulated.  Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe
   pulm regurg and mild pulm HTN
   # Hypertension:
   With weaning of sedation, patient had systolic hypertension to the
   180s. Will need tighter control.
   - Will monitor closely as we liberate from sedation and narcotics
   - Can consider restarting home enalapril 10 mg daily
   - Continue carvedilol at 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue diltiazem 15 TID for now
   #Back Wound:
   Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at [**Location (un) **]. Wound
   care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped steroids (can
   contribute to skin thinning).

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:
   At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then extubated [**11-11**], put on
   intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated secondary to AMS and hypercarbic
   resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**], patient became
   progressively hypercarbic and required intubation once again. Her
   respiratory failure is likely multifactorial; both infectious
   (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF
   causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD. Is s/p tracheostomy and
   PEG on [**2154-11-20**].
   1)       PNA:  No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no
   fevers. Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   2)       Cardiac optimization: Cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **], diltiazem 15 mg
   TID, I/O goal of even today
   3)       COPD: Steroids discontinued [**2154-11-20**]. Continue advair,
   ipratropium, home xopenex.
   4)       Ventilation: Doing well with new tracheostomy. Ongoing attempt
   to wean from sedation today while managing her agitation and confusion.
   Decrease in FiO2 requirement yesterday to 35%.
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:
   No EGD this admission. Only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive
   stool on admission. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding groin and
   extending up left flank. DIC labs negative. Patient had stable HCT for
   several days until drop [**2154-11-21**] AM to 24.9 in setting of ~200 mL
   coffee ground liquid output from new PEG tube. Received 1 U PRBC
   following discovery of coffee ground output and evening HCT check was
   28.4 on [**2154-11-21**]. This AM HCT was 27.0. No evidence of profuse active
   bleeding at this time as residuals on tube feeds without blood. Some
   slight oozing around peg tube site yesterday. PPI had been discontinued
   [**2154-11-20**] due to concern that it was contributing to thrombocytopenia,
   but was restarted on [**2154-11-21**].
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - Continue PPI
   - Consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) after trach and
   if platelets improve.
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   Possibly a medication effect due to antibiotics or PPI. PPI was
   discontinued [**2154-11-20**] for this reason; however, had to be restarted
   [**2154-11-21**] in setting of potential GI bleed with coffee ground appearing
   output from g-tube. Platelets up to 122 [**2154-11-21**] following platelet
   transfusion on [**2154-11-20**]. PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   Other etiologies include infection, although appears to be recovering
   from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   # Atrial Fibrillation:
   Currently rate controlled when comfortable with pain and anxiety
   control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable. Currently not
   anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Diltiazem 15 TID
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease:
   s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Switched metoprolol to carvedilol [**11-13**] after bradycardia and
   hypotension [**11-12**].
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):
   Not anticoagulated.  Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe
   pulm regurg and mild pulm HTN
   # Hypertension:
   With weaning of sedation, patient had systolic hypertension to the
   180s. Will need tighter control.
   - Will monitor closely as we liberate from sedation and narcotics
   - Can consider restarting home enalapril 10 mg daily
   - Continue carvedilol at 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue diltiazem 15 TID for now
   #Back Wound:
   Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at [**Location (un) **]. Wound
   care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped steroids (can
   contribute to skin thinning).

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. GI bleed: The patient's coffee ground liquid output from the PEG tube is a concerning sign, and the HCT drop from 28.4 to 24.9 on November 21 suggests ongoing bleeding. The patient's platelet count is also low, which may be contributing to the bleeding.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be due to medication effects, infection, or other etiologies. The patient's PF4 antibodies are negative, but the platelet count is still low.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is currently rate-controlled, but not anticoagulated due to the GI bleed.
4. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has coronary artery disease and has undergone CABG and AVR.
5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which may need to be tightly controlled as they are weaned off sedation and narcotics.
6. Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity due to burns and ecchymosis, which may lead to further complications.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial, and may require further management.

The patient's current medications include:

* PPI

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:
   At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then extubated [**11-11**], put on
   intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated secondary to AMS and hypercarbic
   resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**], patient became
   progressively hypercarbic and required intubation once again. Her
   respiratory failure is likely multifactorial; both infectious
   (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF
   causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD. Is s/p tracheostomy and
   PEG on [**2154-11-20**].
   1)       PNA:  No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no
   fevers. Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   2)       Cardiac optimization: Cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **], diltiazem 15 mg
   TID, I/O goal of even today
   3)       COPD: Steroids discontinued [**2154-11-20**]. Continue advair,
   ipratropium, home xopenex.
   4)       Ventilation: Doing well with new tracheostomy. Ongoing attempt
   to wean from sedation today while managing her agitation and confusion
   with PRNs of benzos as zyprexa seemed to have little impact yesterday
   evening
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:
   No EGD this admission. Only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive
   stool on admission. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding groin and
   extending up left flank. DIC labs negative. Patient had stable HCT for
   several days until drop [**2154-11-21**] AM to 24.9 in setting of ~200 mL
   coffee ground liquid output from new PEG tube. Received 1 U PRBC
   following discovery of coffee ground output and evening HCT check was
   28.4 on [**2154-11-21**]. This AM HCT was 27.0. No evidence of profuse active
   bleeding at this time as residuals on tube feeds without blood. Some
   slight oozing around peg tube site yesterday. PPI had been discontinued
   [**2154-11-20**] due to concern that it was contributing to thrombocytopenia,
   but was restarted on [**2154-11-21**]. This AM on rounds report of large volume
   vomitus tinged with blood.
   - Hold tube feeds until etiology of blood in vomitus is determined
   - Consult GI for EGD to assess for UGI bleed
   - Follow PM HCT today
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal HCT > 25
   - Continue PPI
   - Consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) after trach and
   if platelets improve.
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   Possibly a medication effect due to antibiotics or PPI. PPI was
   discontinued [**2154-11-20**] for this reason; however, had to be restarted
   [**2154-11-21**] in setting of potential GI bleed with coffee ground appearing
   output from g-tube. Platelets up to 122 [**2154-11-21**] following platelet
   transfusion on [**2154-11-20**]. Then platelets fell slightly to 94 this AM.
   PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies include
   infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   # Atrial Fibrillation:
   Currently rate controlled when comfortable with pain and anxiety
   control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable. Currently not
   anticoagulated due to thrombocytopenia and history of GI bleed.
   - Diltiazem 15 TID
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease:
   s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Continue carvedilol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):
   Not anticoagulated.  Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe
   pulm regurg and mild pulm HTN.
   # Hypertension:
   With weaning of sedation, patient had systolic hypertension to the
   180s. Will need tighter control.
   - Will monitor closely as we liberate from sedation and narcotics
   - Can consider restarting home enalapril 10 mg daily
   - Hold carvedilol at 25 [**Hospital1 **], diltiazem 15 TID for now while working up
   GI bleeding
   - Consider metoprolol IV and hydral IV PRN while tube use on hold in
   setting of potential GI bleed.
   #Back Wound:
   Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at [**Location (un) **]. Wound
   care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped steroids (can
   contribute to skin thinning).

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a tracheostomy and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's condition has been complicated by atrial fibrillation, which is currently rate-controlled. She has also developed thrombocytopenia, which is being managed with platelet transfusions. The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding has been attributed to a possible medication effect, and she has been restarted on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

The patient's respiratory status has been improving, with a decrease in her respiratory rate and an increase in her oxygen saturation. Her cardiac status has also been stable, with a heart rate of 78 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 174/50 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is a potential complication that could lead to further bleeding, anemia, and hypovolemic shock.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is a potential complication that could lead to bleeding, petechiae, and ecchymoses.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is a potential complication that could lead to stroke, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a potential complication that could lead to further respiratory distress, hypoxia, and hypercarbia.
5. Infection: The patient's infection is a potential complication that could lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
6. Bleeding from the tracheostomy site: The patient's tracheostomy site is a potential source of bleeding, which could lead to further complications.
7. Skin integrity issues: The patient's skin integrity issues, including the ecchymosis and skin tears, are potential complications that could lead to further skin breakdown and infection.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and thrombocytopenia.
2. Restart the patient on anticoagulation therapy once her platelet count improves and her gastrointestinal bleeding is under control.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her ventilation settings as needed.
4. Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with rate control and anticoagulation therapy.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's infection and adjust her antibiotic therapy as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding from the tracheostomy site and adjust her treatment as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's skin integrity issues and adjust her treatment as needed."

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:
   At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then extubated [**11-11**], put on
   intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated secondary to AMS and hypercarbic
   resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**], patient became
   progressively hypercarbic and required intubation once again. Her
   respiratory failure is likely multifactorial; both infectious
   (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF
   causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD. Is s/p tracheostomy and
   PEG on [**2154-11-20**].
   1)       PNA:  No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no
   fevers. Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   2)       Cardiac optimization: Cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **], diltiazem 15 mg
   TID, I/O goal of even today
   3)       COPD: Steroids discontinued [**2154-11-20**]. Continue advair,
   ipratropium, home xopenex.
   4)       Ventilation: Doing well with new tracheostomy. Should attempt
   to wean from sedation today.
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:
   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on
   admission. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding groin. DIC labs
   negative. Patient had stable HCT for several days until drop this AM to
   24.9 in setting of ~200 mL coffee ground liquid output from new PEG
   tube. Received 1 U PRBC following discovery of coffee ground output. No
   other evidence of active bleeding. PPI had been discontinued [**2154-11-20**]
   due to concern that it was contributing to thrombocytopenia.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - Restart PPI
   - Consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) after trach and
   if platelets improve.
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   Possible antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued yesterday for
   this reason; however, had to be restarted today in setting of potential
   GI bleed. Platelets are up to 122 today following platelet transfusion
   yesterday. PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   # Atrial Fibrillation:
   Currently rate controlled when comfortable with pain and anxiety
   control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable. Currently not
   anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Diltiazem 15 TID
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease:
   s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Switched metoprolol to carvedilol [**11-13**] after bradycardia and
   hypotension [**11-12**].
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):
   Not anticoagulated.  Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe
   pulm regurg and mild pulm HTN
   # Hypertension:
   Improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to 150s-160s.
   - Will monitor closely as we liberate from sedation and narcotics
   - Continue carvedilol at 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue diltiazem 15 TID for now
   #Back Wound:
   Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at [**Location (un) **]. Wound
   care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped steroids (can
   contribute to skin thinning).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: GI bleed

   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:
   At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then extubated [**11-11**], put on
   intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated secondary to AMS and hypercarbic
   resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**], patient became
   progressively hypercarbic and required intubation once again. Her
   respiratory failure is likely multifactorial; both infectious
   (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF
   causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD. Is s/p tracheostomy and
   PEG on [**2154-11-20**].
   1)       PNA:  No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no
   fevers. Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   2)       Cardiac optimization: Cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **], diltiazem 15 mg
   TID, I/O goal of even today
   3)       COPD: Steroids discontinued [**2154-11-20**]. Continue advair,
   ipratropium, home xopenex.
   4)       Ventilation: Doing well with new tracheostomy. Should attempt
   to wean from sedation today.
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:
   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on
   admission. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding groin. DIC labs
   negative. Patient had stable HCT for several days until drop this AM to
   24.9 in setting of ~200 mL coffee ground liquid output from new PEG
   tube. Received 1 U PRBC following discovery of coffee ground output. No
   other evidence of active bleeding. PPI had been discontinued [**2154-11-20**]
   due to concern that it was contributing to thrombocytopenia.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - Restart PPI
   - Consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) after trach and
   if platelets improve.
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   Possible antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued yesterday for
   this reason; however, had to be restarted today in setting of potential
   GI bleed. Platelets are up to 122 today following platelet transfusion
   yesterday. PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   # Atrial Fibrillation:
   Currently rate controlled when comfortable with pain and anxiety
   control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable. Currently not
   anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Diltiazem 15 TID
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease:
   s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Switched metoprolol to carvedilol [**11-13**] after bradycardia and
   hypotension [**11-12**].
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):
   Not anticoagulated.  Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe
   pulm regurg and mild pulm HTN
   # Hypertension:
   Improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to 150s-160s.
   - Will monitor closely as we liberate from sedation and narcotics
   - Continue carvedilol at 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue diltiazem 15 TID for now
   #Back Wound:
   Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at [**Location (un) **]. Wound
   care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped steroids (can
   contribute to skin thinning).

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who presented to the ICU with gastrointestinal bleeding, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation. She has undergone several tracheostomies and has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The patient's condition has been unstable, with repeated episodes of respiratory failure, requiring intubation and ventilation. She has also experienced thrombocytopenia, which has responded to platelet transfusions. The patient's bleeding has been managed with transfusions and medication, and she has been restarted on proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's bleeding has been managed, but there is a risk of further bleeding, particularly with the restarting of anticoagulation therapy.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and may require continued ventilation and oxygen therapy.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is still low, and there is a risk of further bleeding or thrombotic complications.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is being rate-controlled, but there is a risk of further arrhythmias or cardiac complications.
5. Infection: The patient has had a prolonged hospital stay and has been exposed to multiple antibiotics, which may increase the risk of infection.
6. Wound complications: The patient has a stage II ulcer on her back, which may require further wound care and dressing changes.
7. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to further complications, such as acidosis, hypercapnia, and respiratory distress.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is complex and requires continued close monitoring and management. The plan is to continue to manage her bleeding, respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation, while also addressing her thrombocytopenia and potential wound complications. The patient will require continued transfusions, medication, and oxygen therapy to manage her condition."

   Chief Complaint: Hypoxia, failure to extubate
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient had some blood-tinged vomit yesterday .  Her Hct remained
   stable at 27.0 in the am and 29.4 in the afternoon.  GI was contact[**Name (NI) **],
   but did not feel that the bleeding was an acute issue and did not want
   to scope her this hospitalization unless it worsened.  IP was told
   about his and offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we want
   this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they don't
   think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind.
   - Her tube feeds have been held given the bleeding and her meds were
   changed to IV.
   - CXR showed improving left retrocardiac opacity (thought to reflects a
   combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis); no evidence of
   aspiration.
   - Patient had elevated SBP's.  Was given an additional 5 mg IV
   metoprolol (in addition to 10 mg IV q6h), however her SBPs remained in
   the 180's to 190's (asymptomatic).  She was given 10 mg IV hydralazine
   and her metoprolol was increased to 15 mg IV q6h.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.

   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Has blood tinged vomit yesterday.  Hct
   was stable in high 20
s.  GIU c/s obtained who agreeded that bleeding
   was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated inless GIB
   worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we
   want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they
   don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - Restarted PPI yesterday
 with close monitoring of plt count
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable in 90-100
s.  Unclear cause. Possibiilties
   include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued for this
   reason; however, had to be restarted today in setting of potential GI
   bleed. Patient received plt transfusion 2 days ago with bump to 122
   from 65/  PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Diltiazem changed to IV, BB changed to IV
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Switched metoprolol to carvedilol [**11-13**] after bradycardia and

Based on the patient's daily progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has failed extubation three times, and the current diagnosis is atrial flutter, respiratory failure, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient has been experiencing GI bleeding, with blood-tinged vomit yesterday. Her hemoglobin (Hb) level remains stable, but her platelet count is slightly low. The patient has received a platelet transfusion, and her platelet count has increased to 122. However, it is unclear whether the bleeding is acute or chronic.

The patient has also been experiencing atrial fibrillation, which is currently being rate-controlled with pain and anxiety management. She is not anticoagulated due to the GI bleed, but may be restarted on anticoagulation once her platelets are stable and there is no evidence of ongoing GI bleeding.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). She has been taking various medications, including beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and anticoagulants.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 68 beats per minute, blood pressure of 115/44 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 99%, and she is receiving oxygen therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 122
* White blood cell count: 4.6
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 109 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.6 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.5 g/dL
* LDH: 284 IU/L
* Calcium: 9.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.8 mg/dL

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Optimizing cardiac status with beta blockers and calcium channel blockers
* Maintaining active type and screen, PICC access
* Transfusion goal > 25
* Restarting proton pump inhibitor (PPI) with close monitoring of platelet count
* Daily platelet check
* Transfusing platelets < 50 or active bleeding
* Considering restarting anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation once platelets recover
* Holding tyrosine kinase inhibitor (tyrosinase) and digoxin
* Continuing simvastatin
* Switching metoprolol to carvedilol
* Considering restarting aspirin once platelets stable and no evidence of ongoing GI bleeding

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: Glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale
* Lines: PICC line and prophylactic SQ UF heparin for DVT
* Prophylaxis: Stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP prophylaxis
* Comments: Patient discussed on interdisciplinary rounds, code status: full code, and disposition: ICU"

   Chief Complaint: Hypoxia, failure to extubate
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient had some blood-tinged vomit yesterday .  Her Hct remained
   stable at 27.0 in the am and 29.4 in the afternoon.  GI was contact[**Name (NI) **],
   but did not feel that the bleeding was an acute issue and did not want
   to scope her this hospitalization unless it worsened.  IP was told
   about his and offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we want
   this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they don't
   think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind.
   - Her tube feeds have been held given the bleeding and her meds were
   changed to IV.
   - CXR showed improving left retrocardiac opacity (thought to reflects a
   combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis); no evidence of
   aspiration.
   - Patient had elevated SBP's.  Was given an additional 5 mg IV
   metoprolol (in addition to 10 mg IV q6h), however her SBPs remained in
   the 180's to 190's (asymptomatic).  She was given 10 mg IV hydralazine
   and her metoprolol was increased to 15 mg IV q6h.

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: Hypoxia, failure to extubate
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient had some blood-tinged vomit yesterday .  Her Hct remained
   stable at 27.0 in the am and 29.4 in the afternoon.  GI was contact[**Name (NI) **],
   but did not feel that the bleeding was an acute issue and did not want
   to scope her this hospitalization unless it worsened.  IP was told
   about his and offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we want
   this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they don't
   think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind.
   - Her tube feeds have been held given the bleeding and her meds were
   changed to IV.
   - CXR showed improving left retrocardiac opacity (thought to reflects a
   combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis); no evidence of
   aspiration.
   - Patient had elevated SBP's.  Was given an additional 5 mg IV
   metoprolol (in addition to 10 mg IV q6h), however her SBPs remained in
   the 180's to 190's (asymptomatic).  She was given 10 mg IV hydralazine
   and her metoprolol was increased to 15 mg IV q6h.

* Compliance: 50 cmH2O/mL

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General appearance: No acute distress
* Eyes/conjunctiva: Normal
* Head, ears, nose, throat: Normocephalic, tracheostomy
* Cardiovascular: Hyperdynamic, normal S1 and S2, no systolic murmur
* Peripheral vascular: Normal radial and digital pulses
* Respiratory/chest: Symmetric expansion, diminished breath sounds at bases, rhonchorous throughout
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
* Extremities: Right 1+, left 1+
* Skin: Warm
* Neurologic: Responds to verbal stimuli, not assessed for movement or tone

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Continued gastrointestinal bleeding
* Respiratory failure or worsening respiratory distress
* Atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation with potential for cardiac arrhythmias

   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach ane PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem
   - optimiazing cardiac status with betablocker and CCB
 changed to IV
   yesterday
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Has blood tinged vomit yesterday.  Hct
   was stable in high 20
s.  GIU c/s obtained who agreeded that bleeding
   was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated inless GIB
   worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we
   want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they
   don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of
   4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - Restarted PPI yesterday
 with close monitoring of plt count
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable in 90-100
s.  Unclear cause. Possibiilties
   include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued for this
   reason; however, had to be restarted today in setting of potential GI
   bleed. Patient received plt transfusion 2 days ago with bump to 122
   from 65/  PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   - Restart tube feeds with predosing of Zofran from nausea
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Will need scope if bleeds with tube feeds
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - will change back to po dilt and carvediolol with tube feeds, titrate
   up as necessary
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin

   # Hypertension: Patient had elevated SBP's overnight  Was given an
   additional 5 mg IV metoprolol (in addition to 10 mg IV q6h), however
   her SBPs remained in the 180's to 190's (asymptomatic).  She was given

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: Hypoxia, failure to extubate
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient had some blood-tinged vomit yesterday .  Her Hct remained
   stable at 27.0 in the am and 29.4 in the afternoon.  GI was contact[**Name (NI) **],
   but did not feel that the bleeding was an acute issue and did not want
   to scope her this hospitalization unless it worsened.  IP was told
   about his and offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we want
   this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they don't
   think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind.
   - Her tube feeds have been held given the bleeding and her meds were
   changed to IV.
   - CXR showed improving left retrocardiac opacity (thought to reflects a
   combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis); no evidence of
   aspiration.
   - Patient had elevated SBP's.  Was given an additional 5 mg IV
   metoprolol (in addition to 10 mg IV q6h), however her SBPs remained in
   the 180's to 190's (asymptomatic).  She was given 10 mg IV hydralazine
   and her metoprolol was increased to 15 mg IV q6h.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and aortic valve replacement. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to failure to extubate, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Atrial flutter with a heart rate of 68 beats per minute.
2. Hypertension, with blood pressures ranging from 115/44 mmHg to 196/151 mmHg.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding, with blood-tinged vomit and a stable hematocrit.
4. Thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count ranging from 90 to 100 k/uL.
5. Respiratory failure, with a respiratory rate of 19 inspirations per minute and a PaO2 of 99%.
6. Hypercarbic respiratory failure, with a PaCO2 of 31 mmHg.
7. Impaired skin integrity, with a stage II ulcer on her back from a burn injury.

The patient's medical history is significant for:

1. Coronary artery disease, with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement.
2. Atrial fibrillation, with a history of atrial flutter.
3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding, with a history of bleeding from the PEG site.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Optimizing cardiac status with beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers.
2. Continuing Advair, ipratropium, and home xopenex.
3. Restarting tube feeds with predosing of Zofran for nausea.
4. Guaiac testing of stools.
5. Considering a scope if bleeding worsens.
6. Restarting anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation once platelets recover.
7. Considering heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend.
8. Restarting carvediolol and simvastatin.
9. Holding tykosin and digoxin.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
2. Hypotension, due to the patient's history of hypertension and cardiac disease.
3. Respiratory failure, due to the patient's history of COPD and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding, due to the patient's history of bleeding from the PEG site.
5. Thrombocytopenia, due to the patient's history of bleeding and platelet transfusions.
6. Skin breakdown, due to the patient's history of impaired skin integrity and pressure ulcers.
7. Infection, due to the patient's history of pneumonia and potential bacterial contamination of the PEG site.

To prevent these complications, the patient should be closely monitored and treated with medications and interventions as needed. The patient's family should be educated on the importance of monitoring the patient's condition and reporting any changes to the healthcare team."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPRIATORY FAILURE (failed extubation X 3)
 s/p Trach.  Hope to
   continue work towards weaning from mechanical ventilation.  Obstacles
   include underlying COPD and CAD (suspect component of cardiac
   ischemia).  Monitor progress, work towards trach collar trials.  Rehab
   screening in progress.
   COPD
 continue to optimized medical regimen.  D/C steroids.
   ANEMIA
 Suspect related recent groin hematoma, and now predominately
   to phlebotomy.  Last PRBC transfusion [**2154-11-21**].  Monitor for eivdence of
   GI bleed.  Currently stable.
   GI BLEED
 coffee grounds possibly related to PEG, now resolved.  Need
   to monitor closely for GI bleed, as GI bleed was initial problem at
   time of transfer to [**Hospital1 54**].
   HYPTERTENSION -- resume and adjust PO meds.
   SKIN BURN, BACK -- local care.
   GROIN HEMATOMA
 stable.  Monitor exam.
   CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIA -- a-fib/bradycardia/sinus pauses.  Sensitive to
   pharmacological agents.  Consider Cardiology consult to assist in
   mangement.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 contribution from antibiotics (zosyn?); HIT neg.
   Monitor plts count.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 resume TF via new PEG.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPRIATORY FAILURE (failed extubation X 3)
 s/p Trach.  Hope to
   continue work towards weaning from mechanical ventilation.  Obstacles
   include underlying COPD and CAD (suspect component of cardiac
   ischemia).  Monitor progress, work towards trach collar trials.  Rehab
   screening in progress.
   COPD
 continue to optimized medical regimen.  D/C steroids.
   ANEMIA
 Suspect related recent groin hematoma, and now predominately
   to phlebotomy.  Last PRBC transfusion [**2154-11-21**].  Monitor for eivdence of
   GI bleed.  Currently stable.
   GI BLEED
 coffee grounds possibly related to PEG, now resolved.  Need
   to monitor closely for GI bleed, as GI bleed was initial problem at
   time of transfer to [**Hospital1 54**].
   HYPTERTENSION -- resume and adjust PO meds.
   SKIN BURN, BACK -- local care.
   GROIN HEMATOMA
 stable.  Monitor exam.
   CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIA -- a-fib/bradycardia/sinus pauses.  Sensitive to
   pharmacological agents.  Consider Cardiology consult to assist in
   mangement.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 contribution from antibiotics (zosyn?); HIT neg.
   Monitor plts count.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. The patient remains mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy and is tolerating intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) mode. The patient has experienced episodes of hypertension, which have required adjustments to antihypertensive medications.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, which is suspected to be related to recent groin hematoma and phlebotomy. The patient's gastrointestinal bleed has resolved, but close monitoring is necessary for any signs of recurrence. The patient's skin burn on the back is being managed with local care.

The patient's cardiac rhythm is atrial flutter with bradycardia and sinus pauses, making them sensitive to pharmacological agents. A cardiology consult may be necessary to assist in management.

The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is thought to be contributed by antibiotics. Platelet counts will need to be monitored. The patient's nutritional support will resume via a new percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: Weaning from mechanical ventilation may be challenging due to the patient's underlying COPD and CAD.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to complications such as hypoxia and decreased cardiac output.
3. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleed and the presence of coffee grounds in their emesis suggest a risk of recurrent bleeding.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial flutter with bradycardia and sinus pauses may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or other complications.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly if they require invasive procedures.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen, leading to cardiac complications or cerebrovascular accidents.
7. Skin burn: The patient's skin burn may become infected or worsen, leading to sepsis or other complications.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional support may not be adequate, leading to malnutrition and decreased immune function.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their multiple medical conditions to prevent complications and improve their outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPRIATORY FAILURE (failed extubation X 3)
 s/p Trach.  Hope to
   continue work towards weaning from mechanical ventilation.  Obstacles
   include underlying COPD and CAD (suspect component of cardiac
   ischemia).  Monitor progress, work towards trach collar trials.  Rehab
   screening in progress.
   COPD
 continue to optimized medical regimen.  D/C steroids.
   ANEMIA
 Suspect related recent groin hematoma, and now predominately
   to phlebotomy.  Last PRBC transfusion [**2154-11-21**].  Monitor for eivdence of
   GI bleed.  Currently stable.
   GI BLEED
 coffee grounds possibly related to PEG, now resolved.  Need
   to monitor closely for GI bleed, as GI bleed was initial problem at
   time of transfer to [**Hospital1 54**].
   HYPTERTENSION -- resume and adjust PO meds.
   SKIN BURN, BACK -- local care.
   GROIN HEMATOMA
 stable.  Monitor exam.
   CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIA -- a-fib/bradycardia/sinus pauses.  Sensitive to
   pharmacological agents.  Consider Cardiology consult to assist in
   mangement.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 contribution from antibiotics (zosyn?); HIT neg.
   Monitor plts count.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 resume TF via new PEG.

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, who remains mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy (trach). The patient has experienced several episodes of hypertension, which have required adjustments to antihypertensive medications. The patient has also had coffee-ground emesis, which has resolved, and a stool test has revealed a positive guaiac result.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure of 152/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's cardiac rhythm is atrial flutter.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, and their respiratory and cardiovascular systems are stable. The patient's abdominal examination is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present.

Laboratory results indicate anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dL. The patient's white blood cell count is 4.6 K/uL, and their platelet count is 61 K/uL. The patient's liver function tests are within normal limits, and their electrolyte levels are stable.

The patient's medical history is significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and a recent groin hematoma. The patient is also experiencing skin burns on their back and cardiac dysrhythmia.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuing work towards weaning from mechanical ventilation, with obstacles including underlying COPD and CAD.
2. Optimizing the patient's medical regimen for COPD.
3. Monitoring for evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, as the patient has had a recent episode of coffee-ground emesis.
4. Resuming and adjusting oral medications for hypertension.
5. Providing local care for the patient's skin burns on their back.
6. Monitoring the patient's platelet count and considering a platelet transfusion if necessary.
7. Resuming tube feeds via a new percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.
8. Continuing to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and considering a cardiology consult if necessary.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of indwelling lines and tubes increase the risk of developing sepsis.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's recent episode of coffee-ground emesis and positive guaiac result in their stool test indicate a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac dysrhythmia and atrial flutter increase the risk of developing further cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not adequately treated, which could further compromise their respiratory and cardiovascular function.
7. Skin infections: The patient's skin burns and compromised immune system increase the risk of developing skin infections.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's progress and adjust their plan of care accordingly to minimize the risk of these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypotension/MS changes: Pt had episode of MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7331**] this
   morning associated with hypotension.  Does not appear to be septic
   physiology without fevers or positive culture data.  Responded to fluid
   boluses.  Other potential etiologies include hypoperfusion/ischemia,
   intracranial hemorrhage or CVA.
   - stat Head CT
   - hold antihypertensives until more stable
   - continue to monitor mental status
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach ane PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem
   - optimiazing cardiac status with betablocker and CCB
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Has blood tinged vomit yesterday.  Hct
   was stable in high 20
s.  GIU c/s obtained who agreeded that bleeding
   was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated inless GIB
   worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we
   want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they
   don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of
   4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable in 90-100
s.  Unclear cause. Possibiilties
   include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued for this
   reason; however, had to be restarted today in setting of potential GI
   bleed. Patient received plt transfusion 2 days ago with bump to 122
   from 65/  PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   - Restart tube feeds with predosing of Zofran from nausea
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Will need scope if bleeds with tube feeds
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - will change back to po dilt and carvediolol with tube feeds, titrate
   up as necessary
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Restarted carvediolol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   # Hypertension: Had been hypertensive requring IV Hydralazine.
   - hold antihypertensives while hypotensive; reintroduce medications

   morning associated with hypotension.  Does not appear to be septic
   physiology without fevers or positive culture data.  Responded to fluid
   boluses.  Other potential etiologies include hypoperfusion/ischemia,
   intracranial hemorrhage or CVA.
   - stat Head CT
   - hold antihypertensives until more stable
   - continue to monitor mental status
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.

   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Has blood tinged vomit yesterday.  Hct
   was stable in high 20
s.  GIU c/s obtained who agreeded that bleeding
   was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated inless GIB
   worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we
   want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they
   don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of
   4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable in 90-100
s.  Unclear cause. Possibiilties
   include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued for this
   reason; however, had to be restarted today in setting of potential GI
   bleed. Patient received plt transfusion 2 days ago with bump to 122
   from 65/  PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   - Restart tube feeds with predosing of Zofran from nausea
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Will need scope if bleeds with tube feeds
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - will change back to po dilt and carvediolol with tube feeds, titrate
   up as necessary
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Restarted carvediolol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   # Hypertension: Had been hypertensive requring IV Hydralazine.
   - hold antihypertensives while hypotensive; reintroduce medications
   slowly
   - Close monitoring as weaning sedation and pain medication
   #Agitation:   Previously managed well on PRN Haldol

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented to the ICU with gastrointestinal bleeding, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and hypotension. She has undergone cardiac surgery, including coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement. She was initially extubated but required reintubation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. Her current medications include beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and proton pump inhibitors.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 116/52 mmHg, heart rate of 67 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her respiratory status is improved, with a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 342 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show stable hemoglobin and platelet counts, but her white blood cell count is slightly elevated. Her liver function tests are within normal limits, and her renal function is stable. Her electrolyte levels are normal, except for a slightly low calcium level.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still slightly low, and she may require further fluid boluses or vasopressor support to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still compromised, and she may require further optimization of her ventilator settings or consideration of non-invasive ventilation.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is still present, and she may require further management with proton pump inhibitors and platelet transfusions.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is still slightly low, and she may require further platelet transfusions or consideration of platelet aggregation inhibitors.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is still present, and she may require further optimization of her anticoagulation therapy and consideration of rate control medications.
6. Coronary artery disease: The patient's coronary artery disease is still present, and she may require further optimization of her cardiac medications and consideration of revascularization procedures.
7. Aortic valve replacement: The patient's aortic valve replacement is still present, and she may require further optimization of her anticoagulation therapy and consideration of valve replacement surgery.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's current condition is stable, but she still requires close monitoring and management of her various medical complications. She will require further optimization of her medications, including beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and proton pump inhibitors. She will also require further management of her gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and atrial fibrillation."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach ane PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem
   - optimiazing cardiac status with betablocker and CCB
 changed to IV
   yesterday
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Has blood tinged vomit yesterday.  Hct
   was stable in high 20
s.  GIU c/s obtained who agreeded that bleeding
   was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated inless GIB
   worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we
   want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they
   don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of
   4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - Restarted PPI yesterday
 with close monitoring of plt count
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable in 90-100
s.  Unclear cause. Possibiilties
   include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued for this
   reason; however, had to be restarted today in setting of potential GI
   bleed. Patient received plt transfusion 2 days ago with bump to 122
   from 65/  PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   - Restart tube feeds with predosing of Zofran from nausea
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Will need scope if bleeds with tube feeds
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - will change back to po dilt and carvediolol with tube feeds, titrate
   up as necessary
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Restarted carvediolol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   # Hypertension: Patient had elevated SBP's overnight  Was given an
   additional 5 mg IV metoprolol (in addition to 10 mg IV q6h), however
   her SBPs remained in the 180's to 190's (asymptomatic).  She was given
   10 mg IV hydralazine and her metoprolol was increased to 15 mg IV q6h.
   BP
s now in 120

   - Close monitoring as weaning sedation and pain medication
   - changed to po meds as above with prn hydralazine, titrate up as
   necessary
   #Agitation:   Was agitatioed last night at time of increaed bp
   recevied haldol with good effect
   -haldol prn for night time agitation
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach ane PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem
   - optimiazing cardiac status with betablocker and CCB
 changed to IV
   yesterday
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Has blood tinged vomit yesterday.  Hct
   was stable in high 20
s.  GIU c/s obtained who agreeded that bleeding
   was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated inless GIB
   worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we
   want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they
   don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of
   4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - Restarted PPI yesterday
 with close monitoring of plt count
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable in 90-100
s.  Unclear cause. Possibiilties
   include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued for this
   reason; however, had to be restarted today in setting of potential GI
   bleed. Patient received plt transfusion 2 days ago with bump to 122
   from 65/  PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   - Restart tube feeds with predosing of Zofran from nausea
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Will need scope if bleeds with tube feeds
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - will change back to po dilt and carvediolol with tube feeds, titrate
   up as necessary
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Restarted carvediolol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   # Hypertension: Patient had elevated SBP's overnight  Was given an
   additional 5 mg IV metoprolol (in addition to 10 mg IV q6h), however
   her SBPs remained in the 180's to 190's (asymptomatic).  She was given
   10 mg IV hydralazine and her metoprolol was increased to 15 mg IV q6h.
   BP
s now in 120
s-130
   - Close monitoring as weaning sedation and pain medication
   - changed to po meds as above with prn hydralazine, titrate up as
   necessary
   #Agitation:   Was agitatioed last night at time of increaed bp
   recevied haldol with good effect
   -haldol prn for night time agitation
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach ane PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem
   - optimiazing cardiac status with betablocker and CCB
 changed to IV
   yesterday
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Has blood tinged vomit yesterday.  Hct
   was stable in high 20
s.  GIU c/s obtained who agreeded that bleeding
   was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated inless GIB
   worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we
   want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they
   don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of
   4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - Restarted PPI yesterday
 with close monitoring of plt count
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable in 90-100
s.  Unclear cause. Possibiilties
   include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued for this
   reason; however, had to be restarted today in setting of potential GI
   bleed. Patient received plt transfusion 2 days ago with bump to 122
   from 65/  PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   - Restart tube feeds with predosing of Zofran from nausea
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Will need scope if bleeds with tube feeds
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - will change back to po dilt and carvediolol with tube feeds, titrate
   up as necessary
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Restarted carvediolol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   # Hypertension: Patient had elevated SBP's overnight  Was given an
   additional 5 mg IV metoprolol (in addition to 10 mg IV q6h), however
   her SBPs remained in the 180's to 190's (asymptomatic).  She was given
   10 mg IV hydralazine and her metoprolol was increased to 15 mg IV q6h.
   BP
s now in 120

   #Agitation:   Was agitatioed last night at time of increaed bp
   recevied haldol with good effect
   -haldol prn for night time agitation
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and failure to extubate. She has undergone cardiac surgery, including coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement. The patient has been experiencing elevated blood pressures, and her platelet count has been stable in the range of 90-100. She has received transfusions of platelets and packed red blood cells.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has had blood-tinged vomit and has received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells. The bleeding may not be an acute issue, but it is essential to monitor her closely for any signs of worsening bleeding.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been stable in the range of 90-100, but it is unclear what is causing the thrombocytopenia. Possibilities include antibiotics or proton pump inhibitor (PPI) related, or underlying infection.
3. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial due to her underlying COPD, pneumonia, and cardiac status.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is currently rate-controlled with pain and anxiety control. She is not anticoagulated due to her recent gastrointestinal bleeding, but may need to be restarted on anticoagulation once her platelet count is stable and there is no evidence of ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures have been elevated, and she has received additional medication to control them. It is essential to continue monitoring her blood pressures closely to prevent further complications.
6. Agitation: The patient has been experiencing agitation, which may be related to her pain and anxiety. She has received haloperidol with good effect, and may need to be restarted on this medication if her agitation persists.
7. Back wound: The patient has a stage II ulcer on her back from a burn injury, and wound care has been provided. It is essential to continue monitoring her wound for signs of infection or further complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and platelet count closely.
2. Consider restarting anticoagulation once the patient's platelet count is stable and there is no evidence of ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Continue to optimize the patient's cardiac status with beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers.
4. Monitor the patient's blood pressures closely and adjust her medication as needed.
5. Continue to provide wound care for the patient's back wound.
6. Consider restarting the patient's proton pump inhibitor to help manage her acid reflux.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust her oxygen therapy as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPRIATORY FAILURE (failed extubation X 3)
 s/p Trach.  Hope to
   continue work towards weaning from mechanical ventilation.  Obstacles
   include underlying COPD and CAD (suspect component of cardiac
   ischemia).  Monitor progress, work towards trach collar trials.  Rehab
   screening in progress.
   COPD
 continue to optimized medical regimen.  Remains off steroids.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- concern for medication effect (Ativan provided
   at midnight) or CO2 retention.  Concern for new neurlogical event -->
   plan head CT to assess for intracranial bleed.
   ABD DISTENTION -- evidence for air in stomach and bowel, ?ileus.  PEG
   to gravity or suction to decompress.
   DIARRHEA -- check stool c. diff.
   ANEMIA
 Suspect related recent groin hematoma, and now predominately
   to phlebotomy.  Last PRBC transfusion [**2154-11-21**].  Monitor for eivdence of
   GI bleed.  Currently stable.
   GI BLEED
 coffee grounds possibly related to PEG, now resolved.  Need
   to monitor closely for GI bleed, as GI bleed was initial problem at
   time of transfer to [**Hospital1 54**].
   HYPTERTENSION -- resume and adjust PO meds --> need to
   SKIN BURN, BACK -- local care.
   GROIN HEMATOMA
 stable.  Monitor exam.
   CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIA -- a-fib/bradycardia/sinus pauses.  Sensitive to
   pharmacological agents.  Consider Cardiology consult to assist in
   mangement.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 contribution from antibiotics (zosyn?); HIT neg.
   Monitor plts count.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 TF on hold due to N/V.  Possible ileus based on
   CXR.  Would check KUB.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPRIATORY FAILURE (failed extubation X 3)
 s/p Trach.  Hope to
   continue work towards weaning from mechanical ventilation.  Obstacles
   include underlying COPD and CAD (suspect component of cardiac
   ischemia).  Monitor progress, work towards trach collar trials.  Rehab
   screening in progress.
   COPD
 continue to optimized medical regimen.  Remains off steroids.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- concern for medication effect (Ativan provided
   at midnight) or CO2 retention.  Concern for new neurlogical event -->
   plan head CT to assess for intracranial bleed.
   ABD DISTENTION -- evidence for air in stomach and bowel, ?ileus.  PEG
   to gravity or suction to decompress.
   DIARRHEA -- check stool c. diff.
   ANEMIA
 Suspect related recent groin hematoma, and now predominately
   to phlebotomy.  Last PRBC transfusion [**2154-11-21**].  Monitor for eivdence of
   GI bleed.  Currently stable.
   GI BLEED
 coffee grounds possibly related to PEG, now resolved.  Need
   to monitor closely for GI bleed, as GI bleed was initial problem at
   time of transfer to [**Hospital1 54**].
   HYPTERTENSION -- resume and adjust PO meds --> need to
   SKIN BURN, BACK -- local care.
   GROIN HEMATOMA
 stable.  Monitor exam.
   CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIA -- a-fib/bradycardia/sinus pauses.  Sensitive to
   pharmacological agents.  Consider Cardiology consult to assist in
   mangement.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 contribution from antibiotics (zosyn?); HIT neg.
   Monitor plts count.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 TF on hold due to N/V.  Possible ileus based on
   CXR.  Would check KUB.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient remains mechanically ventilated via tracheotomy tube and is experiencing respiratory failure. The patient's mental status has deteriorated, and they are more somnolent with difficulty arousing, which may be related to medication effect, CO2 retention, or a new neurological event. The patient's abdominal distension is likely due to air in the stomach and bowel, possibly indicating ileus. The patient has diarrhea, which may be related to Clostridioides difficile (C. diff). The patient has anemia, which is likely related to recent groin hematoma and phlebotomy. The patient's gastrointestinal (GI) bleed has resolved, but they need to be monitored closely for any signs of recurrent bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can worsen, leading to increased difficulty breathing, hypoxia, and potentially life-threatening respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac dysrhythmia: The patient's cardiac rhythm is sensitive to pharmacological agents, and they are at risk for developing life-threatening arrhythmias.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's GI bleed has resolved, but they need to be monitored closely for any signs of recurrent bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock, anemia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay increase their risk of developing infections, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and they are at risk for bleeding complications, including intracranial hemorrhage.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional support is compromised due to N/V, and they are at risk for developing malnutrition, which can lead to decreased immune function, impaired wound healing, and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Skin breakdown: The patient's skin is at risk for breakdown, particularly in the back, due to prolonged immobility and pressure.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and potential for new neurological events increase their risk for developing neurological complications, including stroke, seizure, and potentially life-threatening outcomes.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring their vital signs, respiratory status, and laboratory results closely. The patient's medical regimen should be optimized, and their nutritional support should be adjusted to address their compromised nutritional status. The patient's skin should be assessed regularly for signs of breakdown, and their risk for developing infections should be minimized through proper hygiene and antibiotic stewardship."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPRIATORY FAILURE (failed extubation X 3)
 s/p Trach.  Hope to
   continue work towards weaning from mechanical ventilation.  Obstacles
   include underlying COPD and CAD (suspect component of cardiac
   ischemia).  Monitor progress, work towards trach collar trials.  Rehab
   screening in progress.
   COPD
 continue to optimized medical regimen.  Remains off steroids.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- concern for medication effect (Ativan provided
   at midnight) or CO2 retention.  Concern for new neurlogical event -->
   plan head CT to assess for intracranial bleed.
   ABD DISTENTION -- evidence for air in stomach and bowel, ?ileus.  PEG
   to gravity or suction to decompress.
   DIARRHEA -- check stool c. diff.
   ANEMIA
 Suspect related recent groin hematoma, and now predominately
   to phlebotomy.  Last PRBC transfusion [**2154-11-21**].  Monitor for eivdence of
   GI bleed.  Currently stable.
   GI BLEED
 coffee grounds possibly related to PEG, now resolved.  Need
   to monitor closely for GI bleed, as GI bleed was initial problem at
   time of transfer to [**Hospital1 54**].
   HYPTERTENSION -- resume and adjust PO meds --> need to
   SKIN BURN, BACK -- local care.
   GROIN HEMATOMA
 stable.  Monitor exam.
   CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIA -- a-fib/bradycardia/sinus pauses.  Sensitive to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Respiratory failure, acute and chronic
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   24 Hour Events:
   Remains mechanically ventilated via tracheotomy tube.  Remained on IPS
   mode (IPS= 10, PEEP= 5)
   Experienced N/V with initiation of TF --> held
   Copius stool.
   Reduced UO responded to iv fluid bolus.
   This AM during rounds experienced abrupt reduction in mental status -->
   more somnulant, difficult to arrouse.  Moving all 4 extremeties,
   purposeful to painful stimuli.  Occured in context of relative
   hypotension (SBP <90 mmHg).  No significant improvement with resolving
   hypotension with iv fluid bolus.  Finger stick glucose OK.  SaO2 WNL.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypotension/MS changes: Pt had episode of MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7331**] yesterday
   morning associated with hypotension.  Does not appear to be septic
   physiology without fevers or positive culture data.  Responded to fluid
   boluses.  Head CT showed no acute intracranial pathology.
   - will given higher hold parameters for her antihypertensives
   - continue to monitor mental status
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach ane PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem
   - optimiazing cardiac status with betablocker and CCB
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Patient vomited yesterday, but no blood
   in the vomit.  Hct was stable at 30.8.  GIU c/s obtained who agreeded
   that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated
   inless GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG
   site if we want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen
   and they don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok
   with her getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a
   total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets decreased today to 61 from 81 (have
   been as low as 61 previously during this hospitalization and most
   recently as high as 122 after a plt transfusion.  Unclear cause.
   Possibiilties include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued
   for this reason; however, had to be restarted in setting of potential
   GI bleed. PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although she has been afebrile without clinical
   evidence of infection.
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Continue po dilt and carvedilol as her BP tolerates
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Restarted carvedilol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed.
   # Hypertension: Had been hypotensive yesterday in the am, so her
   medications were held.  This am she has SBP in the 180
s so her regular
   am meds were given.
   - Continue carvedilol and diltiazem as her BP tolerates.
   - Close monitoring as weaning sedation and pain medication
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and aortic valve replacement. She was admitted to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, and blood pressure of 161/69 mmHg. Her respiratory status is concerning, with a respiratory rate of 23 inspirations per minute and an oxygen saturation of 99%. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 356 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.8 x 10^9/L, a hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, and a platelet count of 61 x 10^9/L. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a potassium level of 4.1 mmol/L and a magnesium level of 1.9 mmol/L.

The patient's medical conditions are:

1. Hypotension/MS changes: The patient had an episode of mental status changes associated with hypotension, which responded to fluid boluses. She is being closely monitored for any further episodes.
2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to multifactorial causes including pneumonia, congestive heart failure, and underlying COPD.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient vomited yesterday, but no blood was present in the vomit. Her hemoglobin level is stable, and she has received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells. A scope is being considered to examine the PEG site.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased to 61 x 10^9/L, likely due to antibiotics or proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. She is being transfused with platelets and is being closely monitored for any signs of bleeding.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently rate-controlled with pain and anxiety management. She is not anticoagulated due to the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and mental status changes could be indicative of sepsis, which requires prompt recognition and treatment.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure could worsen, leading to respiratory arrest or death.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding could worsen, leading to hemodynamic instability and death.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia could worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation could worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and death.

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

1. Nutrition: Tube-feeding is being held due to nausea and vomiting.
2. Glycemic control: Regular insulin sliding scale is being used to control blood glucose levels.
3. Lines: The patient has a PICC line and is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for ventilator-associated pneumonia and stress ulcer.
5. Comments: The patient is being discussed on interdisciplinary rounds, and her code status is DNR."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypotension/MS changes: Pt had episode of MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7331**] yesterday
   morning associated with hypotension.  Does not appear to be septic
   physiology without fevers or positive culture data.  Responded to fluid
   boluses.  Head CT showed no acute intracranial pathology.   Now appears
   back to her baseline.
   - will give higher hold parameters for her antihypertensives
   - continue to monitor mental status
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem
   - optimizing cardiac status with betablocker and CCB
   - Will aim for 500 cc negative today.
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Patient vomited yesterday, but no blood
   in the vomit.  Hct was stable at 30.8.  GIU c/s obtained who agreeded
   that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated
   inless GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG
   site if we want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen
   and they don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok
   with her getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a
   total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets decreased today to 61 from 81 (have
   been as low as 61 previously during this hospitalization and most
   recently as high as 122 after a plt transfusion.  Unclear cause.
   Possibiilties include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued
   for this reason; however, had to be restarted in setting of potential
   GI bleed. [**Month (only) 60**] have also been secondary to zosyn, however this was
   stopped days ago.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other
   etiologies include infection, although she has been afebrile without
   clinical evidence of infection, or consumption.
   - Will check a peripheral smear.
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 10
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - Will have hematology consult given presistent thrombocytopenia
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Continue po dilt and carvedilol as her BP tolerates
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Restarted carvedilol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed.
   # Hypertension: Had been hypotensive yesterday in the am, so her
   medications were held.  This am she has SBP in the 180
s so her regular
   am meds were given.
   - Continue carvedilol and diltiazem as her BP tolerates with higher
   holding parameters.
   - Close monitoring as weaning sedation and pain medication
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypotension/MS changes: Pt had episode of MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7331**] yesterday
   morning associated with hypotension.  Does not appear to be septic
   physiology without fevers or positive culture data.  Responded to fluid
   boluses.  Head CT showed no acute intracranial pathology.   Now appears
   back to her baseline.
   - will give higher hold parameters for her antihypertensives
   - continue to monitor mental status
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem
   - optimizing cardiac status with betablocker and CCB
   - Will aim for 500 cc negative today.
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Patient vomited yesterday, but no blood
   in the vomit.  Hct was stable at 30.8.  GIU c/s obtained who agreeded
   that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated
   inless GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG
   site if we want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen
   and they don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok
   with her getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a
   total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets decreased today to 61 from 81 (have
   been as low as 61 previously during this hospitalization and most
   recently as high as 122 after a plt transfusion.  Unclear cause.
   Possibiilties include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued
   for this reason; however, had to be restarted in setting of potential
   GI bleed. [**Month (only) 60**] have also been secondary to zosyn, however this was
   stopped days ago.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other
   etiologies include infection, although she has been afebrile without
   clinical evidence of infection, or consumption.
   - Will check a peripheral smear.
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 10
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - Will have hematology consult given presistent thrombocytopenia
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Continue po dilt and carvedilol as her BP tolerates
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Restarted carvedilol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed.
   # Hypertension: Had been hypotensive yesterday in the am, so her
   medications were held.  This am she has SBP in the 180
s so her regular
   am meds were given.
   - Continue carvedilol and diltiazem as her BP tolerates with higher
   holding parameters.
   - Close monitoring as weaning sedation and pain medication
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.1°C, heart rate 70 bpm, blood pressure 161/69 mmHg, respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99%.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 356 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation, and is currently receiving antihypertensive medications.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient vomited yesterday, but no blood was present in the vomit. Her hemoglobin level is stable at 30.8 g/dL.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased to 61 x 10^9/L, and is being monitored.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently rate-controlled and is not anticoagulated.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure can worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding can worsen, leading to further bleeding and potential complications.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can worsen, leading to increased risk of bleeding and potential complications.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and history of coronary artery disease can lead to cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
* Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state can increase her risk of infection.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust mechanical ventilation as necessary.
* Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and adjust treatment as necessary.
* Monitor the patient's thrombocytopenia and adjust treatment as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust treatment as necessary.
* Consider restarting anticoagulation therapy once the patient's platelet count is stable and there is no evidence of ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Consider consulting with a hematology specialist to assist with management of the patient's thrombocytopenia.
* Continue to monitor the patient's infection risk and adjust treatment as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they
   don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of
   4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable in 90-100
s.  Unclear cause. Possibiilties
   include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued for this
   reason; however, had to be restarted today in setting of potential GI
   bleed. Patient received plt transfusion 2 days ago with bump to 122
   from 65/  PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   - Restart tube feeds with predosing of Zofran from nausea
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Will need scope if bleeds with tube feeds
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - will change back to po dilt and carvediolol with tube feeds, titrate
   up as necessary
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a tracheostomy and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.

The patient's 24-hour events include:

* Nausea and vomiting, which led to a tube being placed to suction and later clamped
* A computed tomography (CT) head scan showed no bleeding or pathology
* The patient's blood pressure was in the 100s-120 systolic, so antihypertensive medications were held
* A C. difficile test was ordered

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (96.9°F)
* Heart rate: 70 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 161/69 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.8 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 26.3%
* Platelet count: 65 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 32 mg/dL
* Glucose: 108 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.8 mmol/L

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Hypotension/Myocardial stunning: The patient had an episode of hypotension and myocardial stunning, which was managed with fluid boluses.
* Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure and was reintubated in the ICU.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has had blood-tongued vomit and has received 4 units of packed red blood cells.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a platelet count of 65 x 10^9/L and has received a platelet transfusion.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently rate-controlled.
* Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
* Aortic valve replacement: The patient has a bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement.

Potential medical complications:

* Hypotension/Myocardial stunning: The patient may experience further episodes of hypotension and myocardial stunning, which could lead to cardiac complications.
* Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient may experience further episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure, which could lead to respiratory complications.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient may experience further episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to bleeding complications.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient may experience further episodes of thrombocytopenia, which could lead to bleeding complications.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient may experience further episodes of atrial fibrillation, which could lead to cardiac complications.
* Coronary artery disease: The patient may experience further episodes of coronary artery disease, which could lead to cardiac complications.
* Aortic valve replacement: The patient may experience further complications related to the bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement, such as valve failure or thrombosis."

   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets decreased today to 61 from 81 (have
   been as low as 61 previously during this hospitalization and most
   recently as high as 122 after a plt transfusion.  Unclear cause.
   Possibiilties include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued
   for this reason; however, had to be restarted in setting of potential
   GI bleed. [**Month (only) 60**] have also been secondary to zosyn, however this was
   stopped days ago.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other
   etiologies include infection, although she has been afebrile without

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and hypotension. She had a previous episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which was rate-controlled with medication. She has also been experiencing thrombocytopenia, which is currently being managed with platelet transfusions.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (96.9°F)
* Heart rate: 70 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 161/69 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 61 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 6.8 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 108 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.8 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.5 g/dL
* LDH: 284 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.5 mg/dL

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. She has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement.

Potential medical complications:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is currently low, which may increase the risk of bleeding. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the cause of thrombocytopenia.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and non-invasive ventilation may be necessary to improve oxygenation.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may recur, and further evaluation and management are needed to determine the cause and prevent future episodes.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if not properly managed. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the cause and prevent future episodes.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if not properly managed. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the cause and prevent future episodes.
6. Coronary artery disease: The patient's coronary artery disease may worsen if not properly managed. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the cause and prevent future episodes.
7. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: The patient's COPD may worsen if not properly managed. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the cause and prevent future episodes."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - TF were restarted, however she had some nausea and abominal
   fullness.  She was also started on reglan.  Given simethicone and
   zofran with decrease in her nausea so she was restarted on tube feeds
   again.
   - Heme-onc evaluated her for her persistent thrombocytopenia and
   recommended resending HIT Ab test and thought her thromboyctopenia may
   have been drug related as it appears she has had it to the 60's as long
   ago as [**2147**].  Their most likely candidates included simvastatin and
   diltiazem.  Simvastatin was stopped.
   - Her holding parameters were increased for her BP meds given her
   hypotension yesterday.
   - She was 1 L positive and her SBP's were elevated in the 170's so she
   was given 10 mg IV lasix (goal of 500 cc neg).
   - Had SBPs in the 180's overnight, asymptomatic.  Was given 10 mg of po
   hydralazine.  Her SBP went to the 200's shortly after and she was given
   10 mg of IV hydralazine with improvement of her pressures back to the
   180s and then later to the 140s.  Also changed her po dilt to 15 mg po

   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypotension/MS changes: Pt had episode of MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7331**] yesterday
   morning associated with hypotension.  Does not appear to be septic
   physiology without fevers or positive culture data.  Responded to fluid
   boluses.  Head CT showed no acute intracranial pathology.   Now appears
   back to her baseline.
   - will give higher hold parameters for her antihypertensives
   - continue to monitor mental status
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem
   - optimizing cardiac status with betablocker and CCB
   - Will aim for 500 cc negative today.
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Patient vomited yesterday, but no blood
   in the vomit.  Hct was stable at 30.8.  GIU c/s obtained who agreeded
   that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated
   inless GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG
   site if we want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen
   and they don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok
   with her getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a
   total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets decreased today to 61 from 81 (have
   been as low as 61 previously during this hospitalization and most
   recently as high as 122 after a plt transfusion.  Unclear cause.
   Possibiilties include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued
   for this reason; however, had to be restarted in setting of potential
   GI bleed. [**Month (only) 60**] have also been secondary to zosyn, however this was
   stopped days ago.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other
   etiologies include infection, although she has been afebrile without
   clinical evidence of infection, or consumption.
   - Will check a peripheral smear.
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 10
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - Will have hematology consult given presistent thrombocytopenia
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Continue po dilt and carvedilol as her BP tolerates
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Restarted carvedilol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed.
   # Hypertension: Had been hypotensive yesterday in the am, so her
   medications were held.  This am she has SBP in the 180
s so her regular
   am meds were given.
   - Continue carvedilol and diltiazem as her BP tolerates with higher
   holding parameters.
   - Close monitoring as weaning sedation and pain medication
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - TF were restarted, however she had some nausea and abominal
   fullness.  She was also started on reglan.  Given simethicone and
   zofran with decrease in her nausea so she was restarted on tube feeds
   again.
   - Heme-onc evaluated her for her persistent thrombocytopenia and
   recommended resending HIT Ab test and thought her thromboyctopenia may
   have been drug related as it appears she has had it to the 60's as long
   ago as [**2147**].  Their most likely candidates included simvastatin and
   diltiazem.  Simvastatin was stopped.
   - Her holding parameters were increased for her BP meds given her
   hypotension yesterday.
   - She was 1 L positive and her SBP's were elevated in the 170's so she
   was given 10 mg IV lasix (goal of 500 cc neg).
   - Had SBPs in the 180's overnight, asymptomatic.  Was given 10 mg of po
   hydralazine.  Her SBP went to the 200's shortly after and she was given
   10 mg of IV hydralazine with improvement of her pressures back to the
   180s and then later to the 140s.  Also changed her po dilt to 15 mg po
   qid (from tid).

She is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.8°C, heart rate 93 bpm, blood pressure 143/18 mmHg, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient has been treated for hypotension with fluid boluses and is currently being monitored for cardiac status.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and is being managed for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, but the current bleeding episode appears to be stable, and a scope has been recommended to examine the PEG site.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased to 61, and the cause is unclear. Possibilities include antibiotics, PPI-related, or infection.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently rate-controlled, and anticoagulation has been held due to the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and she is at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.
* Respiratory complications: The patient is at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or respiratory failure.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.
* Thrombotic complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia increases her risk for thrombotic complications such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
* Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised, and she is at risk for infection, particularly pneumonia or sepsis.

Based on the patient's current condition, the following actions should be taken:

* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust her antihypertensive medications as needed.
* Optimize her respiratory support and manage her hypercarbic respiratory failure.
* Continue to monitor her gastrointestinal bleeding and consider a scope to examine the PEG site.
* Trend her platelet count and consider transfusion if necessary.
* Monitor her for signs of infection and adjust her antibiotic regimen as needed.
* Consider restarting anticoagulation once her platelet count is stable and there is no evidence of ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - TF were restarted, however she had some nausea and abominal
   fullness.  She was also started on reglan.  Given simethicone and
   zofran with decrease in her nausea so she was restarted on tube feeds
   again.
   - Heme-onc evaluated her for her persistent thrombocytopenia and
   recommended resending HIT Ab test and thought her thromboyctopenia may
   have been drug related as it appears she has had it to the 60's as long
   ago as [**2147**].  Their most likely candidates included simvastatin and
   diltiazem.  Simvastatin was stopped.
   - Her holding parameters were increased for her BP meds given her
   hypotension yesterday.
   - She was 1 L positive and her SBP's were elevated in the 170's so she
   was given 10 mg IV lasix (goal of 500 cc neg).
   - Had SBPs in the 180's overnight, asymptomatic.  Was given 10 mg of po
   hydralazine.  Her SBP went to the 200's shortly after and she was given
   10 mg of IV hydralazine with improvement of her pressures back to the
   180s and then later to the 140s.  Also changed her po dilt to 15 mg po
   qid (from tid).

   # Hypotension/MS changes:Improving. Pt had episode of MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7331**]
   2 days ago morning associated with hypotension.  Does not appear to be
   septic physiology without fevers or positive culture data.  Responded
   to fluid boluses.  Head CT showed no acute intracranial pathology.
   Sommnolent this morning, but arousable, appeared very drowsy, got 1mg
   ativan at midnight likely causing this.
   - will give higher hold parameters for her antihypertensives
   - continue to monitor mental status
   - d/c ativan as not good medication in eldery
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely

   - optimizing cardiac status with betablocker and CCB
   - Will aim for 500 cc negative today, was (+) 1.5 L yesterday, CXR
   looks volume overloaded
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   - SBT today with goal to come off vent onto trach mask
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  No vomiting in >24 hours.  Hct was stable
   at 31.6.  GI c/s obtained who agreeded that bleeding was not an acute
   issue and emergent scope not indicated inless GIB worsened.    IP
   offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we want this (however
   this would not examine the entire abdomen and they don't think the
   blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her getting a scope
   if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets decreased today to 57 from 61 (have
   been as low as 61 previously during this hospitalization and most
   recently as high as 122 after a plt transfusion.  Unclear cause.
   Possibiilties include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued
   for this reason; however, had to be restarted in setting of potential
   GI bleed. [**Month (only) 60**] have also been secondary to zosyn, however this was
   stopped days ago.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other
   etiologies include infection, although she has been afebrile without
   clinical evidence of infection, or consumption.  Per heme onc recs,
   likely chronic in nature, as far back at [**2151**].  Probably drug related,
   statin vs. diltiazem

   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - heme/onc following, appreciate recs
   - Guaiac all stools
   - HIT antibody pending
   # Hypertension: Hypertensive as high as 205 overnight, responded well
   to IV hydralizine.  SBP
s this morning in 140
   - Continue carvedilol and diltiazem as her BP tolerates with higher
   holding parameters.
   - diltiazem increased to 15mg qid
   - increase carvedilol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], will increase to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] tomorrow if
   continues to be hypertensive
   - Close monitoring as weaning sedation and pain medication
   # Leukopenia: 3.9 this morning (7.1

   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Continue po dilt and carvedilol and increase as above
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - simvastatin per heme/onc recs
   - Restarted carvedilol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  No vomiting in >24 hours.  Hct was stable
   at 31.6.  GI c/s obtained who agreeded that bleeding was not an acute
   issue and emergent scope not indicated inless GIB worsened.    IP
   offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we want this (however
   this would not examine the entire abdomen and they don't think the
   blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her getting a scope
   if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets decreased today to 57 from 61 (have
   been as low as 61 previously during this hospitalization and most
   recently as high as 122 after a plt transfusion.  Unclear cause.
   Possibiilties include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued
   for this reason; however, had to be restarted in setting of potential
   GI bleed. [**Month (only) 60**] have also been secondary to zosyn, however this was
   stopped days ago.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other
   etiologies include infection, although she has been afebrile without
   clinical evidence of infection, or consumption.  Per heme onc recs,
   likely chronic in nature, as far back at [**2151**].  Probably drug related,
   statin vs. diltiazem

 screening for respiratory rehab<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, COPD, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, and blood pressure of 143/18 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 98% on a FiO2 of 35%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.2 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 57 x 10^9/L. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L.

The patient's medications include pantoprazole, furosemide, lorazepam, and simvastatin, which was stopped due to concerns about thrombocytopenia. She is also receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin.

The patient's medical conditions include hypotension, hypercarbic respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and atrial fibrillation. She is at risk for complications such as sepsis, pneumonia, and deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's plan of care includes optimizing her cardiac status with beta blockers and calcium channel blockers, continuing her anticoagulation therapy, and monitoring her platelet count. She is also receiving prophylaxis for stress ulcer and deep vein thrombosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be indicative of sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and hypoxemia may increase her risk of developing pneumonia, which can be a life-threatening complication.
3. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and immobilization may increase her risk of developing deep vein thrombosis, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and death.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may continue to worsen, leading to hemorrhagic shock and death.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to bleeding complications and death.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and death.
7. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and death.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her medical conditions to prevent complications and improve her outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 30 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including CAD, s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD, who was admitted to the ICU for management of GI bleed and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has failed to extubate three times while admitted.

The patient's current vital signs include:

* T-max: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* T-current: 35.8°C (96.5°F)
* HR: 75 (54-93) bpm
* BP: 116/45 (60) mmHg
* RR: 19 (15-26) inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 98%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus Rhythm

The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV with a VT of 400 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR of 29, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 35%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 4.2-7.7 K/uL
* Hct: 24.9-32.5%
* Plt: 61-122 K/uL
* Cr: 0.8-1.1 mg/dL
* TCO2: 32 mmHg
* Glucose: 67-120 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 12.2/28.7/1.0, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 36/2/0.20, ALT/AST: 6-19, Alk Phos/T Bili: 43/0.3, Differential-Neuts: 90.5%, Band: 0.0%, Lymph: 4.7%, Mono: 4.5%, Eos: 0.2%, Fibrinogen: 105 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 0.8 mmol/L, Albumin: 3.5 g/dL, LDH: 284 IU/L, Ca++: 9.2 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL, PO4: 2.4 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Mental status changes: Use Haldol prn rather than benzodiazepines for agitation.
* Respiratory failure: SBT trial today and possible change to trach mask. Continue Advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, and steroids.
* GI bleed: Maintain active type and screen, PICC access, and transfusion goal > 25. Continue PPI.
* Thrombocytopenia: Has been chronic; per Heme svc, HIT sent, dilt and statin dc'd. Smear pending.
* AFIB: On carvedilol, holding anticoag for GIB.
* CAD s/p CABG: Statin dc'd per Heme, cont BB, holding ASA for GIB.
* HTN: Elevated BP o/n. Continue carvedilol as BP tolerates with higher holding parameters.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: Prolonged mechanical ventilation, respiratory acidosis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
* GI bleed: Hemorrhagic shock, coagulopathy, and sepsis.
* Thrombocytopenia: Bleeding complications, such as epistaxis, hematuria, or hematemesis.
* AFIB: Cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, and cardiac arrest.
* CAD s/p CABG: Myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
* HTN: Cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and hypertensive crisis.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her condition to prevent or minimize these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's current condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CAD, s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD, who is critically ill and admitted to the ICU for management of GI bleed and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
* She has failed extubation three times and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.
* Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 116/45 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%.
* She has a tracheostomy tube in place and is receiving oxygen therapy.
* Her laboratory results show chronic thrombocytopenia, and she is at risk of bleeding.
* She has a history of AFIB and is on carvedilol, which is being held due to GI bleed.
* She has a history of CAD and is on statin therapy, which is being held due to GI bleed.
* She has hypertension and is being treated with carvedilol.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she is at risk of further deterioration. She may require more aggressive respiratory support, such as high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
* Bleeding: The patient's chronic thrombocytopenia and history of GI bleed make her at risk of further bleeding. She may require platelet transfusions and/or anticoagulation therapy.
* Sepsis: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of indwelling lines and catheters make her at risk of developing sepsis.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and AFIB make her at risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of GI bleed and chronic gastrointestinal disease make her at risk of further gastrointestinal complications, such as perforation or obstruction.
* Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to eat and her history of chronic gastrointestinal disease make her at risk of developing nutritional deficiencies, such as malnutrition or electrolyte imbalances.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill and at risk of developing multiple medical complications. She requires close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent further deterioration and improve her chances of recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and hypertension. She has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR) and has been experiencing episodes of hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 94 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a tracheostomy tube. Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.6, hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 57.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and COPD, and she has been taking medications for these conditions. She has also undergone a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for nutrition.

The patient's current medications include carvedilol, diltiazem, and lisinopril, and she has been receiving infusions of pantoprazole and hydralizine. She has also received a transfusion of 4 units of packed red blood cells and has been receiving platelet transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and she may require further medication adjustments to control her hypertension.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, and she may require further management of her respiratory status.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is ongoing, and she may require further management of her bleeding.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and she may require further transfusions to manage her bleeding.
5. Leukopenia: The patient's white blood cell count is low, and she may be at risk for infection.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is ongoing, and she may require further management of her arrhythmia.
7. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's coronary artery disease is ongoing, and she may require further management of her cardiovascular status.
8. Skin Integrity: The patient has a stage II ulcer on her back from a burn injury, and she may require further wound care management.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results to ensure that her hypertension, respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding are under control.
2. Adjust the patient's medications as needed to control her hypertension and atrial fibrillation.
3. Continue to provide mechanical ventilation to the patient until her respiratory status improves.
4. Consider transferring the patient to a higher level of care if her condition does not improve.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and transfuse as needed to manage her bleeding.
6. Consider restarting coumadin once the patient's platelet count is stable and there is no evidence of ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's white blood cell count and consider starting antibiotics if her count remains low.
8. Continue to manage the patient's skin ulcer and consider transferring her to a wound care center if necessary."

   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  No vomiting in >24 hours.  Hct was stable
   at 31.6.  GI c/s obtained who agreeded that bleeding was not an acute
   issue and emergent scope not indicated inless GIB worsened.    IP
   offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we want this (however
   this would not examine the entire abdomen and they don't think the
   blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her getting a scope
   if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented to the hospital with gastrointestinal bleeding, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and hypertension. She was previously intubated three times due to respiratory failure and was extubated once, only to be reintubated due to worsening respiratory status.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 35.6°C (96°F)
* Heart rate: 94 bpm (71-100 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 140/64 mmHg (82-103 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 22 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 98%

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including:

* Hypertension, which is being managed with IV hydralizine and increased carvedilol and diltiazem doses
* Atrial fibrillation, which is being rate-controlled with po dilt and carvedilol
* Gastrointestinal bleeding, which is being monitored and treated with PPI and transfusions
* Thrombocytopenia, which is being managed with platelet transfusions and holding anticoagulation medications
* Leukopenia, which is being monitored and treated with antibiotics and pain management
* Coronary artery disease, which is being managed with simvastatin and restarting ASA once platelets are stable

The patient has several potential medical complications that could arise, including:

* Respiratory failure, which could worsen if the patient's respiratory status does not improve
* Gastrointestinal bleeding, which could worsen if the patient's bleeding does not stop
* Thrombocytopenia, which could lead to bleeding if the patient's platelet count does not improve
* Leukopenia, which could lead to infections if the patient's white blood cell count does not improve
* Hypertension, which could lead to cardiac complications if not managed properly
* Atrial fibrillation, which could lead to stroke or cardiac arrest if not managed properly

The patient's current medications include:

* Carvedilol
* Diltiazem
* IV hydralizine
* PPI
* Vancomycin/Meropenem (completed 8-day course)
* Simvastatin
* ASA (holding due to thrombocytopenia)
* Coumadin (holding due to GI bleed)

The patient's laboratory results include:

* Hemoglobin: 10.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 48,000/μL
* White blood cell count: 3.9 x 10^9/L
* Blood urea nitrogen: 30 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 67 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.8 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.5 g/dL
* LDH: 284 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.6 mg/dL

The patient's current ICU care includes:

* Nutrition: Glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale
* Lines: PICC line
* Prophylaxis: DVT, stress ulcer, VAP
* Comments: The patient's family is aware of her code status and has discussed her care with the healthcare team."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and hypertension. She has undergone a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and has received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells. Her platelet count has been decreasing and is currently at 48. She has also been experiencing hypertension, which has responded well to IV hydralizine.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypotension and decreased platelet count may increase her risk of bleeding, which could lead to hypotension.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypercarbic respiratory failure may increase her risk of respiratory failure.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to further bleeding complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's decreasing platelet count may increase her risk of bleeding and may require further transfusions.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may require further management, including adjustments to her medication regimen and close monitoring of her blood pressure.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may require further management, including anticoagulation therapy and close monitoring of her cardiac status.
7. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's history of coronary artery disease may increase her risk of cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest.
8. Back Wound: The patient's stage II ulcer on her back may increase her risk of infection and may require further wound care and management.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's mental status has improved following the discontinuation of Ativan, and she is currently alert and able to communicate with hand signals. Her respiratory status remains a concern, and she will continue to be monitored closely. Her gastrointestinal bleeding has been stabilized, and she will continue to receive supportive care. Her hypertension will be managed with IV hydralizine and carvedilol, and her platelet count will be trended regularly. Her atrial fibrillation will be managed with rate control and anticoagulation therapy as indicated. Her coronary artery disease will be managed with close monitoring of her cardiac status and consideration of further interventions as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Continuing statin therapy
* Holding aspirin for gastrointestinal bleed
* Transfusing platelets if platelet count is <20 K/uL
* Monitoring for thrombocytopenia
* Managing atrial fibrillation with carvedilol and possible cardioversion
* Managing hypertension with carvedilol and lisinopril
* Managing respiratory failure with non-invasive ventilation and possible tracheostomy
* Managing gastrointestinal bleed with conservative management and possible endoscopy
* Managing thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions and possible splenectomy

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   she was noted to a little somnelent and hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was
   then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10, PEEP 5). Will again attempt
   transition to trach mask.
   - Trial trach mask again today
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  No vomiting in >48 hours.  Hct is
   currently stable at 29.6 today.  GI c/s obtained who agreeded that
   bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated inless
   GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we
   want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they
   don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of
   4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets continued to decrease to a level of
   46 from 48 (have been as low as 61 previously during this
   hospitalization and most recently as high as 122 after a plt
   transfusion.  Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as far back
   at [**2151**]. Appreciate heme onc recs will start pt on Vitamin B12
   supplementation whilst awaiting MMA given low normal B12 levels.
   Discussed with pt
s son who is the healthcare proxy yesterday regarding
   the possibility of a bone marrow biopsy which he agreed to. UPEP, SPEP,
   MMA, peripheral smear have been collected and are currently pending.
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - UPEP, SPEP, MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - Guaiac all stools
   - HIT antibody x 1 negative, other study is pending
   # Hypertension: Hypertensive as high as 205 overnight, responded well
   to IV hydralizine.  SBP
s this morning in 140
   - Continue carvedilol and diltiazem as her BP tolerates with higher
   holding parameters.
   - carvedilol currently at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], will consider increasing to 25mg
   [**Hospital1 **] if she continues to be hypertensive
   - Close monitoring as weaning sedation and pain medication
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol
   - Consider restarting coumadin once pt has undergone bone marrow biopsy
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Restarted carvedilol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who presented to the hospital with gastrointestinal bleeding, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and oliguria/anuria. She was initially extubated but required reintubation due to respiratory failure. She has a tracheostomy and PEG tube in place. Her laboratory results show a platelet count of 46, which is considered thrombocytopenia, and her creatinine level is stable at 0.8 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Oliguria/anuria: The patient's urine output is poor, and her creatinine level is stable, which suggests that she may be experiencing hypovolemia. Close monitoring of her fluid status and urine output is essential to prevent further decline in kidney function.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of her platelet count and transfusion goal is essential to prevent bleeding complications.
3. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, and close monitoring of her respiratory status is essential to prevent further decline in lung function.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is not acute, and close monitoring of her bleeding status is essential to prevent further bleeding.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but close monitoring is essential to prevent further hypertension.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled, but close monitoring is essential to prevent further arrhythmias.
7. Coronary artery disease: The patient's coronary artery disease is stable, but close monitoring is essential to prevent further cardiac complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's urine output and creatinine level to assess her fluid status and kidney function.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and transfusion goal to prevent bleeding complications.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status to prevent further decline in lung function.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding status to prevent further bleeding.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure to prevent further hypertension.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation to prevent further arrhythmias.
7. Consider restarting coumadin once the patient has undergone bone marrow biopsy to prevent further thrombotic complications.
8. Consider restarting ASA once the patient's platelets are stable and there is no evidence of ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding to prevent further cardiovascular complications."

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 whilst admitted
   currently on minimal pressure support via trach and decreased urinary
   output.
   # Oliguria: Over the past 24 hours has been 17cc/hr since MN. Cr stable
   at 0.8.  likely [**12-23**] hypovolemia though other vitals are stable.
   Received fluids overnight with increase in UOP.  UA grossly positive.
   Ucx from [**11-25**] with >100,000 yeast, likely colonization.
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine and monitor UOP
   - start empiric cipro for total of 7 days to end on [**2153-12-4**], await ucx
   sensitivities
   - goal UOP >30cc/hr
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was trialed on a trach mask however
   she was noted to a little somnelent and hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was
   then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10, PEEP 5). Will again attempt
   transition to trach mask.
   - Trial trach mask again today
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:   Hct stable for 4 days.   No vomiting in
   >48 hours.  Hct is currently stable at 29.6 today.  GI c/s obtained who
   agreeded that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not
   indicated inless GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at
   the PEG site if we want this (however this would not examine the entire
   abdomen and they don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her
   family is ok with her getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has
   recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets continued to decrease to a level of
   46 from 48 (have been as low as 61 previously during this
   hospitalization and most recently as high as 122 after a plt
   transfusion.  Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as far back
   at [**2151**]. Appreciate heme onc recs will start pt on Vitamin B12
   supplementation whilst awaiting MMA given low normal B12 levels.
   Discussed with pt
s son who is the healthcare proxy yesterday regarding
   the possibility of a [**Year (4 digits) 793**] [**Year (4 digits) **] biopsy which he agreed to. UPEP, SPEP,
   MMA, peripheral smear have been collected and are currently pending.
   - heme onc following, appreciate recs
 plan for [**Year (4 digits) 793**] [**Year (4 digits) **] bx,
   possibly today
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - UPEP, SPEP, MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - Guaiac all stools
   - HIT antibody x 1 negative, other study is pending
   # Hypertension: No iv medication required overnight for first time in a
   week.  Max bp 160
s.  Was started on lisinopril 5mg qd yesterday.
   Carvedilol increased to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] yesterday.
   - Continue carvedilol, diltiazem and lisinopril, titrate up ACE-I as
   needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting coumadin once pt has undergone [**Hospital1 793**] [**Hospital1 **] biopsy
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a recent gastrointestinal bleed. She is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of respiratory failure and oliguria.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), heart rate of 60 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 115/62 mmHg. She is intubated and receiving minimal pressure support via a tracheostomy tube. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.2 × 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 46 × 10^9/L. Her creatinine level is 0.8 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 27 mg/dL. Her liver function tests are normal, and her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's medical conditions include oliguria, hypercarbic respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. She has undergone a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR).

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Progressive oliguria and acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypovolemia and potential sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure and worsening hypercarbia due to inadequate ventilation and potential pneumonia.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding and potential perforation due to ongoing bleeding and potential sepsis.
4. Thrombocytopenia and potential bleeding due to platelet dysfunction and potential sepsis.
5. Hypertension and potential cardiac complications due to inadequate blood pressure control and potential cardiac ischemia.
6. Atrial fibrillation and potential cardiac complications due to inadequate rate control and potential cardiac ischemia.
7. Infection and potential sepsis due to ongoing bleeding and potential pneumonia.
8. Wound complications due to the patient's back wound and potential skin thinning.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue to trend creatinine and monitor urine output.
2. Start empiric ciprofloxacin for 7 days to cover potential urinary tract infection.
3. Trial tracheostomy mask again today to assess for potential extubation.
4. Continue advair, ipratropium, and home xopenex for respiratory support.
5. Maintain active type and screen, PICC access, and transfusion goal of >25.
6. Consider restarting coumadin once the patient has undergone a biopsy.
7. Continue carvedilol and diltiazem for hypertension and atrial fibrillation control.
8. Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of ongoing GI bleed.
9. Continue wound care and dressings per recommendations.
10. Monitor for potential complications and adjust plan of care as necessary."

   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 whilst admitted
   currently on minimal pressure support via trach and decreased urinary
   output.
   # Low Urine Output: Over the past 24 hours has been 17cc/hr since MN.
   Cr stable at 0.8.  likely [**12-23**] hypovolemia though other vitals are
   stable.  Received fluids overnight with increase in UOP.  UA grossly
   positive. Ucx from [**11-25**] with >100,000 yeast, likely colonization.
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine and monitor UOP
   - start empiric cipro, await ucx sensitivities
   - goal UOP >30cc/hr
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was trialed on a trach mask however
   she was noted to a little somnelent and hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was
   then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10, PEEP 5). Will again attempt
   transition to trach mask.
   - Trial trach mask again today
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Hct  No vomiting in >48 hours.  Hct is
   currently stable at 29.6 today.  GI c/s obtained who agreeded that
   bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated inless
   GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we
   want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they
   don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of
   4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets continued to decrease to a level of
   46 from 48 (have been as low as 61 previously during this
   hospitalization and most recently as high as 122 after a plt
   transfusion.  Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as far back
   at [**2151**]. Appreciate heme onc recs will start pt on Vitamin B12
   supplementation whilst awaiting MMA given low normal B12 levels.
   Discussed with pt
s son who is the healthcare proxy yesterday regarding
   the possibility of a [**Year (4 digits) 793**] [**Year (4 digits) **] biopsy which he agreed to. UPEP, SPEP,
   MMA, peripheral smear have been collected and are currently pending.
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - UPEP, SPEP, MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - Guaiac all stools
   - HIT antibody x 1 negative, other study is pending
   # Hypertension: Hypertensive as high as 205 overnight, responded well
   to IV hydralizine.  SBP
s this morning in 140
   - Continue carvedilol and diltiazem as her BP tolerates with higher
   holding parameters.
   - carvedilol currently at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], will consider increasing to 25mg
   [**Hospital1 **] if she continues to be hypertensive
   - Close monitoring as weaning sedation and pain medication
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol
   - Consider restarting coumadin once pt has undergone [**Hospital1 793**] [**Hospital1 **] biopsy
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Restarted carvedilol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 whilst admitted
   currently on minimal pressure support via trach and decreased urinary
   output.
   # Low Urine Output: Over the past 24 hours has been 17cc/hr since MN.
   Cr stable at 0.8.  likely [**12-23**] hypovolemia though other vitals are
   stable.  Received fluids overnight with increase in UOP.  UA grossly
   positive. Ucx from [**11-25**] with >100,000 yeast, likely colonization.
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine and monitor UOP
   - start empiric cipro, await ucx sensitivities
   - goal UOP >30cc/hr
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was trialed on a trach mask however
   she was noted to a little somnelent and hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was
   then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10, PEEP 5). Will again attempt
   transition to trach mask.
   - Trial trach mask again today
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Hct  No vomiting in >48 hours.  Hct is
   currently stable at 29.6 today.  GI c/s obtained who agreeded that
   bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated inless
   GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we
   want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they
   don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of
   4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets continued to decrease to a level of
   46 from 48 (have been as low as 61 previously during this
   hospitalization and most recently as high as 122 after a plt
   transfusion.  Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as far back
   at [**2151**]. Appreciate heme onc recs will start pt on Vitamin B12
   supplementation whilst awaiting MMA given low normal B12 levels.
   Discussed with pt
s son who is the healthcare proxy yesterday regarding
   the possibility of a [**Year (4 digits) 793**] [**Year (4 digits) **] biopsy which he agreed to. UPEP, SPEP,
   MMA, peripheral smear have been collected and are currently pending.
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - UPEP, SPEP, MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - Guaiac all stools
   - HIT antibody x 1 negative, other study is pending
   # Hypertension: Hypertensive as high as 205 overnight, responded well
   to IV hydralizine.  SBP
s this morning in 140
   - Continue carvedilol and diltiazem as her BP tolerates with higher
   holding parameters.
   - carvedilol currently at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], will consider increasing to 25mg
   [**Hospital1 **] if she continues to be hypertensive
   - Close monitoring as weaning sedation and pain medication
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol
   - Consider restarting coumadin once pt has undergone [**Hospital1 793**] [**Hospital1 **] biopsy
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Restarted carvedilol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with hypoxia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Oliguria/anuria: The patient has had minimal urine output over the past 24 hours, with a creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, with a systolic pressure of up to 205 mmHg overnight.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently rate-controlled with pain and anxiety management.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has had a gastrointestinal bleed, which is currently stable, with a hematocrit level of 29.6%.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased to 46,000/μL, which is likely chronic in nature.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which is multifactorial, including pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and flash pulmonary edema.

The patient's medications include:

1. Carvedilol: The patient is currently taking 12.5 mg of carvedilol, which may be increased to 25 mg if her blood pressure remains elevated.
2. Diltiazem: The patient is taking diltiazem to control her hypertension.
3. Ipratropium: The patient is taking ipratropium to help manage her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
4. Home oxygen: The patient is using home oxygen therapy.
5. Vancomycin/Meropenem: The patient completed an 8-day course of vancomycin/meropenem for her gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient's laboratory results include:

1. Complete blood count: The patient's platelet count is 46,000/μL, with a white blood cell count of 7.2 x 10^9/L.
2. Electrolytes: The patient's sodium level is 134 mmol/L, potassium level is 4.1 mmol/L, and chloride level is 103 mmol/L.
3. Renal function: The patient's creatinine level is 0.8 mg/dL, with a blood urea nitrogen level of 20 mg/dL.
4. Liver function: The patient's alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level is 6 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level is 19 IU/L, and alkaline phosphatase (ALK) level is 43 IU/L.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Monitoring of urine output and creatinine levels to assess for oliguria/anuria.
2. Close monitoring of blood pressure to control hypertension.
3. Management of atrial fibrillation with rate control and anticoagulation.
4. Management of gastrointestinal bleeding with endoscopy and possible surgery.
5. Management of thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions and Vitamin B12 supplementation.
6. Management of respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
7. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels to prevent imbalances.
8. Close monitoring of liver function to assess for liver damage.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of oliguria/anuria, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
2. Hypertensive crisis, leading to stroke, myocardial infarction, or hypertensive encephalopathy.
3. Bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, epistaxis, or hematuria.
4. Respiratory failure, leading to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or respiratory arrest.
5. Thrombotic complications, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or cerebral thrombosis.
6. Infection, including pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or sepsis.
7. Liver damage, leading to liver failure or cirrhosis.
8. Skin breakdown, leading to pressure ulcers or skin infections.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex medical case with multiple comorbidities, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Her current medical conditions include oliguria/anuria, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and respiratory failure. The patient's plan of care includes close monitoring of her urine output, blood pressure, and electrolyte levels, as well as management of her atrial fibrillation, gastrointestinal bleeding, and respiratory failure."

   output with fluid as well as a high spec [**Last Name (un) **] I suspect that she is
   still slightly hypovolemic,
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine and monitor UOP
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was trialed on a trach mask however
   she was noted to a little somnelent and hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was
   then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10, PEEP 5). Will again attempt
   transition to trach mask.
   - Trial trach mask again today
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  No vomiting in >48 hours.  Hct is
   currently stable at 29.6 today.  GI c/s obtained who agreeded that
   bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated inless
   GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we
   want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they
   don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of
   4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets continued to decrease to a level of
   46 from 48 (have been as low as 61 previously during this
   hospitalization and most recently as high as 122 after a plt
   transfusion.  Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as far back
   at [**2151**]. Appreciate heme onc recs will start pt on Vitamin B12
   supplementation whilst awaiting MMA given low normal B12 levels.
   Discussed with pt
s son who is the healthcare proxy yesterday regarding
   the possibility of a [**Year (4 digits) 793**] [**Year (4 digits) **] biopsy which he agreed to. UPEP, SPEP,
   MMA, peripheral smear have been collected and are currently pending.
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - UPEP, SPEP, MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - Guaiac all stools
   - HIT antibody x 1 negative, other study is pending
   # Hypertension: Hypertensive as high as 205 overnight, responded well
   to IV hydralizine.  SBP
s this morning in 140
   - Continue carvedilol and diltiazem as her BP tolerates with higher
   holding parameters.
   - carvedilol currently at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], will consider increasing to 25mg
   [**Hospital1 **] if she continues to be hypertensive
   - Close monitoring as weaning sedation and pain medication
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol
   - Consider restarting coumadin once pt has undergone [**Hospital1 793**] [**Hospital1 **] biopsy
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Restarted carvedilol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and aortic valve replacement. She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical issues.

The patient's primary complaints are oliguria/anuria, hypercarbic respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and thrombocytopenia. She has a history of hypertension, benign, and is currently being managed with carvedilol.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 46 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* White blood cell count: 7.2 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 27 mEq/L
* Serum electrolytes: potassium 3.9 mEq/L, sodium 134 mEq/L, chloride 103 mEq/L

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: thin, no acute distress
* Cardiovascular: regular rate, 2+ distal pulses bilaterally
* Respiratory: symmetric chest expansion, resonant percussion, no crackles or wheezes
* Abdominal: soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
* Neurologic: attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person, place, and time

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications are:

* Oliguria/anuria: likely due to hypovolemia, chronic kidney disease, or medication side effects
* Hypercarbic respiratory failure: likely multifactorial, including pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and flash pulmonary edema
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: likely chronic, with a history of bleeding from the PEG site
* Thrombocytopenia: likely chronic, with a history of bleeding and transfusions
* Hypertension: likely due to chronic kidney disease, medication side effects, or other underlying conditions
* Atrial fibrillation: likely due to underlying cardiac conditions or medication side effects

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis: due to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or other underlying infections
* Acute kidney injury: due to hypovolemia, medication side effects, or other underlying conditions
* Respiratory failure: due to pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or other underlying conditions
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: due to chronic bleeding, medication side effects, or other underlying conditions
* Thrombocytopenia: due to bleeding, transfusions, or other underlying conditions
* Hypertension: due to chronic kidney disease, medication side effects, or other underlying conditions
* Atrial fibrillation: due to underlying cardiac conditions or medication side effects

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Fluid management: to manage hypovolemia and prevent further complications
* Blood transfusions: to manage anemia and thrombocytopenia
* Medication management: to manage hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and other underlying conditions
* Wound care: to manage the patient's back wound
* Nutrition: to manage the patient's nutritional needs
* Prophylaxis: to prevent DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-inch tall individual who weighs 46.4 kg, with a height of 60 inches. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, oliguria, GI bleed, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, and mental status changes.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.5°C (95.9°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 136/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a Tmax of 35.8°C (96.5°F) and a Tcurrent of 35.5°C (95.9°F).

The patient's lab results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.6 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 7.2-4.1 K/uL
* Platelet count: 90-46 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1-0.8 mg/dL
* Total CO2: 32-29 mmHg
* Glucose: 106-122 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 12.8/31.6/1.1, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 36/2/0.20, ALT/AST: 6-19, Alk Phos/T Bili: 43/0.3, Differential-Neuts: 90.5%, Band: 0.0%, Lymph: 4.7%, Mono: 4.5%, Eos: 0.2%, Fibrinogen: 105 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 0.8 mmol/L, Albumin: 3.5 g/dL, LDH: 284 IU/L, Ca++: 8.5 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 3.0 mg/dL

The patient's imaging results show:

* CXR: Right greater than left effusions
* Microbiology: Urine analysis is dirty, and a culture is pending

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure: Continue PSV and SBT trials to eventually transition to tracheostomy mask, and continue Advair, Ipratropium, home Xopenex, and steroids.
* Oliguria: Continue Ciprofloxacin for presumed UTI, change Foley catheter, and monitor fluid status.
* GI bleed: Maintain active type and screen, PICC access, and transfusion goal > 25.
* Thrombocytopenia: Continue monitoring platelet count, and consider further work-up with SPEP, UPEP, and MMA.
* AFib: Continue carvedilol and rate-controlled, and resume Coumadin post possible bone marrow biopsy.
* CAD: Continue statin and beta blocker, and hold ASA for GI bleed.
* HTN: Continue carvedilol and lisinopril.
* Mental status changes: Use Haldol prn rather than benzos for agitation.

The patient's ICU care includes:

* Nutrition: Fibersource HN (Full) at 30 mL/hour.
* Glycemic control: Regular insulin sliding scale.
* Lines: PICC line.
* Prophylaxis: DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: Pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory distress syndrome.
* Oliguria: Acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and electrolyte imbalance.
* GI bleed: Hemorrhagic shock, hypovolemic shock, and electrolyte imbalance.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following conditions and potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure:
	* The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to pneumonia (pna), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension, and post-tracheostomy (s/p perc trach).

   Assessment and Plan
 OLIGURIA/ANURIA
 .H/O HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER)
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 whilst admitted
   currently on minimal pressure support via trach and decreased urinary
   output
   # Oliguria: Over the past 24 hours has been 17cc/hr since MN. Cr stable
   at 0.8.  likely [**12-23**] hypovolemia though other vitals are stable.
   Received fluids overnight with increase in UOP.  UA grossly positive.
   Ucx from [**11-25**] with >100,000 yeast, likely colonization.
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine and monitor UOP
   - start empiric cipro for total of 7 days to end on [**2153-12-4**], await ucx
   sensitivities
   - goal UOP >30cc/hr
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was trialed on a trach mask however
   she was noted to a little somnelent and hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was
   then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10, PEEP 5). Will again attempt
   transition to trach mask.
   - Trial trach mask again today
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:   Hct stable for 4 days.   No vomiting in
   >48 hours.  Hct is currently stable at 29.6 today.  GI c/s obtained who
   agreeded that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not
   indicated inless GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at
   the PEG site if we want this (however this would not examine the entire
   abdomen and they don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her
   family is ok with her getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has
   recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets continued to decrease to a level of
   46 from 48 (have been as low as 61 previously during this
   hospitalization and most recently as high as 122 after a plt
   transfusion.  Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as far back
   at [**2151**]. Appreciate heme onc recs will start pt on Vitamin B12
   supplementation whilst awaiting MMA given low normal B12 levels.
   Discussed with pt
s son who is the healthcare proxy yesterday regarding
   the possibility of a bone marrow biopsy which he agreed to. UPEP, SPEP,
   MMA, peripheral smear have been collected and are currently pending.
   - heme onc following, appreciate recs
 plan for bone marrow bx,
   possibly today
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - UPEP, SPEP, MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - Guaiac all stools
   - HIT antibody x 1 negative, other study is pending
   # Hypertension: No iv medication required overnight for first time in a
   week.  Max bp 160
s.  Was started on lisinopril 5mg qd yesterday.
   Carvedilol increased to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] yesterday.
   - Continue carvedilol, diltiazem and lisinopril, titrate up ACE-I as
   needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting coumadin once pt has undergone bone marrow biopsy
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 whilst admitted
   currently on minimal pressure support via trach and decreased urinary
   output
   # Oliguria: Over the past 24 hours has been 17cc/hr since MN. Cr stable
   at 0.8.  likely [**12-23**] hypovolemia though other vitals are stable.
   Received fluids overnight with increase in UOP.  UA grossly positive.
   Ucx from [**11-25**] with >100,000 yeast, likely colonization.
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine and monitor UOP
   - start empiric cipro for total of 7 days to end on [**2153-12-4**], await ucx
   sensitivities
   - goal UOP >30cc/hr
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was trialed on a trach mask however
   she was noted to a little somnelent and hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was
   then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10, PEEP 5). Will again attempt
   transition to trach mask.
   - Trial trach mask again today
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:   Hct stable for 4 days.   No vomiting in
   >48 hours.  Hct is currently stable at 29.6 today.  GI c/s obtained who
   agreeded that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not
   indicated inless GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at
   the PEG site if we want this (however this would not examine the entire
   abdomen and they don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her
   family is ok with her getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has
   recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets continued to decrease to a level of
   46 from 48 (have been as low as 61 previously during this
   hospitalization and most recently as high as 122 after a plt
   transfusion.  Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as far back
   at [**2151**]. Appreciate heme onc recs will start pt on Vitamin B12
   supplementation whilst awaiting MMA given low normal B12 levels.
   Discussed with pt
s son who is the healthcare proxy yesterday regarding
   the possibility of a bone marrow biopsy which he agreed to. UPEP, SPEP,
   MMA, peripheral smear have been collected and are currently pending.
   - heme onc following, appreciate recs
 plan for bone marrow bx,
   possibly today
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - UPEP, SPEP, MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - Guaiac all stools
   - HIT antibody x 1 negative, other study is pending
   # Hypertension: No iv medication required overnight for first time in a
   week.  Max bp 160
s.  Was started on lisinopril 5mg qd yesterday.
   Carvedilol increased to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] yesterday.
   - Continue carvedilol, diltiazem and lisinopril, titrate up ACE-I as
   needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting coumadin once pt has undergone bone marrow biopsy
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and oliguria.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is currently on minimal pressure support via tracheostomy tube with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%. She has been extubated three times in the past, but has failed extubation attempts due to hypercarbic respiratory failure.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is rate-controlled with pain and anxiety management. She is not anticoagulated due to a recent gastrointestinal bleed.
* Renal status: The patient has oliguria, with a urine output of 17 cc/hr over the past 24 hours. Her creatinine level is stable at 0.8 mg/dL.
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, with a hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL. She has received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells.
* Hematological status: The patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 46 x 10^9/L. She is being treated with vitamin B12 supplementation and is awaiting the results of a bone marrow biopsy.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may require further interventions to improve her oxygenation and ventilation.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, and she may require anticoagulation therapy to prevent stroke or systemic embolization.
* Renal failure: The patient's oliguria may worsen, and she may require further interventions to improve her renal function.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may worsen, and she may require further interventions to control the bleeding.
* Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly in the respiratory and urinary tracts.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, and she may require further interventions to improve her platelet count.

The plan for the patient's care is to continue to monitor her respiratory status, cardiovascular status, renal status, gastrointestinal status, and hematological status. She will also undergo a bone marrow biopsy to determine the cause of her thrombocytopenia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   sensitivities
   - goal UOP >30cc/hr
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was trialed on a trach mask however
   she was noted to a little somnelent and hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was
   then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10, PEEP 5). Will again attempt
   transition to trach mask.
   - Trial trach mask after bone marrow bx
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets continued to decrease to a level of
   44 from 46 (have been as low as 61 previously during this
   hospitalization and most recently as high as 122 after a plt
   transfusion.  Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as far back
   at [**2151**]. Appreciate heme onc recs will start pt on Vitamin B12
   supplementation whilst awaiting MMA given low normal B12 levels.
   Discussed with pt
s son who is the healthcare proxy regarding the
   possibility of a bone marrow biopsy which he agreed to. UPEP, SPEP,
   MMA, peripheral smear have been collected and are currently pending.
   - heme onc following, appreciate recs
 plan for bone marrow bx,
   possibly today
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - UPEP, MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - SPEP negative
   - Guaiac all stools
   - HIT antibody x 1 negative, other study is pending
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:   Hct stable for 4 days.   No vomiting in
   >48 hours.  Hct is currently stable at 29.6 today.  GI c/s obtained who
   agreeded that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not
   indicated inless GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at
   the PEG site if we want this (however this would not examine the entire
   abdomen and they don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her
   family is ok with her getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has
   recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI change to qd
   # Hypertension: No iv medication required overnight for first time in a
   week.  Max bp 160
s.  Was started on lisinopril 5mg qd yesterday.
   Carvedilol increased to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] yesterday.
   - Continue carvedilol, diltiazem and lisinopril, titrate up ACE-I as
   needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting coumadin once pt has undergone bone marrow biopsy
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild

   Disposition: ICU pending placement in rehab<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and oliguria. She has been hospitalized for several weeks and has undergone multiple interventions, including tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and bone marrow biopsy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 158/65 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 23 inspirations per minute. She is receiving oxygen therapy through a tracheostomy tube and is being ventilated with a minimal pressure support.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.2, hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 44 K/uL. Her creatinine level is 0.8 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 25 mEq/L. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin, elderly woman with multiple confluent ecchymoses on her legs and back. She has a soft, non-tender abdomen and normal bowel sounds. Her extremities are trace positive for edema.

The patient's medical history is significant for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. She has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (bioprosthetic) in the past.

The patient's current medications include carvedilol, diltiazem, lisinopril, and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). She is also receiving antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Oliguria: The patient's urine output is low, and her creatinine level is elevated. She may require further evaluation and treatment for this condition.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and she may require platelet transfusions. She may also require further evaluation to determine the cause of her thrombocytopenia.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and she may require further evaluation and treatment for this condition.
4. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure, and she may require further evaluation and treatment for this condition.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and she may require further evaluation and treatment for this condition.
6. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, and she may require further evaluation and treatment for this condition.
7. Aortic valve replacement: The patient has undergone aortic valve replacement, and she may require further evaluation and treatment for this condition.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Oliguria: The patient will continue to receive hydration and diuretics as needed to maintain a urine output of at least 30 mL/hour.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient will continue to receive platelet transfusions as needed, and she may require further evaluation to determine the cause of her thrombocytopenia.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient will continue to receive antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy as needed to manage her gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient will continue to receive oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation as needed to manage her hypercarbic respiratory failure.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient will continue to receive anticoagulation therapy and rate control medication as needed to manage her atrial fibrillation.
6. Coronary artery disease: The patient will continue to receive medication as needed to manage her coronary artery disease.
7. Aortic valve replacement: The patient will continue to receive anticoagulation therapy and medication as needed to manage her aortic valve replacement.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and her disposition is ICU pending placement in rehabilitation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and is being treated for respiratory failure, oliguria, gastrointestinal bleed, thrombocytopenia, and nausea.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 117/87 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's respiratory support includes continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with a pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode, and the patient is receiving oxygen therapy with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.2 x 10^9/L, a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, and a platelet count of 90 x 10^9/L. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are within normal limits, and the patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 29.4 mL/min.

The patient's medical history is significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient is also taking medications for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if the patient's respiratory support is inadequate or if the patient develops pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
2. Oliguria: The patient's oliguria can worsen if the patient's kidney function continues to deteriorate or if the patient develops acute kidney injury (AKI).
3. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed can worsen if the patient's coagulopathy persists or if the patient develops further bleeding complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can worsen if the patient's platelet count continues to decline or if the patient develops further bleeding complications.
5. Nausea: The patient's nausea can worsen if the patient's underlying condition persists or if the patient develops further gastrointestinal complications.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, the patient's potential medical complications are:

1. Respiratory failure
2. Oliguria
3. Gastrointestinal bleed
4. Thrombocytopenia
5. Nausea"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-inch tall, 46.4 kg male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure due to pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension, and a tracheostomy. The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and is receiving antibiotics for a suspected urinary tract infection.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 34.7°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, and blood pressure of 117/87 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 97%. He has a tracheostomy tube in place, and his ventilator settings include CPAP/PSV mode with a peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress. His lungs are clear, and his abdomen is soft and non-tender. He has scattered ecchymoses on his skin.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.2 x 10^9/L, a platelet count of 90 x 10^9/L, and a serum creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 25 mg/dL, and his serum potassium level is 4.2 mEq/L. His liver enzymes are mildly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 43 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 43 IU/L.

The patient's medical plan includes continued mechanical ventilation, antibiotic therapy for his suspected urinary tract infection, and management of his gastrointestinal bleeding. He is also receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin and aspirin.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and the possibility of further deterioration should be closely monitored.
2. Urinary tract infection: The patient's urine culture results are pending, and the possibility of a urinary tract infection should be considered.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is a significant concern, and the possibility of further bleeding should be closely monitored.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and the possibility of further platelet consumption should be considered.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is a significant concern, and the possibility of further arrhythmias should be closely monitored.
6. Cardiac arrest: The patient's history of cardiac arrest is a significant concern, and the possibility of further cardiac arrest should be closely monitored.
7. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension is a significant concern, and the possibility of further pulmonary hypertension should be closely monitored.
8. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a significant concern, and the possibility of further exacerbations should be closely monitored."

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 whilst admitted
   currently on minimal pressure support via trach and decreased urinary
   output
    # Goals of Care: Patietn expressed that she did not want any further
   treatment/  Son [**Name (NI) 420**] last night, unable to come until this
   morning.  When arrives, will discuss goals of care.
   # Oliguria: Continues to be low at 10-20cc/hr persistenly. Neg 500cc
   yesterday. Cr stable at 0.8.  Likely [**12-23**] hypovolemia/hypoperfusion
   though other vitals are stable.   UA was grossly positive. Ucx from [**11-25**]
   with >100,000 yeast, likely colonization.
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine and monitor UOP
   - continue empiric cipro for total of 7 days to end on [**2153-12-4**], await
   ucx sensitivities
   - goal UOP >30cc/hr
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was trialed on a trach mask however
   she was noted to a little somnelent and hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was
   then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10, PEEP 5). Will again attempt
   transition to trach mask.
   - Trial trach mask after bone marrow bx
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Plt 52 this [**Last Name (un) 3241**] up from 44.  Got bone marrow
   biopsy yesterday.  Of note, plts have been as low as 61 previously
   during this hospitalization and most recently as high as 122 after a
   plt transfusion.  Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as far
   back at [**2151**].
   - heme onc following, appreciate recs
 has out patient f/u
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - UPEP, MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - SPEP negative
   - Guaiac all stools
   - HIT antibody x 1 negative, other study is pending
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:   Hct stable for 4 days.   No vomiting in
   >48 hours.  Hct is currently stable at 29.6 today.  GI c/s obtained who
   agreeded that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not
   indicated inless GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at
   the PEG site if we want this (however this would not examine the entire
   abdomen and they don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her
   family is ok with her getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has
   recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI change to qd
   # Hypertension: No iv medication required overnight for first time in a
   week.  Max bp 160
s.  Was started on lisinopril 5mg qd yesterday.
   Carvedilol increased to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] yesterday.
   - Continue carvedilol, diltiazem and lisinopril, titrate up ACE-I as
   needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting coumadin once pt has undergone bone marrow biopsy
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and oliguria.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 64 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 128/58 mmHg. She is on minimal pressure support via tracheostomy and has decreased urinary output.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.7 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 7.7 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count: 52 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 28 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.8 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.5 g/dL
* LDH: 284 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.2 mg/dL

The patient has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She has also received antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, and has been treated for atrial fibrillation with carvedilol.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Oliguria: The patient's urine output has been low, and her creatinine level is stable at 0.8 mg/dL. The patient's platelet count is 52 x 10^9/L, and she has undergone a bone marrow biopsy.
* Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has failed extubation attempts three times and has been reintubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been low, and she has received platelet transfusions.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has had a gastrointestinal bleed, and her hemoglobin level is 9.7 g/dL.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been controlled with medication, and she has been started on lisinopril.

The patient's goals of care are to be weaned off the ventilator and to have a discussion with her son about her treatment options. The patient has expressed a wish for no further treatment and would like to come off the ventilator.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate further, leading to respiratory failure.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed can worsen, leading to further bleeding and potential complications.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count can continue to be low, leading to bleeding complications.
* Oliguria: The patient's urine output can continue to be low, leading to potential kidney damage.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure can continue to be uncontrolled, leading to potential cardiovascular complications.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, oliguria, and hypertension. The patient's goals of care are to be weaned off the ventilator and to have a discussion with her son about her treatment options."

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 whilst admitted
   currently on minimal pressure support via trach and decreased urinary
   output
    # Goals of Care: Patient expressed that she did not want any further
   treatment/  Son [**Name (NI) 420**] last night, unable to come until this
   morning.  When arrives, will discuss goals of care.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was trialed on a trach mask however
   she was noted to a little somnelent and hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was
   then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10, PEEP 5). Will again attempt
   transition to trach mask. Of note, patien
ts baseline Bicarb appears to
   be in mid 30-s
 has been maintained here in 20
s which likely is
   inhibiting her ability to tolerate trach mask as not allowing
   permissive hypercapnia.  Will trial a decrease tidal volume and
   increase resp rate which will maintain minue ventilation but allow for
   lower alveolar ventilation and therefore keep patient
s CO2 slightly
   elevated.  This should ultimately allow her Bicarb to rise to her
   baseline of 36.
   - Trial trach mask  - if successful, patient may be more comfortable
   continuing with current plan of care, will discuss at family meeting
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Oliguria: Continues to be low at 10-20cc/hr persistently. Neg 500cc
   yesterday. Cr stable at 0.8.  Likely [**12-23**] hypovolemia/hypoperfusion
   though other vitals are stable.   UA was grossly positive. Ucx from [**11-25**]
   with >100,000 yeast, likely colonization.
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine and monitor UOP
   - continue empiric cipro for total of 7 days to end on [**2153-12-4**], await
   ucx sensitivities
   - goal UOP >30cc/hr
   # Thrombocytopenia: Plt 52 this [**Last Name (un) 3241**] up from 44.  Got bone marrow
   biopsy yesterday.  Of note, plts have been as low as 61 previously
   during this hospitalization and most recently as high as 122 after a
   plt transfusion.  Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as far
   back at [**2151**].
   - heme onc following, appreciate recs
 has out patient f/u
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - UPEP, MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - SPEP negative
   - Guaiac all stools
   - HIT antibody x 1 negative, other study is pending
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:   Hct stable for 4 days.   No vomiting in
   >48 hours.  Hct is currently stable at 29.6 today.  GI c/s obtained who
   agreeded that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not
   indicated inless GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at
   the PEG site if we want this (however this would not examine the entire
   abdomen and they don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her
   family is ok with her getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has
   recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI change to qd
   # Hypertension: No iv medication required overnight for first time in a
   week.  Max bp 160
s.  Was started on lisinopril 5mg qd yesterday.
   Carvedilol increased to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] yesterday.
   - Continue carvedilol, diltiazem and lisinopril, titrate up ACE-I as
   needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled and is otherwise
   hemodynamically stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed
   prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting coumadin
 when discuss goals of care with family
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 whilst admitted
   currently on minimal pressure support via trach and decreased urinary
   output
    # Goals of Care: Patient expressed that she did not want any further
   treatment/  Son [**Name (NI) 420**] last night, unable to come until this
   morning.  When arrives, will discuss goals of care.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was trialed on a trach mask however
   she was noted to a little somnelent and hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was
   then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10, PEEP 5). Will again attempt
   transition to trach mask. Of note, patien
ts baseline Bicarb appears to
   be in mid 30-s
 has been maintained here in 20
s which likely is
   inhibiting her ability to tolerate trach mask as not allowing
   permissive hypercapnia.  Will trial a decrease tidal volume and
   increase resp rate which will maintain minue ventilation but allow for
   lower alveolar ventilation and therefore keep patient
s CO2 slightly
   elevated.  This should ultimately allow her Bicarb to rise to her
   baseline of 36.
   - Trial trach mask  - if successful, patient may be more comfortable
   continuing with current plan of care, will discuss at family meeting
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Oliguria: Continues to be low at 10-20cc/hr persistently. Neg 500cc
   yesterday. Cr stable at 0.8.  Likely [**12-23**] hypovolemia/hypoperfusion
   though other vitals are stable.   UA was grossly positive. Ucx from [**11-25**]
   with >100,000 yeast, likely colonization.
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine and monitor UOP
   - continue empiric cipro for total of 7 days to end on [**2153-12-4**], await
   ucx sensitivities
   - goal UOP >30cc/hr
   # Thrombocytopenia: Plt 52 this [**Last Name (un) 3241**] up from 44.  Got bone marrow
   biopsy yesterday.  Of note, plts have been as low as 61 previously
   during this hospitalization and most recently as high as 122 after a
   plt transfusion.  Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as far
   back at [**2151**].
   - heme onc following, appreciate recs
 has out patient f/u
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - UPEP, MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - SPEP negative
   - Guaiac all stools
   - HIT antibody x 1 negative, other study is pending
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:   Hct stable for 4 days.   No vomiting in
   >48 hours.  Hct is currently stable at 29.6 today.  GI c/s obtained who
   agreeded that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not
   indicated inless GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at
   the PEG site if we want this (however this would not examine the entire
   abdomen and they don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her
   family is ok with her getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has
   recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI change to qd
   # Hypertension: No iv medication required overnight for first time in a
   week.  Max bp 160
s.  Was started on lisinopril 5mg qd yesterday.
   Carvedilol increased to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] yesterday.
   - Continue carvedilol, diltiazem and lisinopril, titrate up ACE-I as
   needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled and is otherwise
   hemodynamically stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed
   prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting coumadin
 when discuss goals of care with family
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and aortic valve replacement. She was admitted to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and oliguria. She has been treated with antibiotics, antihypertensives, and diuretics, but continues to require mechanical ventilation and has expressed a wish to come off the ventilator.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is on minimal pressure support via tracheostomy and has been having difficulty tolerating a tracheal mask due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. Her baseline bicarbonate level is in the mid-30s, which is being maintained at 20s.
* Renal status: The patient has oliguria, with a creatinine level of 0.8, and is at risk for acute kidney injury. She has been receiving empiric antibiotics and will continue to be monitored for signs of infection.
* Hematological status: The patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 52, and has undergone a bone marrow biopsy. Her platelet count has been fluctuating, and she is at risk for bleeding.
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which is being managed with blood transfusions and anticoagulation therapy.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with antihypertensive medications. She also has atrial fibrillation, which is being rate-controlled.

Potential medical complications:

* Acute kidney injury: The patient's oliguria and high creatinine level put her at risk for acute kidney injury.
* Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding put her at risk for bleeding complications.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen if she is unable to tolerate a tracheal mask or if her respiratory status deteriorates.
* Infection: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding and empiric antibiotics put her at risk for infection.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and atrial fibrillation put her at risk for cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.

Goals of care:

* The patient has expressed a wish to come off the ventilator and has a DNR (do not resuscitate) status. Her son will be discussing goals of care with her this morning.
* The patient's treatment plan includes continued management of her respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and oliguria, as well as ongoing monitoring of her hematological and cardiovascular status."

   Patient's initial bicarbonate on admission was 36 suggesting that she
   had significant hypercapnia at baseline. Her failure to come off the
   ventilator may relate to the fact that she was being over-ventilated
   leading to the kidney excreting bicarbonate (serum bicarb now 28); she
   may not be able to sustain the ventilation required with that level of
   serum bicabonate. On rounds, I placed her on trach mask. So far, she
   looks comfortable. If she tires, would use ""sprint/rest"" weaning
   strategy to strengthen muscles.
   WBC normal. Afebrile.
   Hemodynamically stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient's initial bicarbonate on admission was 36 suggesting that she
   had significant hypercapnia at baseline. Her failure to come off the
   ventilator may relate to the fact that she was being over-ventilated
   leading to the kidney excreting bicarbonate (serum bicarb now 28); she
   may not be able to sustain the ventilation required with that level of
   serum bicabonate. On rounds, I placed her on trach mask. So far, she
   looks comfortable. If she tires, would use ""sprint/rest"" weaning
   strategy to strengthen muscles.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-inch tall, 46.4 kg (admission weight 48.8 kg) adult with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and thrombocytopenia. The patient is currently intubated and on a ventilator with a PSV of 10/5, FiO2 of 35%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.5°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, and blood pressure of 127/48 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV, with a respiratory rate of 17 inspirations per minute and a SpO2 of 99%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7, hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, platelet count of 52 K/uL, and creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL. The patient's electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation.

The patient's assessment and plan include chronic thrombocytopenia, ineffective coping, oliguria/anuria, and respiratory failure, among other conditions. The patient's treatment plan includes restarting sc heparin, monitoring for bleeding, and adjusting ventilation and oxygenation as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and the patient's inability to come off the ventilator may indicate underlying lung disease or other respiratory issues.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is a risk factor for bleeding, and the patient's platelet count is currently stable but may drop further with ongoing bleeding or other complications.
3. Oliguria/anuria: The patient's oliguria/anuria may indicate kidney damage or failure, and the patient's creatinine level is elevated.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, or other cardiac complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be contributing to the patient's fatigue and other symptoms.
6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may increase the risk of infection or other complications.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may be a sign of underlying gastrointestinal disease or other complications.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or stroke.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their respiratory, cardiac, and gastrointestinal status to prevent complications and improve their overall outcome."

   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 whilst admitted
   currently on minimal pressure support via trach and decreased urinary
   output
    # Goals of Care: Patient expressed that she did not want any further
   treatment/  Son [**Name (NI) 420**] last night, unable to come until this
   morning.  When arrives, will discuss goals of care.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was trialed on a trach mask however
   she was noted to a little somnelent and hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was
   then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10, PEEP 5). Will again attempt
   transition to trach mask. Of note, patien
ts baseline Bicarb appears to
   be in mid 30-s
 has been maintained here in 20
s which likely is
   inhibiting her ability to tolerate trach mask as not allowing
   permissive hypercapnia.  Will trial a decrease tidal volume and
   increase resp rate which will maintain minue ventilation but allow for
   lower alveolar ventilation and therefore keep patient
s CO2 slightly
   elevated.  This should ultimately allow her Bicarb to rise to her
   baseline of 36.
   - Trial trach mask  - if successful, patient may be more comfortable
   continuing with current plan of care, will discuss at family meeting
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Oliguria: Continues to be low at 10-20cc/hr persistently. Neg 500cc
   yesterday. Cr stable at 0.8.  Likely [**12-23**] hypovolemia/hypoperfusion
   though other vitals are stable.   UA was grossly positive. Ucx from [**11-25**]
   with >100,000 yeast, likely colonization.
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine and monitor UOP
   - continue empiric cipro for total of 7 days to end on [**2153-12-4**], await
   ucx sensitivities
   - goal UOP >30cc/hr
   # Thrombocytopenia: Plt 52 this [**Last Name (un) 3241**] up from 44.  Got bone marrow
   biopsy yesterday.  Of note, plts have been as low as 61 previously
   during this hospitalization and most recently as high as 122 after a
   plt transfusion.  Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as far
   back at [**2151**].
   - heme onc following, appreciate recs
 has out patient f/u
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - UPEP, MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - SPEP negative
   - Guaiac all stools
   - HIT antibody x 1 negative, other study is pending
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:   Hct stable for 4 days.   No vomiting in
   >48 hours.  Hct is currently stable at 29.6 today.  GI c/s obtained who
   agreeded that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not
   indicated inless GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at
   the PEG site if we want this (however this would not examine the entire
   abdomen and they don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her
   family is ok with her getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has
   recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI change to qd
   # Hypertension: No iv medication required overnight for first time in a
   week.  Max bp 160
s.  Was started on lisinopril 5mg qd yesterday.
   Carvedilol increased to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] yesterday.
   - Continue carvedilol, diltiazem and lisinopril, titrate up ACE-I as
   needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled and is otherwise
   hemodynamically stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed
   prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting coumadin
 when discuss goals of care with family
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is receiving minimal pressure support via tracheostomy and is being monitored for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Her baseline bicarbonate level is in the mid-30s, which is being maintained at 20s, and her carbon dioxide levels are slightly elevated.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has coronary artery disease and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). She is currently receiving carvedilol and lisinopril for hypertension and is not anticoagulated.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is currently receiving empiric ciprofloxacin for 7 days. Her hemoglobin level is stable, and she has received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells.
* Hematological: The patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 52. She has undergone bone marrow biopsy and is being monitored for platelet recovery.
* Infectious: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and has been treated with ciprofloxacin. Her urine culture has grown yeast, which is likely colonization.

The patient's goals of care are to improve her respiratory status, manage her gastrointestinal bleeding, and address her thrombocytopenia. Her family has been informed of her condition and has expressed their wishes for her care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure could worsen, leading to respiratory acidosis and potential respiratory failure.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding could worsen, leading to hypovolemia, shock, and potential death.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia could worsen, leading to bleeding complications and potential death.
* Infection: The patient's UTI could worsen, leading to sepsis and potential death.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation could lead to cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiac arrest.

To address these potential complications, the patient's care team should continue to monitor her respiratory status, manage her gastrointestinal bleeding, and address her thrombocytopenia. The patient's family should be kept informed of her condition and her goals of care should be discussed and updated as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 s/p trach placement
   whilst admitted currently on minimal pressure support via trach
   awaiting a bed at rehab.
    # Goals of Care: Discussion with the patient and son yesterday
   occurred and both agreed that she would be sent to rehab.  She has a
   bed at [**Hospital1 630**] for tomorrow.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].
   Had completed 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was
   trialed on a trach mask however she was noted to a little somnelent and
   hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10,
   PEEP 5).  Trial of trach mask did not go well yesterday as her WOBing
   increased.
   - Will check an ABG today to see if her bicarb is elevated (as it
   should be since she has COPD and at baseline should be hypercarbic).
   If WNL should decrease her ventilatory rate and or tidal volume to
   allow for some permissive hypercarbia.  This may improve her chances of
   doing well with a trach mask trial.
   - Trach mask trial once more awake.
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   # Oliguria/Fluid overload: Continues to be low with a total output
   yesterday of 343 cc.  As she is 23 L positive for her LOS and she has a
   history of systolic heart failure with a previous EF of 50% she may be
   going into CHF.  Diuresising her may improve blood flow to her kidneys
   and improve her UOP and Cr (which has increased to 1.1 today, had been
   1.0)  UA was grossly positive. Ucx from [**11-28**] with pansensitve
   klebsiella.
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine and monitor UOP
   - continue cipro for total of 7 days to end on [**2153-12-4**]
   - goal UOP >30cc/hr
   - Diurese with 20 mg IV lasix x 1 with a goal of 500 cc to 1 L negative
   today.  Will check her I/Os this afternoon and given more lasix prn.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Plt 63 this [**Last Name (un) 3241**] up from 52.  Got bone marrow
   biopsy two days ago. Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as
   far back at [**2151**].  HIT Ab x 2 neg.  SPEP and UPEP negative.
   - heme onc following, appreciate recs
 has outpatient f/u
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:   Hct stable for 5 days.   No vomiting in
   >48 hours.  Hct is currently stable at 27.7 today.  GI c/s obtained who
   agreeded that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not
   indicated inless GIB worsened.  Has recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI qd
   # Hypertension: No iv medication required recently.  Max bp 140
   - Continue carvedilol, diltiazem and lisinopril, titrate up ACE-I as
   needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled and is otherwise
   hemodynamically stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed
   prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol as above
   - Patient had stopped anticoagulation as an outpatient months before
   admission.  Will not restart as this was agreeded upon with her PCP as
   an outpatient likely due to her fall/bleeding risk.
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 s/p trach placement
   whilst admitted currently on minimal pressure support via trach
   awaiting a bed at rehab.
    # Goals of Care: Discussion with the patient and son yesterday
   occurred and both agreed that she would be sent to rehab.  She has a
   bed at [**Hospital1 630**] for tomorrow.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].
   Had completed 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was
   trialed on a trach mask however she was noted to a little somnelent and
   hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10,
   PEEP 5).  Trial of trach mask did not go well yesterday as her WOBing
   increased.
   - Will check an ABG today to see if her bicarb is elevated (as it
   should be since she has COPD and at baseline should be hypercarbic).
   If WNL should decrease her ventilatory rate and or tidal volume to
   allow for some permissive hypercarbia.  This may improve her chances of
   doing well with a trach mask trial.
   - Trach mask trial once more awake.
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   # Oliguria/Fluid overload: Continues to be low with a total output
   yesterday of 343 cc.  As she is 23 L positive for her LOS and she has a
   history of systolic heart failure with a previous EF of 50% she may be
   going into CHF.  Diuresising her may improve blood flow to her kidneys
   and improve her UOP and Cr (which has increased to 1.1 today, had been
   1.0)  UA was grossly positive. Ucx from [**11-28**] with pansensitve
   klebsiella.
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine and monitor UOP
   - continue cipro for total of 7 days to end on [**2153-12-4**]
   - goal UOP >30cc/hr
   - Diurese with 20 mg IV lasix x 1 with a goal of 500 cc to 1 L negative
   today.  Will check her I/Os this afternoon and given more lasix prn.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Plt 63 this [**Last Name (un) 3241**] up from 52.  Got bone marrow
   biopsy two days ago. Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as
   far back at [**2151**].  HIT Ab x 2 neg.  SPEP and UPEP negative.
   - heme onc following, appreciate recs
 has outpatient f/u
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:   Hct stable for 5 days.   No vomiting in
   >48 hours.  Hct is currently stable at 27.7 today.  GI c/s obtained who
   agreeded that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not
   indicated inless GIB worsened.  Has recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI qd
   # Hypertension: No iv medication required recently.  Max bp 140
   - Continue carvedilol, diltiazem and lisinopril, titrate up ACE-I as
   needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled and is otherwise
   hemodynamically stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed
   prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol as above
   - Patient had stopped anticoagulation as an outpatient months before
   admission.  Will not restart as this was agreeded upon with her PCP as
   an outpatient likely due to her fall/bleeding risk.
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN.

   Patient very lethargic today; has not slept in 3 days. Probably cannot
   do trach mask trials today. Will begin diuresis; has evidence of total
   body volume overload and large pleural effusions, which are likely
   contributing to ongoing respiratory failure. Check ABG and VBG
   simultaneously. I am still concerned that we may be overventilating her
   relative to what would be ideal for her. With a higher PaCO2, the
   minute ventilation she will need to generate will be less. Need acid
   stimulus to get kidney to generate bicarbonate.  Creat up slightly;
   watch with diuresis. Potassium up to 5; may relate to low urine output.
   Recheck later today.
   Hct stable. No evidence of ongoing bleeding.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient very lethargic today; has not slept in 3 days. Probably cannot
   do trach mask trials today. Will begin diuresis; has evidence of total
   body volume overload and large pleural effusions, which are likely
   contributing to ongoing respiratory failure. Check ABG and VBG
   simultaneously. I am still concerned that we may be overventilating her
   relative to what would be ideal for her. With a higher PaCO2, the
   minute ventilation she will need to generate will be less. Need acid
   stimulus to get kidney to generate bicarbonate.  Creat up slightly;
   watch with diuresis. Potassium up to 5; may relate to low urine output.
   Recheck later today.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-inch tall, 46.4 kg (admission 48.8 kg) individual with a history of respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube. The patient has been receiving prophylactic antibiotics, heparin, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.5°C, heart rate of 65 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 129/46 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 100% on 35% oxygen. The patient's neurological status is also stable, with the patient being attentive and following simple commands.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying COPD and pneumonia.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding.
3. Oliguria/anuria: The patient's urine output is low, which may indicate kidney dysfunction.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
7. Skin integrity issues: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may increase the risk of skin breakdown and infection.
8. Impaired kidney function: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, which may indicate impaired kidney function.
9. Acid-base imbalance: The patient's blood gases indicate an acid-base imbalance, which may increase the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular complications.
10. Overventilation: The patient may be overventilated, which may increase the risk of respiratory complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilation settings as necessary.
2. Monitor the patient's platelet count and bleeding risk closely and consider platelet transfusions if necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's urine output and kidney function closely and consider diuretics and other treatments if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and cardiovascular status closely and consider antihypertensive medications if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and consider cardioversion if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding risk and consider prophylactic treatments if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's skin integrity and consider wound care and other treatments if necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's acid-base balance and consider treatments if necessary.
9. Consider weaning the patient off mechanical ventilation if possible.
10. Consider transferring the patient to a step-down unit or another facility if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 s/p trach placement
   whilst admitted currently on minimal pressure support via trach
   awaiting a bed at rehab.
    # Goals of Care: Discussion with the patient and son yesterday
   occurred and both agreed that she would be sent to rehab.  She has a
   bed at [**Hospital1 630**] for tomorrow.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].
   Had completed 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was
   trialed on a trach mask however she was noted to a little somnelent and
   hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10,
   PEEP 5).  Trial of trach mask did not go well yesterday as her WOBing
   increased.
   - Will check an ABG today to see if her bicarb is elevated (as it
   should be since she has COPD and at baseline should be hypercarbic).
   If WNL should decrease her ventilatory rate and or tidal volume to
   allow for some permissive hypercarbia.  This may improve her chances of
   doing well with a trach mask trial.
   - Trach mask trial once more awake.
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   # Oliguria/Fluid overload: Continues to be low with a total output
   yesterday of 343 cc.  As she is 23 L positive for her LOS and she has a
   history of systolic heart failure with a previous EF of 50% she may be

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 s/p trach placement
   whilst admitted currently on minimal pressure support via trach
   awaiting a bed at rehab.
    # Goals of Care: Discussion with the patient and son yesterday
   occurred and both agreed that she would be sent to rehab.  She has a
   bed at [**Hospital1 630**] for tomorrow.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].
   Had completed 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was
   trialed on a trach mask however she was noted to a little somnelent and
   hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10,
   PEEP 5).  Trial of trach mask did not go well yesterday as her WOBing
   increased.
   - Will check an ABG today to see if her bicarb is elevated (as it
   should be since she has COPD and at baseline should be hypercarbic).
   If WNL should decrease her ventilatory rate and or tidal volume to
   allow for some permissive hypercarbia.  This may improve her chances of
   doing well with a trach mask trial.
   - Trach mask trial once more awake.
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   # Oliguria/Fluid overload: Continues to be low with a total output
   yesterday of 343 cc.  As she is 23 L positive for her LOS and she has a
   history of systolic heart failure with a previous EF of 50% she may be
   going into CHF.  Diuresising her may improve blood flow to her kidneys
   and improve her UOP and Cr (which has increased to 1.1 today, had been
   1.0)  UA was grossly positive. Ucx from [**11-28**] with pansensitve
   klebsiella.
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine and monitor UOP
   - continue cipro for total of 7 days to end on [**2153-12-4**]
   - goal UOP >30cc/hr
   - Diurese with 20 mg IV lasix x 1 with a goal of 500 cc to 1 L negative
   today.  Will check her I/Os this afternoon and given more lasix prn.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Plt 63 this [**Last Name (un) 3241**] up from 52.  Got bone marrow
   biopsy two days ago. Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as
   far back at [**2151**].  HIT Ab x 2 neg.  SPEP and UPEP negative.
   - heme onc following, appreciate recs
 has outpatient f/u
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:   Hct stable for 5 days.   No vomiting in
   >48 hours.  Hct is currently stable at 27.7 today.  GI c/s obtained who
   agreeded that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not
   indicated inless GIB worsened.  Has recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI qd
   # Hypertension: No iv medication required recently.  Max bp 140
   - Continue carvedilol, diltiazem and lisinopril, titrate up ACE-I as
   needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled and is otherwise
   hemodynamically stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed
   prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol as above
   - Patient had stopped anticoagulation as an outpatient months before
   admission.  Will not restart as this was agreeded upon with her PCP as
   an outpatient likely due to her fall/bleeding risk.
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and oliguria.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: She is on minimal pressure support via tracheostomy (PSV) with a tidal volume of 312 mL and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 93% on a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%.
* Cardiovascular: She has atrial fibrillation, and her blood pressure is 151/45 mmHg.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 7.7 L/min, and her pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) is not reported.
* Fluid balance: She has a positive fluid balance of 1,749 mL, with an intake of 1,209 mL and an output of 1,755 mL.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete blood count (CBC): White blood cell count (WBC) 3.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL, and platelet count (Plt) 57 K/uL.
	+ Electrolyte levels: Sodium (Na) 151 mg/dL, potassium (K) 4.9 mEq/L, and chloride (Cl) 100 mEq/L.
	+ Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 27.3 mg/dL and creatinine (Cr) 1.1 mg/dL.
	+ Liver function tests (LFTs): Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 6-19 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 6-19 IU/L, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 43 IU/L.
	+ Troponin-T 0.20 ng/mL.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbia may worsen her respiratory failure, leading to further increase in respiratory rate and tidal volume.
* Oliguria: The patient's low urine output may indicate acute kidney injury, which may worsen her fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding may recur, especially if she continues to receive anticoagulation therapy.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure may continue to be elevated, which may worsen her cardiovascular condition.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to further increase in her heart rate and blood pressure.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Minimal pressure support via tracheostomy
* Oxygen therapy
* Fluid management to prevent fluid overload
* Diuresis with lasix to improve urine output
* Platelet transfusion for thrombocytopenia
* Continue anticoagulation therapy
* Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding
* Monitor for signs of worsening atrial fibrillation

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions, including hypercarbic respiratory failure, oliguria, thrombocytopenia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. She requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve her clinical condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-inch tall, 46.4 kg male admitted to the ICU with chronic respiratory failure, chronic kidney failure, oliguria/anuria, and atrial flutter. He has been receiving mechanical ventilation and has had persistent bradycardia. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, and blood pressure of 125/47 mmHg. He is receiving prophylactic antibiotics, anticoagulation therapy, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His liver enzymes are elevated, with ALT and AST levels above the normal range. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and atrial flutter. He has also had a recent episode of gastrointestinal bleeding, which has been resolved.

The patient's current medications include antibiotics, anticoagulation therapy, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may lead to further respiratory decline, requiring increased ventilatory support or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and prolonged hospitalization make him prone to infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or sepsis.
3. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and anticoagulation therapy may increase his risk of bleeding, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.
4. Kidney injury: The patient's chronic kidney disease and oliguria/anuria may lead to further kidney damage, requiring dialysis or other renal replacement therapy.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial flutter and hypertension may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or stroke.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition and inadequate caloric intake may lead to further complications, such as weakness, fatigue, or impaired wound healing.
7. Skin integrity issues: The patient's impaired skin integrity may lead to further complications, such as wound infections, pressure ulcers, or skin breakdown."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-inch tall, 46.4 kg individual who is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of chronic respiratory failure, chronic kidney failure, oliguria/anuria, hypertension, atrial flutter, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for approximately 24 hours and has been receiving various treatments, including mechanical ventilation, antibiotics, and medication for blood pressure control.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 65 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 125/47 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and has a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 3.9 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 57 x 10^9/L. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 151 mg/dL, and creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and atrial flutter. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and has been taking anticoagulant therapy.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may worsen due to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or other respiratory complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient's chronic kidney failure and oliguria/anuria may increase the risk of sepsis, particularly if the patient develops a urinary tract infection.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and anticoagulant therapy may increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly if the patient undergoes invasive procedures or experiences trauma.
4. Skin integrity issues: The patient's impaired skin integrity may increase the risk of skin breakdown and infection, particularly if the patient is immobile or has poor wound care.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if the patient develops fluid overload or other conditions that increase blood pressure.
6. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter may worsen if the patient develops heart failure or other cardiac complications.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding may increase the risk of recurrent bleeding, particularly if the patient develops bleeding complications or experiences trauma.
8. Infection: The patient's chronic kidney failure and oliguria/anuria may increase the risk of infection, particularly if the patient develops a urinary tract infection or other infections.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but the patient is at risk for various medical complications. Close monitoring and management of the patient's condition are necessary to prevent or minimize these complications."
