   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 87 yo male s/p CVA, nonverbal, with HTN, type 2 DM who
   presents with high fevers, likely secondary to cellulitis.
   Additionally has hypernatremia and acute renal failure likely secondary
   to dehydration.
   1.  Cellulitis.  Patient with significant warmth and and erythema over
   right lower extremity.
   - doppler to r/o concurrent DVT
   - blood cultures
   - vanco
   2.  Fever/Leukocytosis.  Likely source of infection is cellulitis,
   however, pneumonia remains a possibility given chest CT findings.
   Patient at high risk for aspiration given AMS.  Also concern for
   purulent drainage from PEG.
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures, sputum culture
   - f/u cultures from PEG site
   - vanco/cefepime/levo (PCN allergy) for broad spectrum coverage
   3.  Hypotension.  Hypotension likely secondary to poor PO intake over
   several weeks in addition to sepsis from infection (likely cellulitis).
   - IVF bolus
   - Levophed to keep MAPS > 65 if needed
   - hold antihypertensives (lisinopril, amlodipine, flomax)
   - hold baclofen
   4.  Hypernatremia.  Significant hypernatremia likely refects ongoing
   infection and poor PO intake over the course of several days to week.
   Given that patient remains markedly hypovolemic, will continue with NS.
   When volume replete, will change to 1/2NS (as hyperglycemia was a
   concern).
   - NS bolus to keeps MAPS> 60
   - free water flushes through PEG
   - q8 hour sodium
   5.  Renal failure.  Creatinine rose after getting 5L NS in ED and in
   MICU.  Likely from profound dehydration and possible sepsis in setting
   of cellulitis.
   - follow Cr
   - IVF boluses to keep MAPs > 65
   - check urine lytes
   6. Hyperglycemia.  Patient is a type 2 diabetic.  No evidence of DKA.
   Likely elevated in setting of infection
   - Lantus + HISS
   - follow fingersticks
   - while uptitrating tube feeds, will give lantus at reduced dose (10
   instead of 14); will give 14 tomorrow night
   7.  AMS.  Likely secondary to s/p CVA in [**2109**], s/p traumatic SDH x 2,
   significant hypernatremia, and infection.  Head CT showed no acute
   process.
   - IVF boluses to correct hypernatremia
   - continue aricept
   - vanco/cefepime/levo for infection
   8.  Thrombocytopenia.  Unknown baseline.  Platelet count most recent
   was 137 on [**3-15**].
   - peripheral smear
   - DIC labs
   - minimize offending meds
   - obtain baseline from [**Hospital 590**] rehab
   9.  Anemia.  Unclear baseline.
   - trend Hct
   - iron studies
   - guiaic stools
   10.  Troponin leak:
   When afebrile and s/p 5L NS, HR has fallen to 40s.  No prior EKG for
   comparison but no evidence of ACS.  Likely demand ischemia in setting
   of infection and tachcardia. Troponin at presentation was 0.07 and was
   0.05 this AM.
   - Check troponin this afternoon to complete 24 hour rule-out.
   11.  Sacral decub.
   - Wound care via nursing
   - MD to observe this PM

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male who presents with high fevers, likely secondary to cellulitis, and has hypernatremia and acute renal failure likely due to dehydration. The patient has a complex medical history, including a recent CVA, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and a history of traumatic SDH.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's high fevers, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures suggest sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction, shock, and even death.
2. Cellulitis progression: The patient's cellulitis may progress, leading to further tissue damage, increased risk of amputation, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and increased risk of cardiovascular complications.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen, leading to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, or even death.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to increased risk of bleeding, especially in the setting of cellulitis and sepsis.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to further complications such as fatigue, decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, and increased risk of cardiovascular complications.
7. Troponin leak: The patient's troponin leak may indicate myocardial injury, which can lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or even death.
8. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer may worsen, leading to further tissue damage, increased risk of infection, and potentially life-threatening complications.
9. Aspiration risk: The patient's altered mental status and risk of aspiration may lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia, which can further worsen his condition.
10. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and potential cardiac complications may lead to further cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, or arrhythmias.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 87 yo M s/p CVA, nonverbal, with HTN, type 2 DM who presents
   with fever to 106, likely secondary to extensive LE cellulitis.
   Additionally has hypernatremia and acute renal failure likely secondary
   to dehydration.
   #   Fever / Leukocytosis:
   Likely attributed to cellulitis. Patient with significant warmth and
   and erythema over right lower extremity at presentation. Now with
   decrease in WBC from 14 to 10.9 and has been afebrile following
   admission. Despite cellulitis being most likely cause of fever and
   leukocytosis, pneumonia (given chest CT) and peri-PEG infection (given
   purulent drainage around PEG). Still should rule out DVT as cause of
   fever and erythema of RLE.
   - Continue Vanc, cefepime, levofloxacin
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Follow-up wound cultures from PEG site
   - Follow-up doppler RLE
   #  Hypotension:
   Hypotension likely secondary to poor PO intake over several weeks in
   addition to sepsis from infection (likely cellulitis).
   - IVF bolus as needed
   - Hold antihypertensives (lisinopril, amlodipine, flomax) and baclofen
   #  Hypernatremia:
   Significant hypernatremia likely reflects ongoing infection and poor PO
   intake over the course of several days to week. Initially received NS
   for rehydration. Now that pressures are maintained without need for
   frequent boluses, will hold on further IVF and manage hypernatremia
   with free water via PEG.
   - Free water flushes through PEG
   - Q8H sodium check
   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Creatinine rose after getting 5L NS in ED and in MICU. Has fallen
   slightly to 1.1 upon 0900 labs this AM.  Likely from profound
   dehydration and possible sepsis in setting of cellulitis.
   - Follow-up Cr with PM lytes and ongoing hydration via PEG
   # Hyperglycemia:
   Patient is a type 2 diabetic.  No evidence of DKA.  Likely elevated in
   setting of infection.
   - Lantus + HISS and uptitrate doses as needed. Will set lantus at 14 U
   tonight to cover increased tube feeds.
   - QID fingersticks
   #  AMS:
   Unknown recent baseline. Likely secondary to s/p CVA in [**2109**], s/p
   traumatic SDH x 2, significant hypernatremia, and infection.  Head CT
   showed no acute process.
   - IVF boluses to correct hypernatremia
   - Continue donepezil
   - vanco/cefepime/levo for infection
   #  Thrombocytopenia:
   Unknown baseline.  Platelet count most recent was 137 on [**3-15**]. Is 93
   this AM.
   - Follow-up peripheral smear
   - Recheck PLT on PM labs
   - Minimize offending meds
   - Obtain baseline PLT count from [**Hospital 590**] rehab
   # Anemia:
   Unclear baseline.
   - trend Hct
   - iron studies
   - guiaic stools
   10.  Troponin leak:
   When afebrile and s/p 5L NS, HR has fallen to 40s.  No prior EKG for
   comparison but no evidence of ACS.  Likely demand ischemia in setting
   of infection and tachcardia. Troponin at presentation was 0.07 and was
   0.05 this AM.
   - Check troponin this afternoon to complete 24 hour rule-out.
   11.  Sacral decub.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   purulent drainage around PEG). Still should rule out DVT as cause of
   fever and erythema of RLE.
   - Continue Vanc, cefepime, levofloxacin
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Follow-up wound cultures from PEG site
   - Follow-up doppler RLE
   #  Hypotension:
   Hypotension likely secondary to poor PO intake over several weeks in
   addition to sepsis from infection (likely cellulitis).
   - IVF bolus as needed
   - Hold antihypertensives (lisinopril, amlodipine, flomax) and baclofen
   #  Hypernatremia:
   Significant hypernatremia likely reflects ongoing infection and poor PO
   intake over the course of several days to week. Initially received NS
   for rehydration. Now that pressures are maintained without need for
   frequent boluses, will hold on further IVF and manage hypernatremia
   with free water via PEG.
   - Free water flushes through PEG
   - Q8H sodium check
   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Creatinine rose after getting 5L NS in ED and in MICU. Has fallen
   slightly to 1.1 upon 0900 labs this AM.  Likely from profound
   dehydration and possible sepsis in setting of cellulitis.
   - Follow-up Cr with PM lytes and ongoing hydration via PEG
   # Hyperglycemia:
   Patient is a type 2 diabetic.  No evidence of DKA.  Likely elevated in
   setting of infection.
   - Lantus + HISS and uptitrate doses as needed. Will set lantus at 14 U
   tonight to cover increased tube feeds.
   - QID fingersticks
   #  AMS:
   Unknown recent baseline. Likely secondary to s/p CVA in [**2109**], s/p
   traumatic SDH x 2, significant hypernatremia, and infection.  Head CT
   showed no acute process.
   - IVF boluses to correct hypernatremia
   - Continue donepezil
   - vanco/cefepime/levo for infection
   #  Thrombocytopenia:
   Unknown baseline.  Platelet count most recent was 137 on [**3-15**]. Is 93
   this AM.
   - Follow-up peripheral smear
   - Recheck PLT on PM labs
   - Minimize offending meds
   - Obtain baseline PLT count from [**Hospital 590**] rehab
   # Anemia:
   Unclear baseline.
   - trend Hct
   - iron studies
   - guiaic stools
   10.  Troponin leak:
   When afebrile and s/p 5L NS, HR has fallen to 40s.  No prior EKG for
   comparison but no evidence of ACS.  Likely demand ischemia in setting
   of infection and tachcardia. Troponin at presentation was 0.07 and was
   0.05 this AM.
   - Check troponin this afternoon to complete 24 hour rule-out.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of CVA, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes who presents with fever, likely secondary to extensive right lower extremity (RLE) cellulitis. He has hypernatremia and acute renal failure, likely due to dehydration. The patient is non-verbal and has a PEG tube with purulent drainage around the site. He has a sacral decubitus ulcer and is at risk for DVT.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and hypernatremia suggest ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia risk increase the likelihood of respiratory failure.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's hypernatremia and acute renal failure may worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease.
4. Wound Complications: The sacral decubitus ulcer and purulent drainage around the PEG site increase the risk of wound complications, such as infection and dehiscence.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
7. Troponin Leak: The patient's troponin leak may indicate demand ischemia, which can lead to cardiac complications.
8. DVT: The patient's risk factors, including immobility and dehydration, increase the likelihood of DVT.
9. Pneumonia: The patient's risk factors, including age and immobility, increase the likelihood of pneumonia.
10. Infection: The patient's PEG site and sacral decubitus ulcer increase the risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and antifungals to treat the cellulitis and pneumonia.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs, including temperature, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust fluid management accordingly.
4. Monitor the patient's wound healing and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's troponin levels and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Consider prophylactic anticoagulation to prevent DVT.
8. Consider prophylactic antibiotics to prevent pneumonia.
9. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment as necessary.
10. Consider consultation with a wound care specialist and a nephrologist to optimize the patient's care."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 87 yo M s/p CVA, nonverbal, with HTN, type 2 DM who presents
   with fever to 106, likely secondary to extensive LE cellulitis.
   Additionally has hypernatremia and acute renal failure likely secondary
   to dehydration.
   #   Fever / Leukocytosis:
   Likely attributed to cellulitis. Patient with significant warmth and
   and erythema over right lower extremity at presentation. Now with
   decrease in WBC from 14 to 10.9 and has been afebrile following
   admission. Despite cellulitis being most likely cause of fever and
   leukocytosis, pneumonia (given chest CT) and peri-PEG infection (given
   purulent drainage around PEG). Still should rule out DVT as cause of
   fever and erythema of RLE.
   - Continue Vanc, cefepime, levofloxacin
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Follow-up wound cultures from PEG site
   - Follow-up doppler RLE
   #  Hypotension / Bradycardia:
   Hypotension likely secondary to poor PO intake over several weeks in
   addition to sepsis from infection (likely cellulitis). Does not appear
   to be linked to bradycardia (baseline HR in low 50s) at this time;
   however, will continue to monitor.
   - IVF bolus as needed
   - Hold antihypertensives (lisinopril, amlodipine, flomax) and baclofen
   #  Hypernatremia:
   Significant hypernatremia likely reflects ongoing infection and poor PO
   intake over the course of several days to week. Initially received NS
   for rehydration. Now that pressures are maintained without need for
   frequent boluses, will hold on further IVF and manage hypernatremia
   with free water via PEG.
   - Free water flushes through PEG
   - Q8H sodium check
   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Creatinine rose after getting 5L NS in ED and in MICU. Has fallen
   slightly to 1.1 upon 0900 labs this AM.  Likely from profound
   dehydration and possible sepsis in setting of cellulitis.
   - Follow-up Cr with PM lytes and ongoing hydration via PEG
   # Hyperglycemia:
   Patient is a type 2 diabetic.  No evidence of DKA.  Likely elevated in
   setting of infection.
   - Lantus + HISS and uptitrate doses as needed. Will set lantus at 14 U
   tonight to cover increased tube feeds.
   - QID fingersticks
   #  AMS:
   Unknown recent baseline. Likely secondary to s/p CVA in [**2109**], s/p
   traumatic SDH x 2, significant hypernatremia, and infection.  Head CT
   showed no acute process.
   - IVF boluses to correct hypernatremia
   - Continue donepezil
   - vanco/cefepime/levo for infection
   # Hypocalcemia:
   Corrected Ca of 7.3 this AM.
   - Replete and recheck Ca on PM lytes
   #  Thrombocytopenia:
   Unknown baseline.  Platelet count most recent was 137 on [**3-15**]. Is 93
   this AM. DIC labs negative yesterday for signs of DIC.
   - Follow-up peripheral smear
   - Recheck PLT on PM labs
   - Minimize offending meds
   - Obtain baseline PLT count from [**Hospital 590**] rehab
   # Anemia:
   Unclear baseline. Down slightly to 31.4 from 35.5 at admission. Not
   iron deficient by labs (ferritin 1478 and FeSat = 44%).
   - Trend HCT
   - Guiaic stools
   # Troponin leak:
   When afebrile and s/p 5L NS, HR has fallen to 40s.  No prior EKG for
   comparison but no evidence of ACS.  Likely demand ischemia in setting
   of infection and tachcardia. Troponin at presentation was 0.07 and was
   0.05 this AM.
   - Check troponin this afternoon to complete 24 hour rule-out.
   #  Sacral decubitis ulcer:
   - Wound care via nursing

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 87 yo M s/p CVA, nonverbal, with HTN, type 2 DM who presents
   with fever to 106, likely secondary to extensive LE cellulitis.
   Additionally has hypernatremia and acute renal failure likely secondary
   to dehydration.
   #   Fever / Leukocytosis:
   Likely attributed to cellulitis. Patient with significant warmth and
   and erythema over right lower extremity at presentation. Now with
   decrease in WBC from 14 to 10.9 and has been afebrile following
   admission. Despite cellulitis being most likely cause of fever and
   leukocytosis, pneumonia (given chest CT) and peri-PEG infection (given
   purulent drainage around PEG). Still should rule out DVT as cause of
   fever and erythema of RLE.
   - Continue Vanc, cefepime, levofloxacin
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Follow-up wound cultures from PEG site
   - Follow-up doppler RLE
   #  Hypotension / Bradycardia:
   Hypotension likely secondary to poor PO intake over several weeks in
   addition to sepsis from infection (likely cellulitis). Does not appear
   to be linked to bradycardia (baseline HR in low 50s) at this time;
   however, will continue to monitor.
   - IVF bolus as needed
   - Hold antihypertensives (lisinopril, amlodipine, flomax) and baclofen
   #  Hypernatremia:
   Significant hypernatremia likely reflects ongoing infection and poor PO
   intake over the course of several days to week. Initially received NS
   for rehydration. Now that pressures are maintained without need for
   frequent boluses, will hold on further IVF and manage hypernatremia
   with free water via PEG.
   - Free water flushes through PEG
   - Q8H sodium check
   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Creatinine rose after getting 5L NS in ED and in MICU. Has fallen
   slightly to 1.1 upon 0900 labs this AM.  Likely from profound
   dehydration and possible sepsis in setting of cellulitis.
   - Follow-up Cr with PM lytes and ongoing hydration via PEG
   # Hyperglycemia:
   Patient is a type 2 diabetic.  No evidence of DKA.  Likely elevated in
   setting of infection.
   - Lantus + HISS and uptitrate doses as needed. Will set lantus at 14 U
   tonight to cover increased tube feeds.
   - QID fingersticks
   #  AMS:
   Unknown recent baseline. Likely secondary to s/p CVA in [**2109**], s/p
   traumatic SDH x 2, significant hypernatremia, and infection.  Head CT
   showed no acute process.
   - IVF boluses to correct hypernatremia
   - Continue donepezil
   - vanco/cefepime/levo for infection
   # Hypocalcemia:
   Corrected Ca of 7.3 this AM.
   - Replete and recheck Ca on PM lytes
   #  Thrombocytopenia:
   Unknown baseline.  Platelet count most recent was 137 on [**3-15**]. Is 93
   this AM. DIC labs negative yesterday for signs of DIC.
   - Follow-up peripheral smear
   - Recheck PLT on PM labs
   - Minimize offending meds
   - Obtain baseline PLT count from [**Hospital 590**] rehab
   # Anemia:
   Unclear baseline. Down slightly to 31.4 from 35.5 at admission. Not
   iron deficient by labs (ferritin 1478 and FeSat = 44%).
   - Trend HCT
   - Guiaic stools
   # Troponin leak:
   When afebrile and s/p 5L NS, HR has fallen to 40s.  No prior EKG for
   comparison but no evidence of ACS.  Likely demand ischemia in setting
   of infection and tachcardia. Troponin at presentation was 0.07 and was
   0.05 this AM.
   - Check troponin this afternoon to complete 24 hour rule-out.
   #  Sacral decubitis ulcer:
   - Wound care via nursing
   - MD to observe this PM

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a complex medical condition. The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (99°F)
* Heart rate: 48-98 bpm
* Blood pressure: 114/46 mmHg (90/34-115/49 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 14-19 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Cardiac rhythm: Sinus bradycardia

The patient has been receiving fluids and antibiotics, and has been managed for hypernatremia, hypotension, hyperglycemia, and diabetic ketoacidosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Septic shock: Given the patient's fever and hypotension, there is a risk of septic shock, which can be life-threatening.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and there is a risk of respiratory failure, particularly if the patient's oxygen saturation drops.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus bradycardia, which may be a sign of cardiac instability. There is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
4. Renal failure: The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney damage. There is a risk of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Infection: The patient has a fever, which may be a sign of infection. There is a risk of developing a nosocomial infection, particularly given the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, which may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Thrombosis: The patient is at risk of developing thrombosis, particularly given the use of heparin for prophylaxis.

In summary, the patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical condition, and there are several potential medical complications that can arise from their condition. It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent or manage these complications effectively."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 87 yo male s/p CVA, nonverbal, with HTN, type 2 DM who
   presents with high fevers, likely secondary to cellulitis.
   Additionally has hypernatremia and acute renal failure likely secondary
   to dehydration.
   1.  Cellulitis.  Patient with significant warmth and and erythema over
   right lower extremity.
   - doppler to r/o concurrent DVT
   - blood cultures
   - vanco
   2.  Fever/Leukocytosis.  Likely source of infection is cellulitis,
   however, pneumonia remains a possibility given chest CT findings.
   Patient at high risk for aspiration given AMS.  Also concern for
   purulent drainage from PEG.
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures, sputum culture
   - f/u cultures from PEG site
   - vanco/cefepime/levo (PCN allergy) for broad spectrum coverage
   3.  Hypotension.  Hypotension likely secondary to poor PO intake over
   several weeks in addition to sepsis from infection (likely cellulitis).
   - IVF bolus
   - Levophed to keep MAPS > 65 if needed
   - hold antihypertensives (lisinopril, amlodipine, flomax)
   - hold baclofen
   4.  Hypernatremia.  Significant hypernatremia likely refects ongoing
   infection and poor PO intake over the course of several days to week.
   Given that patient remains markedly hypovolemic, will continue with NS.
   When volume replete, will change to 1/2NS (as hyperglycemia was a
   concern).
   - NS bolus to keeps MAPS> 60
   - free water flushes through PEG
   - q8 hour sodium
   5.  Renal failure.  Creatinine rose after getting 5L NS in ED and in
   MICU.  Likely from profound dehydration and possible sepsis in setting
   of cellulitis.
   - follow Cr
   - IVF boluses to keep MAPs > 65
   - check urine lytes
   6. Hyperglycemia.  Patient is a type 2 diabetic.  No evidence of DKA.
   Likely elevated in setting of infection
   - Lantus + HISS
   - follow fingersticks
   - while uptitrating tube feeds, will give lantus at reduced dose (10
   instead of 14); will give 14 tomorrow night
   7.  AMS.  Likely secondary to s/p CVA in [**2109**], s/p traumatic SDH x 2,
   significant hypernatremia, and infection.  Head CT showed no acute
   process.
   - IVF boluses to correct hypernatremia
   - continue aricept
   - vanco/cefepime/levo for infection
   8.  Thrombocytopenia.  Unknown baseline.  Platelet count most recent
   was 137 on [**3-15**].
   - peripheral smear
   - DIC labs
   - minimize offending meds
   - obtain baseline from [**Hospital 590**] rehab
   9.  Anemia.  Unclear baseline.
   - trend Hct
   - iron studies
   - guiaic stools
   10.  Troponin leak.  When afebrile and s/p 5L NS, HR has fallen to
   40s.  No prior EKG for comparison but no evidence of ACS.  Likely
   demand ischemia in setting of infection and tachcardia.
   - follow troponins
   11.  Sacral decub.
   - wound care nurse

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 87 yo male s/p CVA, nonverbal, with HTN, type 2 DM who
   presents with high fevers, likely secondary to cellulitis.
   Additionally has hypernatremia and acute renal failure likely secondary
   to dehydration.
   1.  Cellulitis.  Patient with significant warmth and and erythema over
   right lower extremity.
   - doppler to r/o concurrent DVT
   - blood cultures
   - vanco
   2.  Fever/Leukocytosis.  Likely source of infection is cellulitis,
   however, pneumonia remains a possibility given chest CT findings.
   Patient at high risk for aspiration given AMS.  Also concern for
   purulent drainage from PEG.
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures, sputum culture
   - f/u cultures from PEG site
   - vanco/cefepime/levo (PCN allergy) for broad spectrum coverage
   3.  Hypotension.  Hypotension likely secondary to poor PO intake over
   several weeks in addition to sepsis from infection (likely cellulitis).
   - IVF bolus
   - Levophed to keep MAPS > 65 if needed
   - hold antihypertensives (lisinopril, amlodipine, flomax)
   - hold baclofen
   4.  Hypernatremia.  Significant hypernatremia likely refects ongoing
   infection and poor PO intake over the course of several days to week.
   Given that patient remains markedly hypovolemic, will continue with NS.
   When volume replete, will change to 1/2NS (as hyperglycemia was a
   concern).
   - NS bolus to keeps MAPS> 60
   - free water flushes through PEG
   - q8 hour sodium
   5.  Renal failure.  Creatinine rose after getting 5L NS in ED and in
   MICU.  Likely from profound dehydration and possible sepsis in setting
   of cellulitis.
   - follow Cr
   - IVF boluses to keep MAPs > 65
   - check urine lytes
   6. Hyperglycemia.  Patient is a type 2 diabetic.  No evidence of DKA.
   Likely elevated in setting of infection
   - Lantus + HISS
   - follow fingersticks
   - while uptitrating tube feeds, will give lantus at reduced dose (10
   instead of 14); will give 14 tomorrow night
   7.  AMS.  Likely secondary to s/p CVA in [**2109**], s/p traumatic SDH x 2,
   significant hypernatremia, and infection.  Head CT showed no acute
   process.
   - IVF boluses to correct hypernatremia
   - continue aricept
   - vanco/cefepime/levo for infection
   8.  Thrombocytopenia.  Unknown baseline.  Platelet count most recent
   was 137 on [**3-15**].
   - peripheral smear
   - DIC labs
   - minimize offending meds
   - obtain baseline from [**Hospital 590**] rehab
   9.  Anemia.  Unclear baseline.
   - trend Hct
   - iron studies
   - guiaic stools
   10.  Troponin leak.  When afebrile and s/p 5L NS, HR has fallen to
   40s.  No prior EKG for comparison but no evidence of ACS.  Likely
   demand ischemia in setting of infection and tachcardia.
   - follow troponins
   11.  Sacral decub.
   - wound care nurse

   Disposition: ICU care for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male who presents with high fevers, likely secondary to cellulitis, and is experiencing hypernatremia and acute renal failure likely due to dehydration. The patient has a complex medical history, including a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), traumatic subdural hematoma (SDH), and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's high fevers and leukocytosis suggest a possible septic response, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's chest CT findings and fever suggest a possible pneumonia, which can complicate his condition and worsen his respiratory status.
3. Aspiration: The patient's altered mental status (AMS) and risk of aspiration from his PEG tube can lead to respiratory compromise and pneumonia.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia can worsen his condition and increase his risk of complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
5. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can worsen his condition and increase his risk of complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can increase his risk of bleeding and worsen his condition.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen his condition and increase his risk of complications, such as heart failure and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
8. Troponin leak: The patient's troponin leak can indicate cardiac damage and increase his risk of complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias.
9. Sacral decubitus: The patient's sacral decubitus can lead to wound complications and increase his risk of infection.

The patient's treatment plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, IV fluids, and close monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory results. The patient's family has been informed of his condition and has been advised to follow up with his healthcare team regularly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 87 yo male s/p CVA, nonverbal, with HTN, type 2 DM who
   presents with high fevers, likely secondary to cellulitis.
   Additionally has hypernatremia and acute renal failure likely secondary
   to dehydration.
   1.  Cellulitis.  Patient with significant warmth and and erythema over
   right lower extremity.
   - doppler to r/o concurrent DVT
   - blood cultures
   - vanco
   2.  Fever/Leukocytosis.  Likely source of infection is cellulitis,
   however, pneumonia remains a possibility given chest CT findings.
   Patient at high risk for aspiration given AMS.  Also concern for
   purulent drainage from PEG.
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures, sputum culture
   - f/u cultures from PEG site
   - vanco/cefepime/levo (PCN allergy) for broad spectrum coverage
   3.  Hypotension.  Hypotension likely secondary to poor PO intake over
   several weeks in addition to sepsis from infection (likely cellulitis).
   - IVF bolus
   - Levophed to keep MAPS > 65 if needed
   - hold antihypertensives (lisinopril, amlodipine, flomax)
   - hold baclofen
   4.  Hypernatremia.  Significant hypernatremia likely refects ongoing
   infection and poor PO intake over the course of several days to week.
   Given that patient remains markedly hypovolemic, will continue with NS.
   When volume replete, will change to 1/2NS (as hyperglycemia was a
   concern).
   - NS bolus to keeps MAPS> 60
   - free water flushes through PEG
   - q8 hour sodium
   5.  Renal failure.  Creatinine rose after getting 5L NS in ED and in
   MICU.  Likely from profound dehydration and possible sepsis in setting
   of cellulitis.
   - follow Cr
   - IVF boluses to keep MAPs > 65
   - check urine lytes
   6. Hyperglycemia.  Patient is a type 2 diabetic.  No evidence of DKA.
   Likely elevated in setting of infection
   - Lantus + HISS
   - follow fingersticks
   - while uptitrating tube feeds, will give lantus at reduced dose (10
   instead of 14); will give 14 tomorrow night
   7.  AMS.  Likely secondary to s/p CVA in [**2109**], s/p traumatic SDH x 2,
   significant hypernatremia, and infection.  Head CT showed no acute
   process.
   - IVF boluses to correct hypernatremia
   - continue aricept
   - vanco/cefepime/levo for infection
   8.  Thrombocytopenia.  Unknown baseline.  Platelet count most recent
   was 137 on [**3-15**].
   - peripheral smear
   - DIC labs
   - minimize offending meds
   - obtain baseline from [**Hospital 590**] rehab
   9.  Anemia.  Unclear baseline.
   - trend Hct
   - iron studies
   - guiaic stools
   10.  Troponin leak.  When afebrile and s/p 5L NS, HR has fallen to
   40s.  No prior EKG for comparison but no evidence of ACS.  Likely
   demand ischemia in setting of infection and tachcardia.
   - follow troponins
   11.  Sacral decub.
   - wound care nurse

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 87 yo M s/p CVA, nonverbal, with HTN, type 2 DM who presents
   with fever to 106, likely secondary to extensive LE cellulitis.
   Additionally has hypernatremia and acute renal failure likely secondary
   to dehydration.
   #   Fever / Leukocytosis:
   Likely attributed to cellulitis. Patient with significant warmth and
   and erythema over right lower extremity at presentation. Now with
   decrease in WBC from 14 to 10.9 and has been afebrile following
   admission. Despite cellulitis being most likely cause of fever and
   leukocytosis, pneumonia (given chest CT) and peri-PEG infection (given
   purulent drainage around PEG). RLE U/S negative as source of
   fever/cellulitis.  CXR without evidence of PNA, likely atelectasis at
   LLL.
   - Continue Vanc, cefepime
   - d/c levo
   - Follow-up blood cultures
 currently negative
   - Follow-up wound cultures from PEG site
 GM stain GPC/GNR
   - RLE doppler negative for DVT as source of cellulitis
   - follow fever curve.  Remains afebrile
   #  Hypotension / Bradycardia:
   Hypotension likely secondary to poor PO intake over several weeks in
   addition to sepsis from infection (likely cellulitis). Does not appear
   to be linked to bradycardia (baseline HR in low 50s) at this time;
   however, will continue to monitor.  BP stable while in MICU.
   - IVF boluses as needed
   - Hold antihypertensives (lisinopril, amlodipine, flomax) and baclofen
   # VT code:
   Patient with episode of pulseless/unresponsive VT on [**3-25**] 7PM, code
   called, no shock delivered, CPR initiated but stopped immediately after
   initiation due to pt spontaneous recovery of pulse.  Awake and
   responsive afterwards, post-code EKG without ST elevations, appears to
   be intermittent atrial tachy with baseline bradycardia, troponin/CK
   continued trend downward since admission.
   - Cardiology consult
   - Echo today
   - Cont telemetry
   #  Hypernatremia:
   Significant hypernatremia likely reflects ongoing infection and poor PO
   intake over the course of several days to week. Initially received NS
   for rehydration. Now that pressures are maintained without need for
   frequent boluses, will hold on further IVF and manage hypernatremia
   with free water via PEG.  Trending downward slowly.
   - Free water flushes through PEG
   - cont daily electrolytes check
   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Creatinine rose after getting 5L NS in ED and in MICU. Has fallen
   slightly to 1.1 upon 0900 labs this AM.  Likely from profound
   dehydration and possible sepsis in setting of cellulitis.  Creatinine
   trended downward to normal over course of rehydration.
   - Follow-up Cr with ongoing hydration via PEG and daily electrolytes
   checks
   # Hyperglycemia:
   Patient is a type 2 diabetic.  No evidence of DKA.  Likely elevated in
   setting of infection.  Taken off insulin gtt without complications.
   FSBG trending into acceptable range in sliding scale and lantus.
   - Lantus + HISS and uptitrate doses as needed. Will set lantus at 14 U
   tonight to cover increased tube feeds.
   - QID fingersticks
   #  AMS:
   Unknown recent baseline. Likely secondary to s/p CVA in [**2109**], s/p
   traumatic SDH x 2, significant hypernatremia, and infection.  Head CT
   showed no acute process.  Mental status improved over course of MICU
   stay with hydration and treatment of infection.
   - Continue donepezil
   - vanco/cefepime for infection
   # Hypocalcemia:
   Corrected Ca of 7.3 this AM.  Remained stable without issues
   - Replete and recheck Ca on PM lytes
   #  Thrombocytopenia:
   Unknown baseline.  Platelet count most recent was 137 on [**3-15**]. Is 93
   this AM, stable in 90
s. DIC labs negative yesterday for signs of DIC.
   - Follow-up peripheral smear
   - Cont to follow plts.  Unlikely DIC at this point.
   # Anemia:
   Unclear baseline. Down slightly to 31.4 from 35.5 at admission. Not
   iron deficient by labs (ferritin 1478 and FeSat = 44%).
   - Trend HCT, stable
   - Guiaic stools
   # Troponin leak:
   When afebrile and s/p 5L NS, HR has fallen to 40s.  No prior EKG for
   comparison but no evidence of ACS.  Likely demand ischemia in setting
   of infection and tachcardia. Troponin at presentation was 0.07 and was
   0.05 this AM.
   - Continued downward trend of troponin post-VT code, unlikely MI
   #  Sacral decubitis ulcer:

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 87 yo M s/p CVA, nonverbal, with HTN, type 2 DM who presents
   with fever to 106, likely secondary to extensive LE cellulitis.
   Additionally has hypernatremia and acute renal failure likely secondary
   to dehydration.
   #   Fever / Leukocytosis:
   Likely attributed to cellulitis. Patient with significant warmth and
   and erythema over right lower extremity at presentation. Now with
   decrease in WBC from 14 to 10.9 and has been afebrile following
   admission. Despite cellulitis being most likely cause of fever and
   leukocytosis, pneumonia (given chest CT) and peri-PEG infection (given
   purulent drainage around PEG). RLE U/S negative as source of
   fever/cellulitis.  CXR without evidence of PNA, likely atelectasis at
   LLL.
   - Continue Vanc, cefepime
   - d/c levo
   - Follow-up blood cultures
 currently negative
   - Follow-up wound cultures from PEG site
 GM stain GPC/GNR
   - RLE doppler negative for DVT as source of cellulitis
   - follow fever curve.  Remains afebrile
   #  Hypotension / Bradycardia:
   Hypotension likely secondary to poor PO intake over several weeks in
   addition to sepsis from infection (likely cellulitis). Does not appear
   to be linked to bradycardia (baseline HR in low 50s) at this time;
   however, will continue to monitor.  BP stable while in MICU.
   - IVF boluses as needed
   - Hold antihypertensives (lisinopril, amlodipine, flomax) and baclofen
   # VT code:
   Patient with episode of pulseless/unresponsive VT on [**3-25**] 7PM, code
   called, no shock delivered, CPR initiated but stopped immediately after
   initiation due to pt spontaneous recovery of pulse.  Awake and
   responsive afterwards, post-code EKG without ST elevations, appears to
   be intermittent atrial tachy with baseline bradycardia, troponin/CK
   continued trend downward since admission.
   - Cardiology consult
   - Echo today
   - Cont telemetry
   #  Hypernatremia:
   Significant hypernatremia likely reflects ongoing infection and poor PO
   intake over the course of several days to week. Initially received NS
   for rehydration. Now that pressures are maintained without need for
   frequent boluses, will hold on further IVF and manage hypernatremia
   with free water via PEG.  Trending downward slowly.
   - Free water flushes through PEG
   - cont daily electrolytes check
   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Creatinine rose after getting 5L NS in ED and in MICU. Has fallen
   slightly to 1.1 upon 0900 labs this AM.  Likely from profound
   dehydration and possible sepsis in setting of cellulitis.  Creatinine
   trended downward to normal over course of rehydration.
   - Follow-up Cr with ongoing hydration via PEG and daily electrolytes
   checks
   # Hyperglycemia:
   Patient is a type 2 diabetic.  No evidence of DKA.  Likely elevated in
   setting of infection.  Taken off insulin gtt without complications.
   FSBG trending into acceptable range in sliding scale and lantus.
   - Lantus + HISS and uptitrate doses as needed. Will set lantus at 14 U
   tonight to cover increased tube feeds.
   - QID fingersticks
   #  AMS:
   Unknown recent baseline. Likely secondary to s/p CVA in [**2109**], s/p
   traumatic SDH x 2, significant hypernatremia, and infection.  Head CT
   showed no acute process.  Mental status improved over course of MICU
   stay with hydration and treatment of infection.
   - Continue donepezil
   - vanco/cefepime for infection
   # Hypocalcemia:
   Corrected Ca of 7.3 this AM.  Remained stable without issues
   - Replete and recheck Ca on PM lytes
   #  Thrombocytopenia:
   Unknown baseline.  Platelet count most recent was 137 on [**3-15**]. Is 93
   this AM, stable in 90
s. DIC labs negative yesterday for signs of DIC.
   - Follow-up peripheral smear
   - Cont to follow plts.  Unlikely DIC at this point.
   # Anemia:
   Unclear baseline. Down slightly to 31.4 from 35.5 at admission. Not
   iron deficient by labs (ferritin 1478 and FeSat = 44%).
   - Trend HCT, stable
   - Guiaic stools
   # Troponin leak:
   When afebrile and s/p 5L NS, HR has fallen to 40s.  No prior EKG for
   comparison but no evidence of ACS.  Likely demand ischemia in setting
   of infection and tachcardia. Troponin at presentation was 0.07 and was
   0.05 this AM.
   - Continued downward trend of troponin post-VT code, unlikely MI
   #  Sacral decubitis ulcer:
   - Wound care via nursing
   ICU Care

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male who presented with fever to 106, likely secondary to extensive LE cellulitis. He has a history of CVA, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, and blood pressure of 115/56 mmHg.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac issues: The patient had an episode of pulseless/unresponsive VT, which resolved spontaneously. He has been experiencing atrial tachycardia with baseline bradycardia, and his troponin/CK levels are trending downward. A cardiology consult and echocardiogram have been ordered to further evaluate his cardiac status.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure likely secondary to dehydration and sepsis. His creatinine level has risen and fallen slightly, and he is being managed with hydration via PEG and daily electrolyte checks.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has significant hypernatremia likely reflecting ongoing infection and poor PO intake. He is being managed with free water flushes through PEG and daily electrolyte checks.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient is a type 2 diabetic and has elevated blood glucose levels, which are being managed with a sliding scale and Lantus.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 93, which is stable but unknown baseline. A follow-up peripheral smear and continued monitoring of platelets are planned.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased slightly, but his iron deficiency is unlikely based on lab results. Trending HCT and guaiac stools are planned.
7. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, which is being managed with wound care via nursing.
8. Potential infections: The patient has a history of cellulitis, and his WBC count has decreased from 14 to 10.9. He is being managed with antibiotics and follow-up wound cultures.

In terms of plan, the patient will continue to receive Vanc and cefepime for infection, and his antibiotics will be adjusted as needed. He will also receive a cardiology consult and echocardiogram to further evaluate his cardiac status. The patient's hypernatremia will be managed with free water flushes through PEG and daily electrolyte checks. His hyperglycemia will be managed with a sliding scale and Lantus. The patient's thrombocytopenia will be monitored, and his anemia will be trended. The sacral decubitus ulcer will be managed with wound care via nursing."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 87 yo M s/p CVA, nonverbal, with HTN, type 2 DM who presents
   with fever to 106, likely secondary to extensive LE cellulitis.
   Additionally has hypernatremia and acute renal failure likely secondary
   to dehydration.
   #   Fever / Leukocytosis:
   Likely attributed to cellulitis. Patient with significant warmth and
   and erythema over right lower extremity at presentation. Now with
   decrease in WBC from 14 to 10.9 and has been afebrile following
   admission. Despite cellulitis being most likely cause of fever and
   leukocytosis, pneumonia (given chest CT) and peri-PEG infection (given
   purulent drainage around PEG). RLE U/S negative as source of
   fever/cellulitis.
   - Continue Vanc, cefepime, levofloxacin
   - Follow-up blood cultures
 currently negative
   - Follow-up wound cultures from PEG site
 GM stain GPC/GNR
   - RLE doppler negative for DVT as source of cellulitis
   #  Hypotension / Bradycardia:
   Hypotension likely secondary to poor PO intake over several weeks in
   addition to sepsis from infection (likely cellulitis). Does not appear
   to be linked to bradycardia (baseline HR in low 50s) at this time;
   however, will continue to monitor.
   - IVF boluses as needed
   - Hold antihypertensives (lisinopril, amlodipine, flomax) and baclofen
   # VT code:
   Patient with episode of pulseless/unresponsive VT on [**3-25**] 7PM, code
   called, no shock delivered, CPR initiated but stopped immediately after
   initiation due to pt spontaneous recovery of pulse.  Awake and
   responsive afterwards, post-code EKG without ST elevations, appears to
   be intermittent atrial tachy with baseline bradycardia, troponin/CK
   continued trend downward since admission.
   - Cardiology consult
   - Cont telemetry
   #  Hypernatremia:
   Significant hypernatremia likely reflects ongoing infection and poor PO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 87 yo M s/p CVA, nonverbal, with HTN, type 2 DM who presents
   with fever to 106, likely secondary to extensive LE cellulitis.
   Additionally has hypernatremia and acute renal failure likely secondary
   to dehydration.
   #   Fever / Leukocytosis:
   Likely attributed to cellulitis. Patient with significant warmth and
   and erythema over right lower extremity at presentation. Now with
   decrease in WBC from 14 to 10.9 and has been afebrile following
   admission. Despite cellulitis being most likely cause of fever and
   leukocytosis, pneumonia (given chest CT) and peri-PEG infection (given
   purulent drainage around PEG). RLE U/S negative as source of
   fever/cellulitis.
   - Continue Vanc, cefepime, levofloxacin
   - Follow-up blood cultures
 currently negative
   - Follow-up wound cultures from PEG site
 GM stain GPC/GNR
   - RLE doppler negative for DVT as source of cellulitis
   #  Hypotension / Bradycardia:
   Hypotension likely secondary to poor PO intake over several weeks in
   addition to sepsis from infection (likely cellulitis). Does not appear
   to be linked to bradycardia (baseline HR in low 50s) at this time;
   however, will continue to monitor.
   - IVF boluses as needed
   - Hold antihypertensives (lisinopril, amlodipine, flomax) and baclofen
   # VT code:
   Patient with episode of pulseless/unresponsive VT on [**3-25**] 7PM, code
   called, no shock delivered, CPR initiated but stopped immediately after
   initiation due to pt spontaneous recovery of pulse.  Awake and
   responsive afterwards, post-code EKG without ST elevations, appears to
   be intermittent atrial tachy with baseline bradycardia, troponin/CK
   continued trend downward since admission.
   - Cardiology consult
   - Cont telemetry
   #  Hypernatremia:
   Significant hypernatremia likely reflects ongoing infection and poor PO
   intake over the course of several days to week. Initially received NS
   for rehydration. Now that pressures are maintained without need for
   frequent boluses, will hold on further IVF and manage hypernatremia
   with free water via PEG.  Trending downward slowly.
   - Free water flushes through PEG
   - Q8H sodium check
   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Creatinine rose after getting 5L NS in ED and in MICU. Has fallen
   slightly to 1.1 upon 0900 labs this AM.  Likely from profound
   dehydration and possible sepsis in setting of cellulitis.
   - Follow-up Cr with PM lytes and ongoing hydration via PEG
   # Hyperglycemia:
   Patient is a type 2 diabetic.  No evidence of DKA.  Likely elevated in
   setting of infection.
   - Lantus + HISS and uptitrate doses as needed. Will set lantus at 14 U
   tonight to cover increased tube feeds.
   - QID fingersticks
   #  AMS:
   Unknown recent baseline. Likely secondary to s/p CVA in [**2109**], s/p
   traumatic SDH x 2, significant hypernatremia, and infection.  Head CT
   showed no acute process.
   - Continue donepezil
   - vanco/cefepime/levo for infection
   # Hypocalcemia:
   Corrected Ca of 7.3 this AM.
   - Replete and recheck Ca on PM lytes
   #  Thrombocytopenia:
   Unknown baseline.  Platelet count most recent was 137 on [**3-15**]. Is 93
   this AM. DIC labs negative yesterday for signs of DIC.
   - Follow-up peripheral smear
   - Recheck PLT on PM labs
   - Minimize offending meds
   - Obtain baseline PLT count from [**Hospital 590**] rehab
   # Anemia:
   Unclear baseline. Down slightly to 31.4 from 35.5 at admission. Not
   iron deficient by labs (ferritin 1478 and FeSat = 44%).
   - Trend HCT
   - Guiaic stools
   # Troponin leak:
   When afebrile and s/p 5L NS, HR has fallen to 40s.  No prior EKG for
   comparison but no evidence of ACS.  Likely demand ischemia in setting
   of infection and tachcardia. Troponin at presentation was 0.07 and was
   0.05 this AM.
   - Continued downward trend of troponin post-VT code, unlikely MI

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male who presents with fever, likely secondary to extensive left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis, and hypernatremia and acute renal failure likely due to dehydration. The patient has a history of CVA, nonverbal, with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and is currently on antibiotics, including Vanc, cefepime, and levofloxacin.

The patient had a VT code at 7 PM on [**3-25**], which was successfully treated without shock delivery, and the patient recovered pulse on their own. The post-code EKG showed no ST elevations, and the patient's troponin and CK levels have been trending downward since admission.

The patient has hypernatremia, which is likely due to ongoing infection and poor oral intake over several days to a week. The patient has also been experiencing hypotension, which is likely secondary to poor oral intake and sepsis from infection.

The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, which requires wound care via nursing. The patient's laboratory results show thrombocytopenia, anemia, and hyperglycemia, which are likely secondary to infection and dehydration.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension suggest sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to dehydration and sepsis, and may require further treatment, such as dialysis.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's VT code and bradycardia suggest cardiac instability, which may require further monitoring and treatment.
4. Infection: The patient's cellulitis and sacral decubitus ulcer require ongoing treatment and monitoring to prevent further infection and complications.
5. Dehydration: The patient's hypernatremia and hypotension suggest dehydration, which may require further treatment, such as IV fluids and electrolyte replacement.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may require further monitoring and treatment to prevent bleeding complications.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may require further treatment, such as blood transfusions, to prevent complications.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may require further treatment, such as insulin therapy, to prevent complications.

Overall, the patient requires ongoing close monitoring and treatment to prevent further complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 87 yo M s/p CVA, nonverbal, with HTN, type 2 DM who presents
   with fever to 106, likely secondary to extensive LE cellulitis.
   Additionally has hypernatremia and acute renal failure likely secondary
   to dehydration.
   #   Fever / Leukocytosis:
   Likely attributed to cellulitis. Patient with significant warmth and
   and erythema over right lower extremity at presentation. Now with
   decrease in WBC from 14 to 10.9 and has been afebrile following
   admission. Despite cellulitis being most likely cause of fever and
   leukocytosis, pneumonia (given chest CT) and peri-PEG infection (given
   purulent drainage around PEG). RLE U/S negative as source of
   fever/cellulitis.
   - Continue Vanc, cefepime, levofloxacin
   - Follow-up blood cultures
 currently negative
   - Follow-up wound cultures from PEG site
 GM stain GPC/GNR
   - RLE doppler negative for DVT as source of cellulitis
   #  Hypotension / Bradycardia:
   Hypotension likely secondary to poor PO intake over several weeks in
   addition to sepsis from infection (likely cellulitis). Does not appear
   to be linked to bradycardia (baseline HR in low 50s) at this time;
   however, will continue to monitor.
   - IVF boluses as needed
   - Hold antihypertensives (lisinopril, amlodipine, flomax) and baclofen
   # VT code:
   Patient with episode of pulseless/unresponsive VT on [**3-25**] 7PM, code
   called, no shock delivered, CPR initiated but stopped immediately after
   initiation due to pt spontaneous recovery of pulse.  Awake and
   responsive afterwards, post-code EKG without ST elevations, appears to
   be intermittent atrial tachy with baseline bradycardia, troponin/CK
   continued trend downward since admission.
   - Cardiology consult
   - Cont telemetry
   #  Hypernatremia:
   Significant hypernatremia likely reflects ongoing infection and poor PO
   intake over the course of several days to week. Initially received NS
   for rehydration. Now that pressures are maintained without need for
   frequent boluses, will hold on further IVF and manage hypernatremia
   with free water via PEG.  Trending downward slowly.
   - Free water flushes through PEG
   - Q8H sodium check
   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Creatinine rose after getting 5L NS in ED and in MICU. Has fallen
   slightly to 1.1 upon 0900 labs this AM.  Likely from profound
   dehydration and possible sepsis in setting of cellulitis.
   - Follow-up Cr with PM lytes and ongoing hydration via PEG
   # Hyperglycemia:
   Patient is a type 2 diabetic.  No evidence of DKA.  Likely elevated in
   setting of infection.
   - Lantus + HISS and uptitrate doses as needed. Will set lantus at 14 U
   tonight to cover increased tube feeds.
   - QID fingersticks
   #  AMS:
   Unknown recent baseline. Likely secondary to s/p CVA in [**2109**], s/p
   traumatic SDH x 2, significant hypernatremia, and infection.  Head CT
   showed no acute process.
   - Continue donepezil
   - vanco/cefepime/levo for infection
   # Hypocalcemia:
   Corrected Ca of 7.3 this AM.
   - Replete and recheck Ca on PM lytes
   #  Thrombocytopenia:
   Unknown baseline.  Platelet count most recent was 137 on [**3-15**]. Is 93
   this AM. DIC labs negative yesterday for signs of DIC.
   - Follow-up peripheral smear
   - Recheck PLT on PM labs
   - Minimize offending meds
   - Obtain baseline PLT count from [**Hospital 590**] rehab
   # Anemia:
   Unclear baseline. Down slightly to 31.4 from 35.5 at admission. Not
   iron deficient by labs (ferritin 1478 and FeSat = 44%).
   - Trend HCT
   - Guiaic stools
   # Troponin leak:
   When afebrile and s/p 5L NS, HR has fallen to 40s.  No prior EKG for
   comparison but no evidence of ACS.  Likely demand ischemia in setting
   of infection and tachcardia. Troponin at presentation was 0.07 and was
   0.05 this AM.
   - Continued downward trend of troponin post-VT code, unlikely MI
   #  Sacral decubitis ulcer:

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following key points:

1. The patient is an 87-year-old male who presented with fever to 106°F, likely secondary to extensive left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis.
2. He has hypernatremia and acute renal failure, likely secondary to dehydration.
3. The patient had a VT code on [**3-25**] 7PM, but no shock was delivered, and CPR was initiated, but stopped immediately after the patient's spontaneous recovery of pulse.
4. The patient has been afebrile since admission, and his WBC count has decreased from 14 to 10.9.
5. He has hyperglycemia, likely elevated in the setting of infection.
6. The patient has anemia, with a decreased Hct from 35.5 to 31.4.
7. He has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 93, and DIC labs are negative.
8. The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, which is being managed with wound care.
9. The patient is receiving IV antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin, and is being followed up with blood cultures and wound cultures.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's infection may worsen, leading to sepsis, which can cause organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress, requiring dialysis or other interventions to manage his electrolyte imbalances.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen, particularly if he continues to have poor oral intake and sepsis.
4. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may worsen, potentially leading to cardiac arrest or other cardiac complications.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen, potentially leading to diabetic ketoacidosis or other complications.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, potentially leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, or other complications.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, potentially leading to bleeding complications.
8. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer may worsen, potentially leading to infection, sepsis, or other complications.
9. Cardiac complications: The patient's VT code and troponin leak may indicate underlying cardiac issues, which may worsen over time, potentially leading to cardiac arrest or other complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of V-tach cardiac arrest, likely episodes of atrial tachycardia, and a baseline possible junctional rhythm. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 115/56 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery, with an ABG showing a pH of 7.22.

The patient has a history of hypernatremia, hypotension, hyperglycemia, and diabetic ketoacidosis. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase, as well as elevated levels of troponin-T and C-reactive protein.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the patient's unresponsiveness and inability to assess peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems. The patient's laboratory results show a mild anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and mild kidney injury.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of cardiac arrest and ongoing arrhythmias, there is a risk of further cardiac complications, such as ventricular fibrillation or asystole.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein suggest the possibility of infection, which could worsen the patient's condition.
3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels suggest the possibility of acute kidney injury, which could progress to chronic kidney disease.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and hypercapnia could worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's unresponsiveness and inability to assess neurological systems suggest the possibility of neurological complications, such as stroke or seizure.
6. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could worsen the patient's condition.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and mild kidney injury suggest the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could worsen the patient's condition.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to continue monitoring their vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings closely to identify any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent worsening of the patient's condition."
