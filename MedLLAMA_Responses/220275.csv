You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, and recent pseudomonas bacteremia. She has experienced a right anterior MCA infarct, likely cardioembolic, and is currently in critical condition.

The patient is at high risk for herniation due to the midline shift demonstrated on CT scan. She has been spoken to about her poor prognosis, and her family has decided against aggressive care, but not comfort care.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

* Respiratory failure
* Bradycardia
* Hypotension
* Acute stroke
* Right upper extremity arterial clot
* Hypothyroidism
* Acute on chronic renal failure

The patient is currently receiving the following medications:

* Esmolol
* Heparin
* Albuterol
* Acetaminophen
* Insulin
* Lorazepam
* Levothyroxine
* Pantoprazole
* Aspirin
* Ipratropium
* Piperacillin-Tazobactam
* Vancomycin
* Ciprofloxacin

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated troponin-T levels
* Elevated CK and CKMB levels
* Abnormal differential count
* Elevated lactic acid levels
* Abnormal electrolyte levels (Ca++, Mg++, PO4)

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue ASA 325mg daily
* Hold Coumadin for 5-10 days due to high risk of hemorrhagic transformation
* Allow BP autoregulation and keep SBP < 220
* Maintain tight glycemic control and T < 100.5
* Continue to follow with exam for right upper extremity arterial clot
* Discontinue Esmolol and consider restarting if BP < 140
* Discontinue Vancomycin as no septic source identified
* Continue Zosyn and Cipro
* Monitor urine output and consider differential diagnosis of pre-renal vs. embolic
* Continue levothyroxine for hypothyroidism
* Monitor for signs of herniation and consider transfer to Stroke Service

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Herniation due to the midline shift on CT scan
* Hemorrhagic transformation due to the patient's aortic stenosis and anticoagulation
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia
* Sepsis due to the patient's bacteremia
* Renal failure due to the patient's acute on chronic renal failure
* Hypothyroidism due to the patient's hypothyroidism and potential medication changes
* Stroke due to the patient's aortic stenosis and cardioembolic event

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her care plan accordingly to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   89 year old woman with hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,
   aortic stenosis, recent pseudomonas bacteremia, presenting with nausea,
   vomiting, bradycardia, hypotension and respiratory failure, in critical
   condition. [**2121-10-24**] patient experienced R anterior MCA infarct.
   .
   # STROKE: CTA with perfusion prelim report demonstrates right
   hemispheric infarct of the anterior middle cerebral artery
   distribution. Occlusion of the intracranial right internal carotid
   artery. Most likely cardioembolic related to A Fib. Neurology Stroke
   service following and appreciate recommendations.
   - Continue ASA 325mg daily
   - Coumadin should be held for 5-10 days due to high risk of hemorrhagic
   transformation
   - CT scan demonstrates R hemisphere mass effect R lateral ventricle and
   4 mm leftward shift midline structures - discuss with neuro
   - Allow BP autoregulation - Keep SBP < 220
   - Tight glycemic control and maintain T < 100.5
   .
   # Right upper extremity arterial clot: Palpable radial pulse. Physical
   exam mildly improved since yesterday. No urgent need to embolectomy
   which would require general anesthesia. Can not anticoagulate due to
   acute stroke and high risk of hemorrhage
   - Vascular surgery following and appreciate recommendations
   - Continue to follow with exam
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently in A Fib with RVR.
   -- Continue Esmolol ggt for RVR Goal HR 100-120 with SBP not < 150 in
   setting of acute stroke.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION / HYPOTHERMIA: Resolved, etiology most likely sepsis.
   Patient currently hypertensive in setting of acute stroke. Tmax 99.8,
   WBC 14.7.
   -- Continue Vancomycin and Zosyn, per ID continue Cipro
   -- urine culture final no growth
   -- blood culture no growth so far
   .
   # URINARY TRACT INFECTION: Final urine culture no growth.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: improving, currently 0.9. Decreased
   urine output, differential includes pre-renal vs. embolic. Continue to
   monitor.
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   .
   #FEN: Failed speech and swallow. NPO including meds and ice chips.
   Currently on IV meds. Patient's family discussed wishes not to have NG
   placed for nutrition. Confirm with family can feed patient in setting
   of high aspiration risk.
   .
   #Code: DNR/DNI. Palliative care spoke with family yesterday. Family
   expressed comfort oriented care. Need to discuss with family specific
   medications and there continuation.

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, and recent pseudomonas bacteremia. She has experienced a right anterior MCA infarct, which is likely cardioembolic in origin.

The patient's current condition is critical, with symptoms including nausea, vomiting, bradycardia, hypotension, and respiratory failure. She is currently in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and has a palpable radial pulse in her right upper extremity.

The patient has several potential medical complications that need to be monitored and managed:

1. Stroke: The patient has a right hemisphere infarct, which is likely to worsen if not managed properly. She needs to be closely monitored for signs of increased intracranial pressure, such as headache, vomiting, and decreased level of consciousness.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she has decreased urine output. She needs to be closely monitored for signs of worsening kidney function, such as increasing creatinine levels, oliguria, or anuria.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to her bacteremia and underlying medical conditions. She needs to be closely monitored for signs of sepsis, such as fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has a high risk of developing respiratory failure due to her underlying medical conditions and recent bacteremia. She needs to be closely monitored for signs of worsening respiratory function, such as increasing respiratory rate, decreased oxygen saturation, and increased work of breathing.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and needs to be monitored for signs of worsening hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, cold intolerance, and constipation.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a high risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding due to her bacteremia and underlying medical conditions. She needs to be closely monitored for signs of bleeding, such as hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia.
7. Thromboembolic events: The patient has a high risk of developing thromboembolic events due to her bacteremia and underlying medical conditions. She needs to be closely monitored for signs of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or other thromboembolic events.

In terms of treatment, the patient needs to be managed with a multidisciplinary approach, including cardiology, neurology, infectious disease, and critical care. She needs to be closely monitored for signs of worsening of her condition, and her treatment plan needs to be adjusted accordingly."
