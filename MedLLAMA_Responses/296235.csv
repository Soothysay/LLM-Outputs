   Assessment and Plan
   75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and
   Diagonal), PVD, HTN, admitted with STEMI in perioperative period and
   now with cardiogenic shock s/p IABP.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: CK peaked at .  Patient underwent cath
   with 3 BMS to distal SVG to OM with subsequent persistent low BPs so
   placed on dopamine and IABP.
   - cardiac index 3.3 on arrival to CVICU with dopa 15 and IABP 1:1
   - reassess CI later tonight
   - eval for tamponade now (prelim neg).
   - continue dopa 15 and titrate prn.
   - continue IABP 1:1
   - trend CE - still rising
   - continue ASA 325
   - plavix 600x1 then 75 daily
   - continue heparin gtt without bolus for his IABP
   - continue simvastatin 80
   .
   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis on prelim echo post intervention.
   Support cardiac outpt as above.  LVEDP 25 in lab and pulm edema on CXR
   so will diurese for goal I<O -500 tonight.
   - hold on ACE in setting of ARF
   - afterload reduce with IABP
   - continue dopa for inotrophy
   - consider milrinone if SVR goes up and peripherally clamps down.  Hold
   for now.
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 80s for now.  Hold BB
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure: intubated for airway protection but now with
   hypoxic resp failure.  Suspect underlying obstructive dz from 120 pack
   yrs tobb hx.  Suspect asp pneumonitis and suspect pulm congestion from
   elevated LVEDP
   - continue FiO2 100% and PEEP 10 for O2 sat>92.
   - frequent suctioning
   - monitor Pplateau and Ppeak which have been normal thus far
   - diurese gently
   - MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
   .
   # Aspiration pneumonitis: witnessed aspiration in cath lab and now
   intubated primarily for airway protection.  Although usually a
   chemically mediated process, will treat with abx since large volume
   aspiration and resp failure.
   - vanco/zosyn
   - pan culture
   - taper down abx if able
   - treat resp failure as above.
   .
   # metabolic acidosis: AG 14 so some degree of anion gap acidosis likely
   [**1-1**] lactate.  Delta/delta suggests concomittant nongap likely from
   ARF.  Based on winter's formula, pCO2 should be 31-34 so will increase
   minute ventilation to improve pH.
   - recheck gas after increasing rate to 24 and Vt to 550.
   - likely pressor activity will improve with improvement in acidosis.
   .
   # ARF: baseline Cr 1.3 - now 2.5.  FeNa 5.7 (although had been given
   lasix) suggestive of ATN.  FeUrea 25% suggests prerenal.  regardless,
   suspect poor renal perfusion and ATN.
   - diurese as above for goal -500
   - treat hyperkalemia with insulin IV and recheck
   - monitor daily lytes and renally dose meds
   - monitor for contrast nephropathy in 2-3d
   .
   # question of SVC perforation: [**Month (only) 11**] have occurred during placement of
   cortis.  CXR with no significant widening of mediastinum and echo
   prelim without pericardial effusion.
   - monitor hct and xfuse for <28
   - repeat CXR in am
   - if becomes hypotensive with rising CVP, will consider tamponade as
   etiology and d/w cards team
   .
   # s/p shoulder surgery - pain control w fentanyl bolus prn
   .
   # Ulcerative colitis: continue asacol 1600 [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # depression: celexa
   .
   # hx of GERD: use H2 blocker instead of PPI since plavix
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and a recent STEMI in the perioperative period. He was admitted to the ICU with cardiogenic shock and underwent catheterization with three bare-metal stents placed in the distal SVG to OM. He was placed on dopamine and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support.

The patient's current condition is:

* Cardiogenic shock with persistent low blood pressure
* Cardiac index (CI) 2.8-3.5-2.7, indicating decreased cardiac output
* Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) 65-72, indicating decreased oxygen delivery
* Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10 mmHg, a pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) of 41/18 mmHg, and a cardiac output (CO) of 4.8 L/min
* Respiratory support includes intubation, mechanical ventilation, and FiO2 60%
* Laboratory results show:
	+ Elevated troponin-T (15.22 ng/mL)
	+ Elevated creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB (4078 IU/L)
	+ Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1102 IU/L)
	+ Metabolic acidosis with anion gap (AG) 14
	+ Elevated creatinine (2.5 mg/dL) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (30 mg/dL)
	+ Hyperkalemia (4.1 mEq/L)

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Cardiac complications:
	+ Cardiac tamponade
	+ Cardiac arrest
	+ Ventricular fibrillation
* Respiratory complications:
	+ Respiratory failure
	+ Pneumonia
	+ Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Renal complications:
	+ Acute kidney injury (AKI)
	+ Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
	+ End-stage renal disease (ESRD)
* Metabolic complications:
	+ Hyperkalemia
	+ Metabolic acidosis
	+ Electrolyte imbalance
* Infection complications:
	+ Sepsis
	+ Bacteremia
	+ Pneumonia
* Other complications:
	+ Aspiration pneumonitis
	+ Pulmonary edema
	+ Cardiac output failure

Based on the patient's current condition, the physician's plan includes:

* Continue dopamine and IABP support
* Monitor cardiac output and adjust therapy as needed
* Diurese to achieve a goal of I/O <500 mL
* Treat hyperkalemia with insulin and recheck
* Monitor daily lab results and adjust therapy as needed
* Consider milrinone if SVR increases and peripheral circulation becomes compromised
* Continue respiratory support with mechanical ventilation and FiO2 60%
* Monitor for signs of cardiac tamponade and treat accordingly
* Monitor for signs of respiratory failure and treat accordingly

The patient's family has been informed of his condition and the plan of care."

   Assessment and Plan
   75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and
   Diagonal), PVD, HTN, admitted with STEMI in perioperative period and
   now with cardiogenic shock s/p IABP.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: .Patient underwent cath with 3 BMS to
   distal SVG to OM CK peaked at 6000 and now downtrending. Given severity
   of MI cardiogenic shock is most likely due to ischemia. Hemodynamics
   improved with IABP, but hypotension persists. Doing better now on
   levophed, which may imply some septic physiology as well. Cardiac index
   down to 2.7 from 3.5 but may not be reliable given dramatic shifts in
   O2 saturation and hg.
   - Plan to trial IABP on 1:2 pump
   - D/c Dopamine and continue levophed for septic physiology and
   cardiogenic shock   with goal MAPs 60
   - Repeat Fick calculations
 hour after pump change
   - continue ASA 325
   - plavix 75 daily
   - continue heparin gtt for IABP
   - continue simvastatin 80
   .
   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis on prelim echo post intervention.
   Support cardiac outpt as above.  LVEDP 25 in lab and pulm edema on CXR,
   but patient will require frequent boluses over thecourse of the day.
   - hold on ACE in setting of ARF
   - afterload reduce with IABP
   - consider milrinone if SVR goes up and peripherally clamps down.  Hold
   for now.
   - Goal I/o positive 1-2 liters with boluses as needed
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 80s for now.  Hold BB
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure/Aspiration: Likely due to aspiration in Cath
   lab. Hypoxia likely due to edema, consolidation, and underlying COPD.
   - Wean FiO2 to   nontoxic levels as tolerated
   - frequent suctioning
   - MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
   .
   # Aspiration pneumonitis: witnessed aspiration in cath lab and now
   intubated primarily for airway protection.  Although usually a
   chemically mediated process, will treat with abx since large volume
   aspiration and resp failure.
   - pan culture
   - taper down abx if able
   - treat resp failure as above.
   -  vanco/zosyn
   .
   # metabolic acidosis: AG up to 15 likely from lactate. Delta delta
   suggests nongap acidosis likely due to renal failure.
   - Improvement with dynamics should improve renal failure and lactate
   - trend ABGs daily
   .
   # ARF: baseline Cr 1.3
 stable for last 24 hours at mid 2s.  FeUrea
   25% suggests prerenal.  regardless, suspect poor renal perfusion and

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   improved with IABP, but hypotension persists. Doing better now on
   levophed, which may imply some septic physiology as well. Cardiac index
   down to 2.7 from 3.5 but may not be reliable given dramatic shifts in
   O2 saturation and hg.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old man admitted with a history of CAD, PVD, HTN, and admitted with STEMI in the perioperative period. He underwent catheterization with 3 BMS to the distal SVG to OM, and his CK peaked at 6000. He is currently in cardiogenic shock with a cardiac index of 2.7, and his hemodynamics have improved with the use of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). He is also experiencing hypotension, and his MAPs are less than 40, which is not responsive to IV fluids. He has been started on levophed to help improve his blood pressure.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with a diagnosis of hypoxic respiratory failure and aspiration. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His ABG results show a pH of 7.37, pCO2 of 30, and pO2 of 165, indicating a mild metabolic acidosis. His lactate level is elevated, and his delta delta value suggests a nongap acidosis likely due to renal failure.

The patient's renal function is also concerning, with a baseline creatinine of 1.3 and a recent increase to 2.5. His urine output is decreased, and he is suspected to have acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis, depression, and GERD, and is currently receiving treatment for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac index is low, and he is experiencing hypotension, which may lead to further complications such as cardiac arrest or multi-organ failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, and he is at risk for further complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is at risk for further complications such as chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely due to renal failure, and he is at risk for further complications such as lactic acidosis or hyperkalemia.
5. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and decreased urine output suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to further complications such as organ failure or death.
6. Aspiration pneumonitis: The patient's diagnosis of aspiration pneumonitis is concerning, and he is at risk for further complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
7. Contrast nephropathy: The patient's recent use of contrast media may have caused nephropathy, which could lead to further complications such as chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac index and hemodynamics to ensure that his cardiogenic shock is adequately managed.
2. Continue to provide mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy to manage the patient's respiratory failure.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and urine output to ensure that his ATN is managed appropriately.
4. Continue to manage the patient's metabolic acidosis with IV fluids and electrolyte replacement.
5. Monitor the patient's temperature and white blood cell count to ensure that he is not developing sepsis.
6. Continue to provide pain management with fentanyl and other medications as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide frequent suctioning and bronchodilators as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and
   Diagonal), PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia here with STEMI.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: likely from ischemic cause.  Patient
   underwent cath with 3 BMS to distal SVG to OM with subsequent
   persistent low BPs so placed on dopamine and IABP.
   - cardiac index 3.3 on arrival to CVICU with dopa 15 and IABP 1:1
   - reassess CI later tonight
   - eval for tamponade now (prelim neg).
   - continue dopa 15 and titrate prn.
   - continue IABP 1:1
   - trend CE - still rising
   - continue ASA 325
   - plavix 600x1 then 75 daily
   - continue heparin gtt without bolus for his IABP
   - continue simvastatin 80
   .
   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis on prelim echo post intervention.
   Support cardiac outpt as above.  LVEDP 25 in lab and pulm edema on CXR
   so will diurese for goal I<O -500 tonight.
   - hold on ACE in setting of ARF
   - afterload reduce with IABP
   - continue dopa for inotrophy
   - consider milrinone if SVR goes up and peripherally clamps down.  Hold
   for now.
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 80s for now.  Hold BB
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure: intubated for airway protection but now with
   hypoxic resp failure.  Suspect underlying obstructive dz from 120 pack
   yrs tobb hx.  Suspect asp pneumonitis and suspect pulm congestion from
   elevated LVEDP
   - continue FiO2 100% and PEEP 10 for O2 sat>92.
   - frequent suctioning
   - monitor Pplateau and Ppeak which have been normal thus far
   - diurese gently
   - MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
   .
   # Aspiration pneumonitis: witnessed aspiration in cath lab and now
   intubated primarily for airway protection.  Although usually a
   chemically mediated process, will treat with abx since large volume
   aspiration and resp failure.
   - vanco/zosyn
   - pan culture
   - taper down abx if able
   - treat resp failure as above.
   .
   # metabolic acidosis: AG 14 so some degree of anion gap acidosis likely
   [**1-1**] lactate.  Delta/delta suggests concomittant nongap likely from
   ARF.  Based on winter's formula, pCO2 should be 31-34 so will increase
   minute ventilation to improve pH.
   - recheck gas after increasing rate to 24 and Vt to 550.
   - likely pressor activity will improve with improvement in acidosis.
   .
   # ARF: baseline Cr 1.3 - now 2.5.  FeNa 5.7 (although had been given
   lasix) suggestive of ATN.  FeUrea 25% suggests prerenal.  regardless,
   suspect poor renal perfusion and ATN.
   - diurese as above for goal -500
   - treat hyperkalemia with insulin IV and recheck
   - monitor daily lytes and renally dose meds
   - monitor for contrast nephropathy in 2-3d
   .
   # question of SVC perforation: [**Month (only) 11**] have occurred during placement of
   cortis.  CXR with no significant widening of mediastinum and echo
   prelim without pericardial effusion.
   - monitor hct and xfuse for <28
   - repeat CXR in am
   - if becomes hypotensive with rising CVP, will consider tamponade as
   etiology and d/w cards team
   .
   # s/p shoulder surgery - pain control w fentanyl bolus prn
   .
   # Ulcerative colitis: continue asacol 1600 [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # depression: celexa
   .
   # hx of GERD: use H2 blocker instead of PPI since plavix

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with cardiogenic shock and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is receiving dopamine and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support to improve cardiac output.
2. STEMI: The patient underwent catheterization with placement of three bare-metal stents (BMS) in the distal saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the obtuse marginal (OM) artery.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection and is receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O.
4. Aspiration pneumonitis: The patient aspirated during the catheterization procedure and is being treated with antibiotics and diuretics.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a significant anion gap acidosis with a delta/delta value suggesting concomitant non-gap acidosis from acute kidney injury (AKI).
6. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine was 1.3 mg/dL, and it has increased to 2.5 mg/dL. The patient is receiving diuretics and insulin to manage hyperkalemia.
7. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and is suspected to have underlying obstructive disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's cardiac index is low, and there is a risk of tamponade due to the IABP.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient has elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and is at risk of developing pulmonary edema.
3. Contrast nephropathy: The patient received contrast agents during the catheterization procedure and is at risk of developing contrast nephropathy.
4. Sepsis: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonitis and is at risk of developing sepsis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 66-inch tall individual who is intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. They have a history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, ulcerative colitis, and coronary artery bypass graft. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 76/30 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 96%, and their respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.

The patient's cardiac output is decreased, with a cardiac index of 2.6 L/min/m2. The patient's systemic vascular resistance is increased, with a value of 1,083 dynes*sec/cm5. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is 65-72%.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated troponin-T level, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. The patient's white blood cell count is 12.9 K/uL, and their platelet count is 214 K/uL.

The patient's medical plan includes pain control, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's decreased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance may lead to further cardiac dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's mechanical ventilation and decreased lung compliance may lead to further respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Infection: The patient's decreased immune function and prolonged hospital stay may increase the risk of infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia and central line-associated bloodstream infection.
4. Bleeding: The patient's decreased platelet count and prolonged use of anticoagulant medications may increase the risk of bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage.
5. Renal failure: The patient's decreased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance may lead to decreased renal perfusion and potentially life-threatening complications.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust their medical plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and
   Diagonal), PVD, HTN, admitted with STEMI in perioperative period and
   now with cardiogenic shock s/p IABP.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: .Patient underwent cath with 3 BMS to
   distal SVG to OM CK peaked at 6000 and now downtrending. Given severity
   of MI cardiogenic shock is most likely due to ischemia. Hemodynamics
   improved with IABP, but hypotension persists. Doing better now on
   levophed, which may imply some septic physiology as well. Latest
   CO/CI/SVR @ 0330=7/3.7/700.
   - Plan to con
t  IABP on 1:1-1:2
   - D/c Dopamine and continue levophed, but con
t to wean, with goal MAPs
   60
   - Repeat Fick calculations
   - continue ASA 325
   - plavix 75 daily
   - continue heparin gtt for IABP
   - continue simvastatin 80
   .
   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis on prelim echo post intervention.
   Support cardiac outpt as above.  LVEDP 25 in lab and pulm edema on CXR,
   but patient will require frequent boluses over thecourse of the day.
   - hold on ACE in setting of ARF
   - afterload reduce with IABP
   - consider milrinone if SVR goes up and peripherally clamps down.  Hold
   for now.
   - Goal I/o positive 1-2 liters with boluses as needed
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 80s for now.  Hold BB
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure/Aspiration: Likely due to aspiration in Cath
   lab. Hypoxia likely due to edema, consolidation, and underlying COPD.
   - Wean FiO2 to   nontoxic levels as tolerated
   - frequent suctioning
   - MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
   .
   # Aspiration pneumonitis: witnessed aspiration in cath lab and now
   intubated primarily for airway protection.  Although usually a
   chemically mediated process, will treat with abx since large volume
   aspiration and resp failure.
   - pan culture
   - taper down abx if able
   - treat resp failure as above.
   -  vanco/zosyn
   .
   # metabolic acidosis: Previous AG up to 15 likely from lactate. Delta
   delta suggests nongap acidosis likely due to renal failure.
   - Improvement with dynamics should improve renal failure and lactate
   - trend ABGs daily
   .
   # ARF: baseline Cr 1.3
 stable for last 24 hours at mid 2s.  FeUrea
   25% suggests prerenal.  regardless, suspect poor renal perfusion and
   ATN.
   - monitor daily lytes and renally dose meds
   - monitor for contrast nephropathy in 2-3d

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Condition Summary:**

The patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and hypertension. He was admitted with a STEMI in the perioperative period and now has cardiogenic shock. He underwent catheterization with three bare metal stents to the distal SVG to OM and has been treated with IABP, levophed, and other medications.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cardiogenic Shock:** The patient's cardiogenic shock is likely due to ischemia, and his hemodynamics have improved with IABP, but hypotension persists. There is a risk of further cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
2. **Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF):** The patient has ARF due to aspiration and hypoxia, which may worsen if not managed properly. There is a risk of further respiratory complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory failure.
3. **Metabolic Acidosis:** The patient has metabolic acidosis likely due to renal failure and lactate production. There is a risk of worsening acidosis if not managed properly, which can lead to further complications, including cardiac arrhythmias and kidney damage.
4. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI):** The patient has AKI likely due to prerenal azotemia and ATN. There is a risk of further kidney damage if not managed properly, which can lead to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
5. **Infection:** The patient has been treated with antibiotics for aspiration pneumonitis, and there is a risk of further infection, including VAP and sepsis.
6. **Pain Management:** The patient has chronic pain due to his medical conditions, and there is a risk of inadequate pain management, which can lead to further complications, including respiratory depression and cardiac arrhythmias.
7. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and GERD, and there is a risk of gastrointestinal complications, including bleeding, perforation, and sepsis.

**Plan:**

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue IABP and levophed to manage cardiogenic shock.
2. Wean FiO2 to non-toxic levels and continue suctioning to manage ARF.
3. Monitor ABGs daily to manage metabolic acidosis.
4. Monitor daily lytes and renally dose medications to manage AKI.
5. Continue antibiotics for aspiration pneumonitis and monitor for signs of infection.
6. Continue pain management with fentanyl and monitor for signs of inadequate pain management.
7. Monitor for gastrointestinal complications and manage accordingly.

**Recommendations:**

1. Repeat Fick calculations to monitor the patient's hemodynamics.
2. Continue ASA 325 and Plavix 75 daily to manage the patient's cardiac conditions.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medications accordingly.
4. Consider milrinone if the patient's SVR goes up and peripherally clamps down.
5. Hold on ACE in the setting of ARF.
6. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis with a H2 blocker instead of a PPI."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   now with cardiogenic shock s/p IABP.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: .Patient underwent cath with 3 BMS to
   distal SVG to OM CK peaked at 6000 and now downtrending. Given severity
   of MI cardiogenic shock is most likely due to ischemia. Hemodynamics
   improved with IABP, but hypotension persists. Doing better now on
   levophed, which may imply some septic physiology as well. Cardiac index
   down to 2.7 from 3.5 but may not be reliable given dramatic shifts in
   O2 saturation and hg.
   - Plan to trial IABP on 1:2 pump
   - D/c Dopamine and continue levophed for septic physiology and
   cardiogenic shock   with goal MAPs 60
   - Repeat Fick calculations
 hour after pump change
   - continue ASA 325
   - plavix 75 daily
   - continue heparin gtt for IABP
   - continue simvastatin 80
   .
   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis on prelim echo post intervention.
   Support cardiac outpt as above.  LVEDP 25 in lab and pulm edema on CXR,
   but patient will require frequent boluses over thecourse of the day.
   - hold on ACE in setting of ARF
   - afterload reduce with IABP
   - consider milrinone if SVR goes up and peripherally clamps down.  Hold
   for now.
   - Goal I/o positive 1-2 liters with boluses as needed
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 80s for now.  Hold BB
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure/Aspiration: Likely due to aspiration in Cath
   lab. Hypoxia likely due to edema, consolidation, and underlying COPD.
   - Wean FiO2 to   nontoxic levels as tolerated
   - frequent suctioning
   - MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
   .
   # Aspiration pneumonitis: witnessed aspiration in cath lab and now
   intubated primarily for airway protection.  Although usually a
   chemically mediated process, will treat with abx since large volume
   aspiration and resp failure.
   - pan culture
   - taper down abx if able
   - treat resp failure as above.
   -  vanco/zosyn
   .
   # metabolic acidosis: AG up to 15 likely from lactate. Delta delta
   suggests nongap acidosis likely due to renal failure.

 stable for last 24 hours at mid 2s.  FeUrea

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension (HTN), and ulcerative colitis. He was admitted with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the perioperative period and now presents with cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, and acute myocardial infarction.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac index has decreased to 2.7 from 3.5, and his mean arterial pressure (MAP) is 60 mmHg. He is receiving inotropes and has been placed on a levophed drip.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration in the cath lab, and is intubated for airway protection. He is receiving oxygen therapy and is being treated for suspected COPD.
3. Acute myocardial infarction: The patient has had a recent myocardial infarction, and his troponin levels are elevated.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a metabolic acidosis, likely due to lactate and renal failure.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, with a baseline creatinine of 1.3 and a current creatinine of 2.1. He is being treated with diuretics and is at risk for contrast nephropathy.
6. Ulcerative colitis: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and is being treated with asacol.
7. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is being treated with celexa.
8. GERD: The patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and is being treated with a H2 blocker.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock may worsen, leading to further decreases in cardiac output and blood pressure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further decreases in oxygen saturation and increases in respiratory acidosis.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to further increases in creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen, leading to further decreases in blood pH and increases in lactate levels.
5. Contrast nephropathy: The patient is at risk for contrast nephropathy, which may worsen his acute renal failure.
6. Sepsis: The patient's septic physiology may worsen, leading to further increases in inflammation and organ dysfunction.
7. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen, leading to further increases in lung water and decreases in lung compliance.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia, which may worsen his respiratory failure.

In terms of treatment, the patient is receiving inotropes, diuretics, and antibiotics, and is being monitored closely for any changes in his condition. Further treatment will depend on the patient's response to these therapies and the development of any new complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and
   Diagonal), PVD, HTN, admitted with STEMI in perioperative period and
   now with cardiogenic shock s/p IABP.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: .Patient underwent cath with 3 BMS to
   distal SVG to OM CK peaked at 6000 and now downtrending. Given severity
   of MI cardiogenic shock is most likely due to ischemia. Hemodynamics
   improved with IABP, but hypotension persists. Doing better now on
   levophed, which may imply some septic physiology as well. Cardiac index
   down to 2.7 from 3.5 but may not be reliable given dramatic shifts in
   O2 saturation and hg.
   - Plan to trial IABP on 1:2 pump
   - D/c Dopamine and continue levophed for septic physiology and
   cardiogenic shock   with goal MAPs 60
   - Repeat Fick calculations
 hour after pump change
   - continue ASA 325
   - plavix 75 daily
   - continue heparin gtt for IABP
   - continue simvastatin 80
   .
   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis on prelim echo post intervention.
   Support cardiac outpt as above.  LVEDP 25 in lab and pulm edema on CXR,
   but patient will require frequent boluses over thecourse of the day.
   - hold on ACE in setting of ARF
   - afterload reduce with IABP
   - consider milrinone if SVR goes up and peripherally clamps down.  Hold
   for now.
   - Goal I/o positive 1-2 liters with boluses as needed
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 80s for now.  Hold BB
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure/Aspiration: Likely due to aspiration in Cath
   lab. Hypoxia likely due to edema, consolidation, and underlying COPD.
   - Wean FiO2 to   nontoxic levels as tolerated
   - frequent suctioning
   - MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
   .
   # Aspiration pneumonitis: witnessed aspiration in cath lab and now
   intubated primarily for airway protection.  Although usually a
   chemically mediated process, will treat with abx since large volume
   aspiration and resp failure.
   - pan culture
   - taper down abx if able
   - treat resp failure as above.
   -  vanco/zosyn
   .
   # metabolic acidosis: AG up to 15 likely from lactate. Delta delta
   suggests nongap acidosis likely due to renal failure.
   - Improvement with dynamics should improve renal failure and lactate
   - trend ABGs daily
   .
   # ARF: baseline Cr 1.3
 stable for last 24 hours at mid 2s.  FeUrea
   25% suggests prerenal.  regardless, suspect poor renal perfusion and
   ATN.
   - monitor daily lytes and renally dose meds
   - monitor for contrast nephropathy in 2-3d
   .
   # s/p shoulder surgery - pain control w fentanyl bolus prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 66-inch-tall individual with a chief complaint of fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. They have been in the ICU for an unknown duration and have a history of coronary artery disease, ulcerative colitis, and coronary artery bypass graft. The patient has been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock, acute respiratory failure, and acute myocardial infarction (STEMI). They are currently receiving multiple medications, including vasopressors, sedatives, and pain management agents.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 101.1°F
* Heart rate: 83 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 75/30 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 15 mmHg, PAP (55 mmHg) / (23 mmHg), CO/CI (Fick) (7 L/min) / (3.7 L/min/m2)

The patient has undergone various tests, including EKG, cultures, and laboratory studies, which have revealed:

* EKG: normal sinus rhythm
* Cultures: negative to date
* Laboratory studies: WBC 8.2 K/uL, Hct 29.0%, Plt 230, Cr 2.1 mg/dL, TCO2 18 mmHg, Glucose 125 mg/dL, and others.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's condition is worsening, and cardiogenic shock is a life-threatening complication that can occur due to cardiac failure.
2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, and acute respiratory failure can lead to respiratory arrest and death.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a fever, and sepsis is a potential complication that can occur due to bacterial or fungal infections.
4. Myocardial infarction: The patient has an acute myocardial infarction, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and death.
5. Respiratory acidosis: The patient's partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) is not specified, but it is possible that respiratory acidosis can occur due to mechanical ventilation.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose level is 125 mg/dL, which is slightly low, and hypoglycemia can occur due to medication or other factors.
7. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 2.1 mg/dL, which is slightly elevated, and renal failure is a potential complication that can occur due to cardiogenic shock, sepsis, or other factors.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjusting treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and
   Diagonal), PVD, HTN, admitted with STEMI in perioperative period and
   now with cardiogenic shock s/p IABP.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: .Patient underwent cath with 3 BMS to
   distal SVG to OM CK peaked at 6000 and now downtrending. Given severity
   of MI cardiogenic shock is most likely due to ischemia. Hemodynamics
   improved with IABP, but hypotension persists. Doing better now on
   levophed, which may imply some septic physiology as well. Latest
   CO/CI/SVR @ 0330=7/3.7/700.
   - Plan to con
t  IABP on 1:1-1:2
   - D/c Dopamine and continue levophed, but con
t to wean, with goal MAPs

   - Repeat Fick calculations
   - continue ASA 325
   - plavix 75 daily
   - continue heparin gtt for IABP
   - continue simvastatin 80
   .
   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis on prelim echo post intervention.
   Support cardiac outpt as above.  LVEDP 25 in lab and pulm edema on CXR,
   but patient will require frequent boluses over thecourse of the day.
   - hold on ACE in setting of ARF
   - afterload reduce with IABP
   - consider milrinone if SVR goes up and peripherally clamps down.  Hold
   for now.
   - Goal I/o positive 1-2 liters with boluses as needed
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 80s for now.  Hold BB
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure/Aspiration: Likely due to aspiration in Cath
   lab. Hypoxia likely due to edema, consolidation, and underlying COPD.
   - Wean FiO2 to   nontoxic levels as tolerated
   - frequent suctioning
   - MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
   .
   # Aspiration pneumonitis: witnessed aspiration in cath lab and now
   intubated primarily for airway protection.  Although usually a
   chemically mediated process, will treat with abx since large volume
   aspiration and resp failure.
   - pan culture
   - taper down abx if able
   - treat resp failure as above.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 2859**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Critical care time 60 minutes.  Unstable hemodynamics and pressor
   dependent.  Spiked fever.  Some component of distributive shock on top
   of cardiogenic shock.  Needs to maintain IABP for now since when we
   wean, he becomes hypotensive. Aspiration pneumonia being presumptively
   treated with antibiotics.  Remains very tenuous.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass graft, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and ulcerative colitis. He was admitted with a STEMI in the perioperative period and now has cardiogenic shock and respiratory failure. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has a fever and is receiving antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia. He has metabolic acidosis and acute kidney injury (ARF) with a baseline creatinine of 1.3, which is stable for the last 24 hours. He has also had a recent shoulder surgery and is receiving pain management with fentanyl.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock is likely due to ischemia and may be exacerbated by septic physiology. He is receiving inotropic support with levophed and IABP, but his hypotension persists.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration pneumonia and underlying COPD. He is receiving mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy, but his oxygen saturation is only 96%.
3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's ARF is likely due to poor renal perfusion and ATN. He is receiving fluid management and will require close monitoring of his renal function.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely due to lactate and may be exacerbated by his ARF. He is receiving bicarbonate therapy and will require close monitoring of his acid-base status.
5. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's aspiration pneumonia is being presumptively treated with antibiotics, but he may require further treatment and management.
6. Sepsis: The patient's septic physiology may be contributing to his cardiogenic shock and metabolic acidosis. He will require close monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory values.
7. Intubation-related complications: The patient's intubation may be contributing to his respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. He will require close monitoring of his airway and respiratory status.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiogenic shock and respiratory failure closely and adjust his treatment plan as needed.
2. Consider adding additional antibiotics to the patient's regimen to cover for aspiration pneumonia.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's ARF and adjust his fluid management and medication regimen as needed.
4. Consider adding additional therapy to the patient's regimen to manage his metabolic acidosis, such as sodium bicarbonate or dialysis.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's septic physiology and adjust his treatment plan as needed.
6. Consider weaning the patient from the ventilator when his respiratory status improves.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's intubation-related complications and adjust his treatment plan as needed."

   75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and
   Diagonal), PVD, HTN, admitted with STEMI in perioperative period and
   now with cardiogenic shock s/p IABP.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: .Patient underwent cath with 3 BMS to
   distal SVG to OM CK peaked at 6000 and now downtrending. Given severity
   of MI cardiogenic shock is most likely due to ischemia. Hemodynamics
   improved with IABP, but hypotension persists. Doing better now on
   levophed, which may imply some septic physiology as well. Cardiac index
   down to 2.7 from 3.5 but may not be reliable given dramatic shifts in
   O2 saturation and hg.
   - Plan to trial IABP on 1:2 pump
   - D/c Dopamine and continue levophed for septic physiology and
   cardiogenic shock   with goal MAPs 60
   - Repeat Fick calculations
 hour after pump change
   - continue ASA 325
   - plavix 75 daily
   - continue heparin gtt for IABP
   - continue simvastatin 80
   .
   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis on prelim echo post intervention.
   Support cardiac outpt as above.  LVEDP 25 in lab and pulm edema on CXR,
   but patient will require frequent boluses over thecourse of the day.
   - hold on ACE in setting of ARF
   - afterload reduce with IABP
   - consider milrinone if SVR goes up and peripherally clamps down.  Hold
   for now.
   - Goal I/o positive 1-2 liters with boluses as needed
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 80s for now.  Hold BB
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure/Aspiration: Likely due to aspiration in Cath
   lab. Hypoxia likely due to edema, consolidation, and underlying COPD.
   - Wean FiO2 to   nontoxic levels as tolerated
   - frequent suctioning
   - MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
   .
   # Aspiration pneumonitis: witnessed aspiration in cath lab and now
   intubated primarily for airway protection.  Although usually a
   chemically mediated process, will treat with abx since large volume
   aspiration and resp failure.
   - pan culture
   - taper down abx if able
   - treat resp failure as above.
   -  vanco/zosyn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male admitted with STEMI in the perioperative period following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension (HTN), and ulcerative colitis.

The patient's current condition is complicated by cardiogenic shock, acute respiratory failure, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and aspiration pneumonitis. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. His hemodynamic parameters are unstable, with a cardiac index (CI) of 2.7, and he requires vasoactive medications to maintain blood pressure.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels are elevated, suggesting acute kidney injury (AKI). His lactate level is elevated, consistent with metabolic acidosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: Prolonged hypotension can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Prolonged mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy can increase the risk of ARDS.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): Prolonged hypotension and oliguria can worsen AKI, leading to chronic kidney disease.
4. Sepsis: The patient's septic physiology and ongoing antibiotic therapy increase the risk of sepsis.
5. Aspiration pneumonitis: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of aspiration pneumonitis.
6. Metabolic acidosis: Prolonged lactate elevation can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
7. Coronary artery occlusion: The patient's ongoing myocardial injury and ischemia increase the risk of coronary artery occlusion.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of ulcerative colitis and ongoing antibiotic therapy increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications.

To address these potential complications, the patient's care plan should include:

1. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and cardiac function.
2. Aggressive management of respiratory failure, including weaning from mechanical ventilation and optimizing oxygen therapy.
3. Intensive care of acute kidney injury, including fluid management and renal replacement therapy as needed.
4. Sepsis management, including prompt recognition and treatment of septic shock.

   75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and
   Diagonal), PVD, HTN, admitted with STEMI in perioperative period and
   now with cardiogenic shock s/p IABP.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: .Patient underwent cath with 3 BMS to
   distal SVG to OM CK peaked at 6000 and now downtrending. Given severity
   of MI cardiogenic shock is most likely due to ischemia. Hemodynamics
   improved with IABP, but hypotension persists. Doing better now on
   levophed, which may imply some septic physiology as well. Cardiac index
   down to 2.7 from 3.5 but may not be reliable given dramatic shifts in
   O2 saturation and hg.
   - Plan to trial IABP on 1:2 pump
   - D/c Dopamine and continue levophed for septic physiology and
   cardiogenic shock   with goal MAPs 60
   - Repeat Fick calculations
 hour after pump change
   - continue ASA 325
   - plavix 75 daily
   - continue heparin gtt for IABP
   - continue simvastatin 80
   .
   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis on prelim echo post intervention.
   Support cardiac outpt as above.  LVEDP 25 in lab and pulm edema on CXR,
   but patient will require frequent boluses over thecourse of the day.
   - hold on ACE in setting of ARF
   - afterload reduce with IABP
   - consider milrinone if SVR goes up and peripherally clamps down.  Hold
   for now.
   - Goal I/o positive 1-2 liters with boluses as needed
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 80s for now.  Hold BB
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure/Aspiration: Likely due to aspiration in Cath
   lab. Hypoxia likely due to edema, consolidation, and underlying COPD.
   - Wean FiO2 to   nontoxic levels as tolerated
   - frequent suctioning
   - MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
   .
   # Aspiration pneumonitis: witnessed aspiration in cath lab and now
   intubated primarily for airway protection.  Although usually a
   chemically mediated process, will treat with abx since large volume
   aspiration and resp failure.
   - pan culture
   - taper down abx if able
   - treat resp failure as above.
   -  vanco/zosyn
   .
   # metabolic acidosis: AG up to 15 likely from lactate. Delta delta
   suggests nongap acidosis likely due to renal failure.
   - Improvement with dynamics should improve renal failure and lactate
   - trend ABGs daily
   .
   # ARF: baseline Cr 1.3
 stable for last 24 hours at mid 2s.  FeUrea
   25% suggests prerenal.  regardless, suspect poor renal perfusion and
   ATN.
   - monitor daily lytes and renally dose meds
   - monitor for contrast nephropathy in 2-3d
   .
   # s/p shoulder surgery - pain control w fentanyl bolus prn
   - f/u XR
   - Ortho recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Albumin: 2.7 g/dL
* LDH: 1102 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.3 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Aspirin 325 mg daily
* Plavix 75 mg daily
* Simvastatin 80 mg daily
* Heparin 950 units/hour
* Midazolam 3 mg/hour
* Dopamine 3 mcg/Kg/min
* Norepinephrine 0.21 mcg/Kg/min
* Fentanyl 125 mcg/hour
* Famotidine (Pepcid) 20 mg every 12 hours
* Vancomycin 1.5 g every 12 hours
* Piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) 3.375 g every 8 hours

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Trial of IABP on 1:2 pump
* Discontinuation of dopamine and continuation of levophed for septic physiology and cardiogenic shock
* Repeat Fick calculations hourly after pump change
* Continue ASA 325 and Plavix 75 daily
* Continue heparin gtt for IABP
* Continue simvastatin 80 daily
* Hold ACE in setting of ARF
* Reduce afterload with IABP
* Consider milrinone if SVR goes up and peripherally clamps down
* Goal I/O positive 1-2 liters with boluses as needed
* Wean FiO2 to nontoxic levels as tolerated
* Frequent suctioning
* MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
* Taper down antibiotics if able
* Treat respiratory failure as above
* Monitor daily lytes and renally dose meds
* Monitor for contrast nephropathy in 2-3 days

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: the patient's cardiogenic shock may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further hemodynamic instability and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.
* Respiratory failure: the patient's respiratory failure may progress if not adequately treated, leading to further hypoxia and potential respiratory arrest.
* Acute kidney injury (AKI): the patient's AKI may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and potential need for dialysis.
* Sepsis: the patient's septic physiology may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further hemodynamic instability and potentially life-threatening organ dysfunction.
* Contrast nephropathy: the patient's use of contrast media may increase his risk of contrast nephropathy, leading to further AKI and potential need for dialysis.
* Pneumonia: the patient's aspiration pneumonitis may progress if not properly treated, leading to further respiratory failure and potential pneumonia.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: the patient's use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents may increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, leading to further complications and potential mortality.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medication regimen to prevent or promptly address these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   .
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: .Patient underwent cath with 3 BMS to
   distal SVG to OM CK peaked at 6000 and now downtrending. Given severity
   of MI cardiogenic shock is most likely due to ischemia. Hemodynamics
   improved with IABP, but hypotension persists. Doing better now on
   levophed, which may imply some septic physiology as well. Cardiac index
   down to 2.7 from 3.5 but may not be reliable given dramatic shifts in
   O2 saturation and hg.
   - Plan to trial IABP on 1:2 pump
   - D/c Dopamine and continue levophed for septic physiology and
   cardiogenic shock   with goal MAPs 60
   - Repeat Fick calculations

   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis on prelim echo post intervention.
   Support cardiac outpt as above.  LVEDP 25 in lab and pulm edema on CXR,
   but patient will require frequent boluses over thecourse of the day.
   - hold on ACE in setting of ARF
   - afterload reduce with IABP

   - Wean FiO2 to   nontoxic levels as tolerated
   - frequent suctioning
   - MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
   .
   # Aspiration pneumonitis: witnessed aspiration in cath lab and now
   intubated primarily for airway protection.  Although usually a
   chemically mediated process, will treat with abx since large volume
   aspiration and resp failure.
   - pan culture
   - taper down abx if able
   - treat resp failure as above.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass graft, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and ulcerative colitis. He was admitted with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the perioperative period and is currently experiencing cardiogenic shock, acute respiratory failure, and acute myocardial infarction.

The patient's condition is complex and requires careful management. The following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock is likely due to ischemia, and the plan is to trial IABP on 1:2 pump and continue levophed for septic physiology and cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which is likely due to aspiration in the cath lab and underlying COPD. The plan is to wean FiO2 to non-toxic levels as tolerated, frequent suctioning, and MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, likely due to lactate, and the plan is to trend ABGs daily and improve renal failure and lactate with hemodynamic improvement.
4. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient has ARF, likely due to poor renal perfusion and ATN. The plan is to monitor daily lytes and renally dose meds, monitor for contrast nephropathy in 2-3 days, and consider hemodynamic support.
5. Sepsis: The patient has septic physiology, which is likely due to the cardiogenic shock and respiratory failure. The plan is to continue levophed and consider antibiotics.
6. Pulmonary edema: The patient has pulmonary edema, which is likely due to cardiogenic shock and acute respiratory failure. The plan is to support cardiac output and consider diuresis.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. The plan is to continue asacol and monitor for signs of bleeding.
8. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is taking celexa.
9. Hypoxia: The patient has hypoxia, likely due to aspiration and underlying COPD. The plan is to wean FiO2 to non-toxic levels as tolerated and consider oxygen therapy.
10. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is likely due to sepsis and ARF. The plan is to monitor platelet counts and consider platelet transfusions.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his complex medical conditions to prevent potential complications and improve his outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and
   Diagonal), PVD, HTN, admitted with STEMI in perioperative period and
   now with cardiogenic shock s/p IABP.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: .Patient underwent cath with 3 BMS to
   distal SVG to OM CK peaked at 6000 indicating a massive amount of
   ischemia. Given severity of MI cardiogenic shock is most likely due to
   ischemia. Hemodynamics improved with IABP, but hypotension persists.
   Levophed downtitrated over last 24 hrs. Latest CO/CI/SVR =5.8/3.1/1012
   (CI down from 4.2, SVR up from 843). TTE on day of admission with EF
   that was not very suppressed.
   - Plan to con
t  IABP on 1:1
   - Continue dopamine and d/c levophed for enhanced cardiogenc shock
   pressor treatment.
   - Repeat Fick calculations with change in pressors
   - continue ASA 325
   - [**Year (4 digits) 1167**] 75 daily
   - continue heparin gtt for IABP
   - continue simvastatin 80
   - Repeat TTE today to assess for change in EF. I predict EF will be
   markedly reduced from TTE on admission.
   .
   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis on prelim echo post intervention.
   Support cardiac outpt as above.  LVEDP 25 in lab and pulm edema on CXR.
   Now that HD improved, patient will likely benefit from continued
   afterolad reduction with diuretics given fluid overload on exam
   - Lasix 20 mg IV x1. Goal I/O
 500 cc if BP will allow
   - afterload reduce with IABP
   - consider milrinone if SVR goes up and peripherally clamps down.  Hold
   for now.
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 80s for now.  Hold BB
   .
   # Anemia/thrombocytopenia: Patient did not have appropriate bump to
   PRBC transfusion yesterday. Platelets continue to downtrend. I suspect
   hemolysis from balloon pump. Guaiac positive NG output worrisome for
   UGIB. Plan for goal Hct greater than 26. TTP unlikely as this is
   relatively new. HIT unlikely as there is a another good explanation for
   thromobocytopenia (4T score
 meets criteria for > 50% plt fall, but
   plt drop in less than 5 days, no clots and pt has other good reason for
   low plts)
   - Add on hemolysis labs
   - Start IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider HIT ab if [**Hospital1 6350**].
   - Will continue heparin gtt/[**Hospital1 1167**] for now. If Hct [**Last Name (LF) 6350**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   need to address utility of continuing heparin in setting of bleed vs
   taking IABP out
   .
   # Vomiting: [**Month (only) 11**] be due to UGIB or more likely ileus secondary to
   sedating meds.
   - KUB today to asses for obstruction
   - Start PPI as above
   - Limit sedating meds as much as possible
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure/Aspiration: Likely due to aspiration in Cath
   lab. Although this is usually chemically mediated, abx were started
   given dramatically low BPs. Hypoxia likely due to edema, consolidation,
   and underlying COPD. FiO2 increased last night back to 60 for hypoxia.
   Plan to reduce FiO2 today as anticipate diuresis will improve
   oxygenation.
   - Wean FiO2 to   nontoxic levels as tolerated pending diuresis
   - frequent suctioning
   - MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for now. Will uptitrate vanco to 1 g daily given
   improved renal function.
   - F/u cx data and CIS
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: AG trended down from 15 to 9 today. Non gap
   acidosis likely due to renal failure. Bicarb improved from 14 to 17 as
   renal function improved.  Delta delta suggests nongap acidosis likely
   due to renal failure initially.  Appears to have respiratory
   compensation with low CO2.
   - Improvement with dynamics should improve renal failure
   - trend ABGs daily
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and
   Diagonal), PVD, HTN, admitted with STEMI in perioperative period and
   now with cardiogenic shock s/p IABP.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: .Patient underwent cath with 3 BMS to
   distal SVG to OM CK peaked at 6000 indicating a massive amount of
   ischemia. Given severity of MI cardiogenic shock is most likely due to
   ischemia. Hemodynamics improved with IABP, but hypotension persists.
   Levophed downtitrated over last 24 hrs. Latest CO/CI/SVR =5.8/3.1/1012
   (CI down from 4.2, SVR up from 843). TTE on day of admission with EF
   that was not very suppressed.
   - Plan to con
t  IABP on 1:1
   - Continue dopamine and d/c levophed for enhanced cardiogenc shock
   pressor treatment.
   - Repeat Fick calculations with change in pressors
   - continue ASA 325
   - [**Year (4 digits) 1167**] 75 daily
   - continue heparin gtt for IABP
   - continue simvastatin 80
   - Repeat TTE today to assess for change in EF. I predict EF will be
   markedly reduced from TTE on admission.
   .
   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis on prelim echo post intervention.
   Support cardiac outpt as above.  LVEDP 25 in lab and pulm edema on CXR.
   Now that HD improved, patient will likely benefit from continued
   afterolad reduction with diuretics given fluid overload on exam
   - Lasix 20 mg IV x1. Goal I/O
 500 cc if BP will allow
   - afterload reduce with IABP
   - consider milrinone if SVR goes up and peripherally clamps down.  Hold
   for now.
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 80s for now.  Hold BB
   .
   # Anemia/thrombocytopenia: Patient did not have appropriate bump to
   PRBC transfusion yesterday. Platelets continue to downtrend. I suspect
   hemolysis from balloon pump. Guaiac positive NG output worrisome for
   UGIB. Plan for goal Hct greater than 26. TTP unlikely as this is
   relatively new. HIT unlikely as there is a another good explanation for
   thromobocytopenia (4T score
 meets criteria for > 50% plt fall, but
   plt drop in less than 5 days, no clots and pt has other good reason for
   low plts)
   - Add on hemolysis labs
   - Start IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider HIT ab if [**Hospital1 6350**].
   - Will continue heparin gtt/[**Hospital1 1167**] for now. If Hct [**Last Name (LF) 6350**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   need to address utility of continuing heparin in setting of bleed vs
   taking IABP out
   .
   # Vomiting: [**Month (only) 11**] be due to UGIB or more likely ileus secondary to
   sedating meds.
   - KUB today to asses for obstruction
   - Start PPI as above
   - Limit sedating meds as much as possible
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure/Aspiration: Likely due to aspiration in Cath
   lab. Although this is usually chemically mediated, abx were started
   given dramatically low BPs. Hypoxia likely due to edema, consolidation,
   and underlying COPD. FiO2 increased last night back to 60 for hypoxia.
   Plan to reduce FiO2 today as anticipate diuresis will improve
   oxygenation.
   - Wean FiO2 to   nontoxic levels as tolerated pending diuresis
   - frequent suctioning
   - MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for now. Will uptitrate vanco to 1 g daily given
   improved renal function.
   - F/u cx data and CIS
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: AG trended down from 15 to 9 today. Non gap
   acidosis likely due to renal failure. Bicarb improved from 14 to 17 as
   renal function improved.  Delta delta suggests nongap acidosis likely
   due to renal failure initially.  Appears to have respiratory
   compensation with low CO2.
   - Improvement with dynamics should improve renal failure
   - trend ABGs daily
   .
   # ARF: Baseline Cr 1.3
 and now improved markedly to 1.4.   FeUrea 25%
   suggests prerenal.  regardless, suspect poor renal perfusion and ATN.
   Contrast nephropathy unlikely as 3 days post cath renal function is
   improving.
   - monitor daily lytes and renally dose meds

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition and potential medical complications as follows:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and is currently in cardiogenic shock following a recent CABG surgery.
* He has a STEMI and has undergone catheterization with three BMS placed to the distal SVG to OM.
* He is currently intubated and sedated, with a poor response to verbal stimuli.
* His hemodynamics are unstable, with a low cardiac output and a high systemic vascular resistance.
* He has a significant anemia, thrombocytopenia, and metabolic acidosis.
* He has a history of ulcerative colitis and depression, and is currently receiving treatment for these conditions.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cardiogenic Shock:** The patient's cardiogenic shock is likely due to ischemia, and his hemodynamics are unstable. He requires continued support with IABP and dopamine, and his condition should be closely monitored.
2. **Hemolysis:** The patient's hemolysis is suspected to be caused by the IABP, and he requires further monitoring and treatment to prevent further hemolysis.
3. **Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB):** The patient's guaiac-positive NG output is worrisome for UGIB, and he requires further evaluation and treatment to prevent further bleeding.
4. **Renal Failure:** The patient's renal function is impaired, and he requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent further decline in renal function.
5. **Metabolic Acidosis:** The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely due to renal failure, and he requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent further acidosis.
6. **Pneumonia:** The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and aspiration in the cath lab make pneumonia a potential complication.
7. **Pulmonary Edema:** The patient's pulmonary edema is likely due to cardiogenic shock, and he requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent further edema.
8. **Depression:** The patient's depression is a potential complication, and he requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent further decline in mental health.
9. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient's history of ulcerative colitis and current use of corticosteroids make gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation, a potential risk.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and
   Diagonal), PVD, HTN, admitted with STEMI in perioperative period and
   now with cardiogenic shock s/p IABP.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: .Patient underwent cath with 3 BMS to
   distal SVG to OM CK peaked at 6000 and now downtrending. Given severity
   of MI cardiogenic shock is most likely due to ischemia. Hemodynamics
   improved with IABP, but hypotension persists. Doing better now on
   levophed, which may imply some septic physiology as well. Latest
   CO/CI/SVR @ 0330=7/3.7/700.
   - Plan to con
t  IABP on 1:1-1:2
   - D/c Dopamine and continue levophed, but con
t to wean, with goal MAPs
   60
   - Repeat Fick calculations
   - continue ASA 325
   - [**Year (4 digits) 1167**] 75 daily
   - continue heparin gtt for IABP
   - continue simvastatin 80
   .
   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis on prelim echo post intervention.
   Support cardiac outpt as above.  LVEDP 25 in lab and pulm edema on CXR,
   but patient will require frequent boluses over thecourse of the day.
   - hold on ACE in setting of ARF
   - afterload reduce with IABP
   - consider milrinone if SVR goes up and peripherally clamps down.  Hold
   for now.
   - Goal I/o positive 1-2 liters with boluses as needed
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 80s for now.  Hold BB
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure/Aspiration: Likely due to aspiration in Cath
   lab. Hypoxia likely due to edema, consolidation, and underlying COPD.
   - Wean FiO2 to   nontoxic levels as tolerated
   - frequent suctioning
   - MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
   .
   # Aspiration pneumonitis: witnessed aspiration in cath lab and now
   intubated primarily for airway protection.  Although usually a
   chemically mediated process, will treat with abx since large volume
   aspiration and resp failure.
   - pan culture
   - taper down abx if able
   - treat resp failure as above.
   -  vanco/zosyn
   .
   # metabolic acidosis: Previous AG up to 15 likely from lactate. Delta
   delta suggests nongap acidosis likely due to renal failure.
   - Improvement with dynamics should improve renal failure and lactate
   - trend ABGs daily
   .
   # ARF: baseline Cr 1.3
 stable for last 24 hours at mid 2s.  FeUrea
   25% suggests prerenal.  regardless, suspect poor renal perfusion and
   ATN.
   - monitor daily lytes and renally dose meds
   - monitor for contrast nephropathy in 2-3d

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male admitted with STEMI in the perioperative period following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He developed cardiogenic shock and was treated with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and vasopressors.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamics: The patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) is 40s, and he is being supported with norepinephrine and levophed. His cardiac output (CO) and cardiac index (CI) are 5.8 L/min and 3.1 L/min/m2, respectively.
* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and ventilated on a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. His partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) is 193 mmHg, and his partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) is 30 mmHg.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is 8.2 K/uL, and his hemoglobin (Hb) is 9.9 g/dL. His creatinine (Cr) is 2.1 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 17 mg/dL. His lactate level is 2.1 mmol/L.
* Medications: The patient is receiving a variety of medications, including vasopressors, antibiotics, and anticoagulants.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiogenic shock may persist or worsen, leading to further hemodynamic instability. He may also develop arrhythmias or heart block.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, leading to further hypoxemia or hypercapnia.
* Renal complications: The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) may progress, leading to further elevations in his Cr and BUN levels.
* Metabolic complications: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen, leading to further elevations in his lactate level.
* Infectious complications: The patient's aspiration pneumonitis may progress, leading to further respiratory failure or sepsis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of their condition:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of none. They have a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, and ulcerative colitis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 64 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 119/46 mmHg. Their oxygen saturation is 97% on 60% FiO2. They are intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.2 K/μL, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 121 K/μL. Their electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated lactate level of 2.1 mmol/L.

The patient's medical complications include shock, cardiac failure, and acute respiratory failure. They have a history of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease, and are currently receiving treatment for cardiac instability.

The patient's pain control is managed with fentanyl and midazolam infusions. They are also receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin sodium.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of myocardial infarction and cardiac instability, they are at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate level and presence of yeast in their sputum culture may indicate the presence of sepsis, which could worsen their cardiac and respiratory status.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy with heparin sodium may increase their risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding or hematoma formation.
5. Organ failure: The patient's cardiac and respiratory failure may lead to organ failure, including renal or hepatic failure.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications and optimize their outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, and myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T, CK-MB, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indicating myocardial injury. The patient's coagulation profile shows elevated levels of fibrinogen and D-dimer, suggesting a hypercoagulable state. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's imaging studies show evidence of cardiac injury, including a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45-50% and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The patient's echocardiogram shows mild LV inferolateral hypokinesis.

The patient's clinical status is stable, with no significant changes in his vital signs or laboratory results over the past 24 hours. The patient remains intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, and his respiratory support is adjusted as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and cardiac arrhythmias can occur, potentially leading to cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, but respiratory failure can still occur, potentially leading to hypoxia and hypercapnia.
3. Sepsis: The patient's hypercoagulable state and elevated levels of inflammatory markers suggest a risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) suggest a risk of renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) suggest a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and organ dysfunction.
6. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's hypercoagulable state and elevated levels of D-dimer suggest a risk of pulmonary embolism, which can lead to hypoxia and respiratory failure.
7. Infection: The patient's elevated levels of inflammatory markers and white blood cell count suggest a risk of infection, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.

In conclusion, the patient's clinical status is stable, but he remains at risk for various medical complications. Close monitoring and aggressive management of his condition are necessary to prevent these complications and improve his outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-inch tall, 86.9 kg male who has been admitted to the ICU for 4 days. He has a history of coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass graft, and ulcerative colitis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His FiO2 has been decreased from 0.6 to 0.5, and his PEEP has been set to 5 cmH2O.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and his left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF = 45-50%).
* Renal status: The patient's creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, and his urine output is 2,325 mL over the past 24 hours.
* Hematological status: The patient has anemia (Hct = 29.9%) and thrombocytopenia (Platelet count = 111 K/uL).
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and is receiving IV PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
* Infectious disease status: The patient is receiving antibiotics for suspected sepsis.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC = 7.5, Hct = 29.9%, Platelet count = 111 K/uL
* Blood chemistry: Creatinine = 1.4 mg/dL, Glucose = 122 mg/dL, Albumin = 2.7 g/dL, LDH = 840 IU/L
* Coagulation studies: PT = 13.8, PTT = 57.8, INR = 1.2

The patient's medical complications are as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
* Cardiogenic shock: The patient has mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and mildly depressed left ventricular systolic function.
* Myocardial infarction: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and coronary artery bypass graft.
* Sepsis: The patient is receiving antibiotics for suspected sepsis.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and is receiving IV PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's potential medical complications are as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient may develop respiratory failure due to his intubation and mechanical ventilation.
* Cardiogenic shock: The patient may develop cardiogenic shock due to his mildly depressed left ventricular systolic function.
* Myocardial infarction: The patient may develop myocardial infarction due to his history of coronary artery disease and coronary artery bypass graft.
* Sepsis: The patient may develop sepsis due to his suspected sepsis and receipt of antibiotics.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient may develop gastrointestinal bleeding due to his history of ulcerative colitis and receipt of IV PPI.

The patient's plan of care is as follows:

* Continue mechanical ventilation and FiO2 adjustment as needed.
* Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust medications as needed.
* Monitor the patient's renal status and adjust medications as needed.
* Monitor the patient's hematological status and adjust medications as needed.
* Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust medications as needed.
* Continue antibiotics for suspected sepsis.
* Continue IV PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
* Monitor the patient's laboratory results and adjust medications as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male who was admitted with STEMI in the perioperative period and now presents with cardiogenic shock. The patient has a history of CAD, PVD, HTN, and CABG.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock is likely due to ischemia, and hemodynamics are improving with IABP. The patient remains on dopamine.
* STEMI: The patient has a history of STEMI, and the current ECG shows a mildly depressed LVEF with EF 45-50%.
* Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which may be related to hemolysis from the balloon pump. Haptoglobin levels are normal, and fibrinogen levels are elevated.
* Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure, which is likely due to aspiration in the cath lab and underlying COPD. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and diuresis.
* Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is suspected to be due to poor renal perfusion and ATN. The patient's creatinine level is 1.6, which is an increase from the baseline level of 1.3.
* Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis has resolved.
* Ileus: The patient has ileus, which is likely due to sedating medications. The patient's NG output is positive, and he is receiving IV PPI.
* Hypoxia: The patient has hypoxia, which is likely due to edema, consolidation, and underlying COPD.
* Fever: The patient has a fever, which is likely due to pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiogenic shock and STEMI increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and underlying COPD increase the risk of respiratory failure.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure and ATN increase the risk of worsening renal function.
* Hemorrhage: The patient's thrombocytopenia and anemia increase the risk of hemorrhage.
* Infection: The patient's fever and pneumonia increase the risk of infection.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ileus and NG output increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuation of IABP and dopamine
* Diuresis to improve oxygenation
* Weaning of FiO2 to non-toxic levels as tolerated
* Frequent suctioning
* MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD
* Continue vancomycin and Zosyn for now
* Recheck urine lytes and monitor daily lytes and renally dose meds
* Monitor for signs of infection and hemorrhage
* Continue pain management with fentanyl
* Continue bowel regimen with senna/colace
* Continue prophylaxis for DVT and pain management with fentanyl."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and admitted with STEMI in the perioperative period and now with cardiogenic shock. He underwent catheterization with 3 bare metal stents to the distal SVG to OM, and cardiogenic shock is most likely due to ischemia. He was treated with IABP, dopamine, and diuretics. His current medications include ASA 325, Plavix 75 daily, and simvastatin 80.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.3°C
* Heart rate: 69 bpm
* Blood pressure: 136/48 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 99%
* CVP: 14 mmHg
* PAP: 35/25 mmHg
* CO/CI (Fick): 7 L/min/3.8 L/min/m2

Lab results:

* WBC: 7.5
* Hct: 29.9%
* Plt: 111
* Cr: 1.6
* TCO2: 19
* Glucose: 114
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 13.8/57.8/1.2, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 3175/148/15.28, ALT/AST: 20/71, Alk Phos/T Bili: 71/1.0, Differential-Neuts: 66.1%, Lymph: 20.5%, Mono: 6.6%, Eos: 5.9%, Fibrinogen: 625 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 2.1 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.7 g/dL, LDH: 840 IU/L, Ca++: 7.5 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL, PO4: 2.4 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock is likely due to ischemia, and his treatment plan includes IABP, dopamine, and diuretics. He will continue to receive ASA 325, Plavix 75 daily, and simvastatin 80.
2. Anemia/thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia is trending up, but his platelet count is still decreasing, likely due to hemolysis from the balloon pump. His hemolysis labs are unremarkable, and TTP and HIT are unlikely.
3. Vomiting: The patient's vomiting is likely due to ileus secondary to sedating medications, and he will continue to receive PPI and limit sedating medications as much as possible.
4. Hypoxic resp failure/aspiration: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to aspiration in the cath lab, edema, consolidation, and underlying COPD. He will continue to receive FiO2 and frequent suctioning.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis has resolved.
6. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is likely due to poor renal perfusion and ATN. He will continue to receive diuretics and monitor his daily lytes and renally dosed medications.
7. Ulcerative colitis: The patient's ulcerative colitis is being managed with Asacol 1600, and he will discuss whether Asacol can be given PR since it cannot be crushed.
8. Depression: The patient is receiving Celexa for depression.
9. Hx of GERD: The patient has a history of GERD and will use H2 blockers instead of PPI since Plavix.
10. Pain management: The patient is receiving fentanyl for pain control.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue IABP on 1:1
* Continue dopamine for enhanced cardiogenic shock pressor treatment
* Repeat Fick calculations with change in pressors
* Continue ASA 325
* Continue Plavix 75 daily
* Continue simvastatin 80
* Continue heparin gtt for IABP
* Continue diuretics
* Monitor daily lytes and renally dosed medications
* Trend Hct
* Continue IV PPI
* Limit sedating medications as much as possible
* Wean FiO2 to non-toxic levels as tolerated pending diuresis
* Frequent suctioning
* MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
* Continue Vanco/Zosyn for now
* Uptitrate Vanco to 1 g daily given improved renal function

   75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and
   Diagonal), PVD, HTN, admitted with STEMI in perioperative period and
   now with cardiogenic shock s/p IABP.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: .Patient underwent cath with 3 BMS to
   distal SVG to OM CK peaked at 6000 indicating a massive amount of
   ischemia. Cardiogenic shock is most likely due to ischemia.
   Hemodynamics improved with IABP. Levophed has been weaned off and pt
   now only on dopamine. Latest CO/CI/SVR = 7/3.8/801( 5.3/2.9/632).  TTE
   yesterday demonstrated mildly depressed LVEF with EF 45-50%.
   - Plan to con
t  IABP on 1:1
   - Continue dopamine for enhanced cardiogenc shock pressor treatment.
   - Repeat Fick calculations with change in pressors
   - continue ASA 325
   - plavix 75 daily
   - continue heparin gtt for IABP
   - continue simvastatin 80
    .
   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis persisted on ECHO yesterdayCont
   afterload reduction with diuretics.
   - Lasix 20 mg IV x1. Goal I/O
 500 cc if BP will allow
   - afterload reduce with IABP
   - consider milrinone if SVR goes up and peripherally clamps down.  Hold
   for now.
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 60-70
s for now.  Hold BB
   .
   # Anemia/thrombocytopenia: Hct trending up though plts cont to trend
   down likely [**1-1**] hemolysis from balloon pump. Hemolysis labs
   unremarkable. TTP unlikely as this is relatively new. HIT unlikely as
   there is a another good explanation for thromobocytopenia (4T score
   meets criteria for > 50% plt fall, but plt drop in less than 5 days, no
   clots and pt has other good reason for low plts)
   - Cont IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Will continue heparin gtt/plavix for now. If Hct [**Last Name (LF) 6350**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   need to address utility of continuing heparin in setting of bleed vs
   taking IABP out
   .
   # Vomiting: [**Month (only) 11**] be due to UGIB or more likely ileus secondary to
   sedating meds.
   - No e/o obstruction or ileus on KUB
   - PPI as above
   - Limit sedating meds as much as possible
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure/Aspiration: Likely due to aspiration in Cath
   lab. Although this is usually chemically mediated, abx were started
   given dramatically low BPs. Hypoxia likely due to edema, consolidation,
   and underlying COPD. FiO2 increased last night back to 60 for hypoxia.
   Hoping that cont diuresis will improve oxygenation.
   - Wean FiO2 to   nontoxic levels as tolerated pending diuresis
   - frequent suctioning
   - MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for now. Will uptitrate vanco to 1 g daily given
   improved renal function.
   - F/u cx data and CIS
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Improving non gap acidosis which was likely due
   to renal failure.
   - Improvement with dynamics should improve renal failure
   - trend ABGs daily
   .
   # ARF: Baseline Cr 1.3
 and now improved markedly to 1.6.   FeUrea 25%
   suggests prerenal.  Suspect poor renal perfusion and ATN.
   - monitor daily lytes and renally dose meds
   .
   # s/p shoulder surgery - pain control w fentanyl bolus prn
   - f/u XR
   - Ortho recs
   .
   # Ulcerative colitis: Discuss whether asacol can be given PR since
   can
t be crushed.  continue asacol 1600 [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # depression: celexa
   .
   # hx of GERD: use H2 blocker instead of PPI since plavix
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and admitted with STEMI in the perioperative period. He underwent cardiac catheterization with three bare-metal stents to the distal SVG to OM, and cardiogenic shock is suspected due to ischemia. The patient is currently on dopamine for enhanced cardiogenic shock treatment and has an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) in place.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His respiratory status is concerning, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and an increased FiO2 of 60%. He is intubated and sedated, but responds to sternal rub.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are being monitored. His kidney function is improving, with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL. He has a mild metabolic acidosis, which is improving.

The patient's medical conditions include cardiogenic shock, STEMI, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypoxic respiratory failure, and metabolic acidosis. He is at risk for complications such as bleeding, aspiration, and renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock is likely due to ischemia, and the IABP is helping to improve hemodynamics. However, there is a risk of further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
2. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to his thrombocytopenia and anemia. He is receiving heparin and platelet transfusions, but there is a risk of bleeding complications.
3. Aspiration: The patient is at risk for aspiration due to his intubation and sedation. He is receiving suctioning and MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is improving, but he is at risk for further renal failure due to his cardiogenic shock and anemia.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is improving, but there is a risk of further acidosis due to his cardiogenic shock and anemia.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his intubation and sedation. He is receiving antibiotics, but there is a risk of further infection.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory failure due to his hypoxic respiratory failure and anemia.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions and complications. He requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve his overall condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Hypoxic Resp Failure/Aspiration: Likely due to aspiration in Cath
   lab. Hypoxia likely due to edema, consolidation, and underlying COPD.
   FiO2 increased last night back to 60 for hypoxia. Hoping that cont
   diuresis will improve oxygenation.
   - Recheck a gas this morning
   - Wean FiO2 to   nontoxic levels as tolerated pending diuresis
   - frequent suctioning

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He was admitted with a STEMI in the perioperative period and now has cardiogenic shock secondary to ischemia. He is being treated with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and dopamine.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, and the physician suspects that it may be related to hemolysis from the IABP. Further evaluation, including a 4T score and Heparin-dependent antibody testing, is recommended.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure, which may be due to aspiration in the cath lab, edema, consolidation, and underlying COPD. The physician plans to wean the FiO2 to non-toxic levels as tolerated pending diuresis.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock is likely due to ischemia, and the physician plans to continue treatment with dopamine and IABP.
4. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is increasing, and the physician suspects that it may be due to poor renal perfusion and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Further evaluation, including urine electrolyte testing, is recommended.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and is currently holding Asacol due to the risk of bleeding. The physician plans to discuss the possibility of giving PR Asacol with the outpatient gastroenterologist.
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis has resolved, but the physician will continue to monitor his electrolyte levels and renal function.
7. Depression: The patient is being treated with Celexa for depression, and the physician plans to continue this treatment.
8. Hypoxia: The patient has hypoxia, which may be due to his underlying COPD and respiratory failure. The physician plans to continue oxygen therapy and wean the FiO2 to non-toxic levels as tolerated.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for complications, including bleeding, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest. Close monitoring and aggressive management of these potential complications are necessary to improve the patient's outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Goal fluid status -500 mL
   - Thrombocytopenia: will stop Vanc/Zosyn (Vanc could be contributing)
   and stop famotidine/pantoprazole. Most likely thrombocytopenia related
   to IABP.Did send off HIT Ab today.
   - ? Aspiration PNA: started Levaquin to replace Vanc/Zosyn
   -Holding Asacol per pharmacy (cannot crush PO and PR is only
   local).Emailed primary gastroenterologist re: PR Asacol.
   - Starting TF slowly
   - Afternoon gas showed improved O2 to 165 so FiO2 [**Month (only) 202**] to 50%-->repeat
   ABG O2 98 so FiO2 weaned to 40%
   - I/Os at 1730 showed -740 fluid balance p midnight but +190 since 8AM,
   with hourly UOP as low as 15cc/hr. Will re-check at 11PM and consider
   bolus/lasix.
   - Per GI ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6405**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6406**]), OK to hold Asacol if no signs of UC. If
   develops signs of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] use low-dose prednisone.
   -O/N pressures remained labile. Small adjustements to dopamine
   corrects.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and was admitted with a STEMI in the perioperative period. He is currently in cardiogenic shock and is being treated with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and dopamine. His laboratory results show thrombocytopenia, anemia, and acute kidney injury (AKI). He also has a history of ulcerative colitis and is being treated with medications to manage his condition.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock is likely to continue, and he may require further treatment with medications and other interventions to stabilize his condition.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be related to the IABP, and he may require further treatment to manage this condition.
3. AKI: The patient's AKI may be related to his cardiogenic shock, and he may require further treatment to manage this condition.
4. Ulcerative colitis: The patient's ulcerative colitis may flare up due to his current condition, and he may require further treatment to manage this condition.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to his cardiogenic shock, and he may require further treatment to manage this condition.
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen due to his cardiogenic shock, and he may require further treatment to manage this condition.
7. Depression: The patient's depression may worsen due to his current condition, and he may require further treatment to manage this condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiogenic shock and adjust treatment as necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's thrombocytopenia and adjust treatment as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's AKI and adjust treatment as necessary.
4. Continue to manage the patient's ulcerative colitis with medications and other interventions as necessary.
5. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with oxygen therapy and other interventions as necessary.
6. Continue to manage the patient's metabolic acidosis with medications and other interventions as necessary.
7. Continue to manage the patient's depression with medications and other interventions as necessary.

   75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and
   Diagonal), PVD, HTN, admitted with STEMI in perioperative period and
   now with cardiogenic shock s/p IABP.
   .
   # Cardiogenic Shock/STEMI. Latest Co/CI/SVR=7.3/3.9/722. Remains very
   labile O/N but less highs/lows than yesterday. Likely a component of
   autonomic dysregulation.
   - Plan to cont IABP on 1:1
   - Continue dopamine for pressure support
   - Repeat Fick calculations with change in pressors
   - Continue ASA 325, Plavix 75, heparin gtt for IABP, simva 80.
   - Try to wean FiO2 again today.
   .
   # PUMP: Still volume up. Did not receive lasix yesterday [**1-1**]
   hypotension. Pt was negative 781 over last 24 hrs, but even since
   midnight.
   - 20 mg this AM. Goal I/O -500 cc if BP allows
   - Continue afterload reduction with IABP, consider ACE if Cre allows.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Mostly NSR with rate 50s-60s, sporadic PVCs. Hold BB.
   .
   # Anemia: PLT stabilized but Hct dropping. Will follow today and
   consider transfusion if continues to drop.
   - Continue to avoid drugs that may cause thrombocytopenia
   .
   # Vomiting: resolved
   .
   # Resp Failure/Aspiration:
   - Try to wean FiO2 again today to 40%
   - frequent suctioning
   - continue COPD meds
   - Continue levaquin instead of Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   # ARF. Cre improved O/N.
   - monitor daily lytes, renally dose meds
   .
   # s/p shoulder surgery
   - continue pain control with fentanyl bolus prn
   .
   # UC. per GI, d/c asacol for now.
   - guaiac stools to make sure UC is not flaring. if flares, LD
   prednisone.
   .
   # depression. celexa.
   # GERD. conitnue to avoue H2b or PPI for now due to thrombocytopenia.
   # FEN: Tolerating TFs.
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: Cardiogenic shock is most likely due to
   ischemia. Hemodynamics improving with IABP. Levophed has been weaned
   off and he remains on dopamine. Latest CO/CI/SVR = 7/3.8/801(
   5.3/2.9/632).  TTE yesterday demonstrated mildly depressed LVEF with EF
   45-50%.
   - Plan to con
t  IABP on 1:1
   - Continue dopamine for enhanced cardiogenc shock pressor treatment.
   - continue ASA 325
   - plavix 75 daily
   - continue heparin gtt for IABP
   - continue simvastatin 80
    .
   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis persisted on ECHO yesterday. Cont
   afterload reduction with diuresis.
   - Lasix 20 mg IV x1. Goal I/O
 500 cc if BP will allow
   - afterload reduce with IABP
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 60-70
s for now.  Hold BB
   .
   # Anemia/thrombocytopenia: Hct trending up though plts cont to trend
   down likely [**1-1**] hemolysis from balloon pump. Hemolysis labs
   unremarkable. HIT is certainly possible and 4T score is intermediate.
   - Send Heparin dependent Ab
   - Stop meds that could be contributing: PPI, Vanc
   - Will continue heparin gtt/plavix for now
   .
   # Vomiting: [**Month (only) 11**] be due to UGIB or more likely ileus secondary to
   sedating meds.
   - No e/o obstruction or ileus on KUB
   - Limit sedating meds as much as possible
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure/Aspiration: Likely due to aspiration in Cath
   lab. Hypoxia likely due to edema, consolidation, and underlying COPD.
   FiO2 increased last night back to 60 for hypoxia. Hoping that cont
   diuresis will improve oxygenation.
   - Recheck a gas this morning
   - Wean FiO2 to   nontoxic levels as tolerated pending diuresis
   - frequent suctioning
   - MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for now. Will uptitrate vanco to 1 g daily given
   improved renal function.
   - F/u cx data and CIS
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Resolved.
   .
   # ARF: Cr 1.6.-baseline around 1.3   Suspect poor renal perfusion and
   ATN.
   - recheck urine lytes
   - cont to monitor
   - monitor daily lytes and renally dose meds
   .
   # s/p shoulder surgery - pain control w fentanyl bolus prn
   - f/u XR
   - Ortho recs
   .
   # Ulcerative colitis: Holding asacol at this time since it cannot be
   crushed. Will discuss whether we should give PR asacol with outpatient
   gastroenterologist.
   .
   # depression: cont celexa
   .
   # hx of GERD: holding PPI and H2 blocker for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and ulcerative colitis (UC). He was admitted with a STEMI in the perioperative period and developed cardiogenic shock. He is currently on mechanical ventilation, inotropes, and vasopressors. His laboratory results show thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury (AKI), and anemia. He has a history of GERD and is currently holding PPI and H2 blocker due to thrombocytopenia.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock is likely due to ischemia, and his hemodynamics are improving with IABP. However, he is still at risk for further deterioration.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and he is at risk for bleeding. He is currently on heparin and plavix, which may be contributing to his thrombocytopenia.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and he is at risk for further kidney damage.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and he is at risk for further anemia.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and he is at risk for further respiratory failure.
6. Ulcerative colitis (UC) flare: The patient has a history of UC, and he is currently holding Asacol. He is at risk for a UC flare, which could lead to complications such as bleeding or perforation.
7. Depression: The patient is taking celexa, and he is at risk for depression.
8. GERD: The patient has a history of GERD, and he is currently holding PPI and H2 blocker due to thrombocytopenia. He is at risk for further GERD complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiogenic shock and adjust his treatment plan as needed.
2. Consider switching the patient to a different anticoagulant to reduce the risk of thrombocytopenia.
3. Monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust his treatment plan as needed.
4. Consider transfusing the patient with packed red blood cells to address his anemia.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his treatment plan as needed.
6. Consider restarting Asacol if the patient's UC flare resolves.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's depression and adjust his treatment plan as needed.
8. Consider restarting PPI and H2 blocker if the patient's thrombocytopenia resolves."

   24 Hour Events:
   - Goal fluid status -500 mL
   - Thrombocytopenia: will stop Vanc/Zosyn (Vanc could be contributing)
   and stop famotidine/pantoprazole. Most likely thrombocytopenia related
   to IABP.Did send off HIT Ab today.
   - ? Aspiration PNA: started Levaquin to replace Vanc/Zosyn
   -Holding Asacol per pharmacy (cannot crush PO and PR is only
   local).Emailed primary gastroenterologist re: PR Asacol.
   - Starting TF slowly
   - Afternoon gas showed improved O2 to 165 so FiO2 [**Month (only) 202**] to 50%-->repeat
   ABG O2 98 so FiO2 weaned to 40%
   - I/Os at 1730 showed -740 fluid balance p midnight but +190 since 8AM,
   with hourly UOP as low as 15cc/hr. Will re-check at 11PM and consider
   bolus/lasix.
   - Per GI ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6405**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6406**]), OK to hold Asacol if no signs of UC. If
   develops signs of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] use low-dose prednisone.
   -O/N pressures remained labile. Small adjustements to dopamine
   corrects.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Goal fluid status -500 mL
   - Thrombocytopenia: will stop Vanc/Zosyn (Vanc could be contributing)
   and stop famotidine/pantoprazole. Most likely thrombocytopenia related
   to IABP.Did send off HIT Ab today.
   - ? Aspiration PNA: started Levaquin to replace Vanc/Zosyn
   -Holding Asacol per pharmacy (cannot crush PO and PR is only
   local).Emailed primary gastroenterologist re: PR Asacol.
   - Starting TF slowly
   - Afternoon gas showed improved O2 to 165 so FiO2 [**Month (only) 202**] to 50%-->repeat
   ABG O2 98 so FiO2 weaned to 40%
   - I/Os at 1730 showed -740 fluid balance p midnight but +190 since 8AM,
   with hourly UOP as low as 15cc/hr. Will re-check at 11PM and consider
   bolus/lasix.
   - Per GI ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6405**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6406**]), OK to hold Asacol if no signs of UC. If
   develops signs of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] use low-dose prednisone.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and hypertension (HTN). He was admitted with a STEMI in the perioperative period and developed cardiogenic shock, which was treated with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). The patient's condition remains labile, with ongoing cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury (AKI).

The patient has been experiencing thrombocytopenia, which is likely related to the IABP. The platelet count has stabilized, and the patient is being treated with heparin and aspirin. The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped, and the anemia is likely related to hemolysis from the IABP.

The patient has been experiencing nausea and vomiting, which may be related to underlying gastrointestinal issues or sedating medications. The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, with ongoing hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient's metabolic acidosis has resolved, and the patient is being treated with diuresis to manage fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock remains untreated, and the patient is at risk of continued hemodynamic instability and cardiac arrest.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to hypoxia and respiratory arrest.
4. AKI: The patient's AKI may worsen, leading to further decline in renal function.
5. Hemolysis: The patient's hemolysis may worsen, leading to further anemia and potential bleeding complications.
6. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient's gastrointestinal issues may worsen, leading to further nausea, vomiting, and potential bowel obstruction.
7. Autonomic instability: The patient's autonomic instability may worsen, leading to further hemodynamic instability and potential cardiac arrest.

Recommendations:

1. Continue treatment with heparin and aspirin to manage thrombocytopenia.
2. Monitor the patient's hemoglobin level and consider transfusion if necessary.
3. Continue diuresis to manage fluid overload and improve respiratory status.
4. Wean the patient off dopamine and consider alternative vasopressors.
5. Consider adjusting the patient's sedation regimen to minimize gastrointestinal side effects.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary.
7. Consider consulting with a nephrologist to optimize management of AKI.
8. Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist to optimize management of gastrointestinal issues."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Goal fluid status -500 mL
   - Thrombocytopenia: will stop Vanc/Zosyn (Vanc could be contributing)
   and stop famotidine/pantoprazole. Most likely thrombocytopenia related
   to IABP.Did send off HIT Ab today.
   - ? Aspiration PNA: started Levaquin to replace Vanc/Zosyn
   -Holding Asacol per pharmacy (cannot crush PO and PR is only
   local).Emailed primary gastroenterologist re: PR Asacol.
   - Starting TF slowly
   - Afternoon gas showed improved O2 to 165 so FiO2 [**Month (only) 202**] to 50%-->repeat
   ABG O2 98 so FiO2 weaned to 40%
   - I/Os at 1730 showed -740 fluid balance p midnight but +190 since 8AM,
   with hourly UOP as low as 15cc/hr. Will re-check at 11PM and consider
   bolus/lasix.
   - Per GI ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6405**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6406**]), OK to hold Asacol if no signs of UC. If
   develops signs of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] use low-dose prednisone.

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of coronary artery disease, ulcerative colitis, and coronary artery bypass graft. He is currently receiving mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and inotropes for cardiogenic shock. He has developed thrombocytopenia, which is likely related to the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). The patient's platelet count has decreased from 121 to 111 K/uL.

The patient's 24-hour events include:

* Goal fluid status -500 mL
* Thrombocytopenia, which is being managed by stopping vancomycin and famotidine/pantoprazole
* Aspiration pneumonia, for which he is receiving antibiotics
* Holding Asacol due to concerns about UC exacerbation
* Starting TF slowly
* Improved oxygenation, with FiO2 weaned from 50% to 40%
* Fluid balance of -740 mL at midnight, with hourly urine output as low as 15cc/hr
* Ongoing labile pressures, requiring small adjustments to dopamine
* Trending down heart rate, potentially related to autonomic dysregulation
* ABG results showing pH 7.41, PaCO2 36, and PaO2 74 on 40% FiO2

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia, particularly with the IABP in place.
2. Continued cardiac instability, potentially leading to further hemodynamic compromise.
3. Respiratory failure, particularly if the patient's oxygenation does not improve or worsens.
4. Infection, particularly with the aspiration pneumonia and potential VAP.
5. Gastrointestinal complications, such as UC exacerbation or bowel ischemia, due to the holding of Asacol.
6. Autonomic dysregulation, potentially leading to further hemodynamic instability.
7. Nutritional deficiencies, particularly if the patient's caloric needs are not being met.
8. Worsening of underlying medical conditions, such as CAD and ulcerative colitis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust therapy accordingly.
2. Closely monitor the patient's cardiac status, including hemodynamic parameters and cardiac enzymes.
3. Maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and consider weaning the patient from mechanical ventilation if possible.
4. Continue to manage the patient's fluid status, aiming for a balanced fluid intake and output.
5. Consider adding anticoagulation therapy to prevent further thrombosis.
6. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust caloric intake accordingly.
7. Consider adding prophylactic antibiotics to prevent VAP and other infections.

   # PUMP: Still volume up.Put out well to 40 IV lasix.
   - Goal I/O -1000 cc today
   .
   # RHYTHM: Mostly NSR with rate 50s-60s, sporadic PVCs. Hold BB.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT and PLTslightly improved. Will follow today and consider
   transfusion if continues to drop.
   - Continue to avoid drugs that may cause thrombocytopenia
   - Transfusion for Hct<21 or >3pt Hct drop
   .
   # Abd Distension: Active bowel sounds though nearly no stool output
   past few days. Possible to could represent obstruction versus ileus
   versus reduced gastric motlity secondary to limited feeding.
   - KUB to r/o obstruction
   -Holding TF [**1-1**] high residulas
   - Consider reglan to improve motility if no obstruction on KUB
   .
   # Resp Failure/Aspiration:
   - CXR to assess tube placement
   - Cont to wean FiO2
   - frequent suctioning
   - continue nebs
   - Continue levaquin for asp PNA
DC tomorrow for 10 day course
   .
   # ARF. Cre improved O/N.
   - monitor daily lytes, renally dose meds
   .
   # s/p shoulder surgery
   - continue pain control with fentanyl bolus prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the 24-hour progress note, the patient is a 66-inch tall male with a weight of 86.9 kg, admitted with cardiogenic shock and STEMI. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 70% and PEEP of 8 cmH2O.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 127/62 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on a FiO2 of 70%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.4, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 111 K/uL. The patient's creatinine is 1.3 mg/dL, and the patient's lactate level is 0.9 mmol/L.

The patient's medical conditions include cardiogenic shock, STEMI, and anemia. The patient is receiving treatment for these conditions, including dopamine, heparin, and ASA 325.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and a SpO2 of 99% on a FiO2 of 70%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.37, pCO2 of 42 mmHg, and pO2 of 120 mmHg.

The patient's abdominal distension is present, with active bowel sounds but nearly no stool output over the past few days. The patient's KUB is pending to rule out obstruction.

The patient's plans include continuing to wean dopamine, discontinuing heparin, and starting sucralfate for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and the patient's ABG results show a pCO2 of 42 mmHg. The patient's FiO2 is 70%, and the patient's PEEP is 8 cmH2O. The patient may require further respiratory support.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The patient may be at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is receiving antibiotics. The patient may be at risk for sepsis, particularly if the patient's infection is not adequately treated.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is receiving anticoagulation therapy. The patient may be at risk for further gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a platelet count of 111 K/uL, which is below the normal range. The patient may be at risk for further thrombocytopenia, particularly if the patient is receiving medications that can cause thrombocytopenia.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but the patient is at risk for various medical complications. The patient's treatment plan should be carefully monitored and adjusted as necessary to prevent these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with cardiogenic shock and STEM (ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction). He has been treated with IABP (Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump) and dopamine, and his blood pressure has improved. His cardiac function is still compromised, and he requires continued monitoring and treatment.

The patient has also been experiencing respiratory failure, with an O2 saturation of 88% on 70% FiO2, and has been intubated and mechanically ventilated. His chest x-ray shows a slightly worsened effusion. He has been treated with antibiotics and has a positive response to treatment.

The patient's abdominal distension has improved, but he still has active bowel sounds and is at risk for obstruction or ileus. He has been treated with lasix and is being monitored for further improvement.

The patient's anemia has improved slightly, but he is still at risk for further decline. He has been treated with blood transfusions and is being monitored for further improvement.

The patient's depression is being treated with celexa, and his GERD is being managed with sucralfate. He is also being treated for a urinary tract infection with levaquin.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac function is still compromised, and he is at risk for further decline.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's O2 saturation is still low, and he is at risk for further respiratory compromise.
3. Abdominal distension: The patient's abdominal distension has improved, but he is still at risk for obstruction or ileus.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia has improved slightly, but he is still at risk for further decline.
5. Depression: The patient's depression is being treated with celexa, but he is still at risk for further decline.
6. GERD: The patient's GERD is being managed with sucralfate, but he is still at risk for further complications.
7. Urinary tract infection: The patient's urinary tract infection is being treated with levaquin, but he is still at risk for further complications.

Overall, the patient is at risk for further medical complications, and close monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent further decline."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # Cardiogenic Shock/STEMI. Latest Co/CI/SVR=7.3/3.9/722. Remains very
   labile O/N but less highs/lows than yesterday. Likely a component of
   autonomic dysregulation.
   - Plan to cont IABP on 1:1
   - Continue dopamine for pressure support
   - Repeat Fick calculations with change in pressors
   - Continue ASA 325, Plavix 75, heparin gtt for IABP, simva 80.
   - Try to wean FiO2 again today.
   .
   # PUMP: Still volume up. Did not receive lasix yesterday.
   - 20 mg this AM. Goal I/O -500 cc if BP allows
   - Continue afterload reduction with IABP, consider ACE if Cre allows.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Mostly NSR with rate 50s-60s, sporadic PVCs. Hold BB.
   .
   # Anemia: PLT stabilized but Hct dropping. Will follow today and
   consider transfusion if continues to drop.
   - Continue to avoid drugs that may cause thrombocytopenia
   .
   # Vomiting: resolved
   .
   # Resp Failure/Aspiration:
   - Try to wean FiO2 again today to 40%
   - frequent suctioning
   - continue COPD meds
   - Continue levaquin instead of Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   # ARF. Cre improved O/N.
   - monitor daily lytes, renally dose meds
   .
   # s/p shoulder surgery
   - continue pain control with fentanyl bolus prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-inch tall, 86.9 kg male with a history of cardiogenic shock and STEM (ST elevation myocardial infarction). He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 70% and PEEP of 8 cmH2O.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 40s, which is managed with dopamine infusion. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 12 mmHg, and his pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) is 52/22 mmHg.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, with an ABG showing a pH of 7.37, PCO2 of 42 mmHg, and PO2 of 84 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and his SpO2 is 99%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 6.4-8.0 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.6-10.2 g/dL
* Platelet count (PLT): 111-114 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.3-1.5 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 15.28 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L

The patient's medications include:

* Dopamine infusion
* Heparin sodium infusion
* Midazolam (Versed) infusion
* Fentanyl (Concentrate) infusion
* Furosemide (Lasix) 20 mg IV
* ASA 325 mg PO
* Plavix 75 mg PO
* Heparin gtt for IABP
* Simvastatin 80 mg PO
* Levaquin 500 mg IV q12h

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing IABP on 1:1
* Continuing dopamine infusion for pressure support
* Repeating Fick calculations with change in pressors
* Weaning FiO2 to 40% if possible
* Monitoring daily lytes and renally dosing medications
* Continuing pain control with fentanyl bolus prn
* Monitoring for signs of bleeding and adjusting medications accordingly

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiogenic shock
* Respiratory failure
* Acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Thrombocytopenia
* Bleeding complications
* Autonomic dysregulation
* Aspiration pneumonia
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Depression
* GERD
* FEN (fetal exposure to narcotics)

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and hemodynamic status to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with cardiogenic shock and STEMI. He has been intubated and is receiving dopamine for pressure support. His cardiac index is 3.7 L/min/m2, and his mixed venous oxygen saturation is 59-69%. He has a slightly worsened effusion on chest X-ray and is receiving heparin and ASA 325. His blood pressure is labile, and he is at risk for autonomic dysregulation. He is also experiencing anemia, with a decreasing hematocrit, and is at risk for thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac index is low, and he is at risk for further decline in cardiac function.
2. Autonomic dysregulation: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and he is at risk for further fluctuations in blood pressure.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient is at risk for thrombocytopenia due to his medications and underlying condition.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is decreasing, and he may require transfusion.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, but he is at risk for further decline in lung function.
6. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is at risk for further decline in kidney function.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his indwelling lines and catheters.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to his medications and underlying condition.

Plan:

1. Continue IABP on 1:1 and dopamine for pressure support.
2. Repeat Fick calculations with change in pressors.
3. Continue ASA 325, Plavix 75, heparin gtt for IABP, simva 80.
4. Try to wean FiO2 again today to 40%.
5. Monitor daily lytes, renally dose meds.
6. Consider transfusion if the patient's hematocrit continues to drop.
7. Continue to avoid drugs that may cause thrombocytopenia.
8. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation as needed.
9. Monitor the patient's renal status and adjust medications as needed.
10. Consider prophylactic antibiotics for the patient's indwelling lines and catheters."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient has continued to progress in the ICU with a focus on weaning from mechanical ventilation and managing various medical complications. Key events over the past 24 hours include:

* Fluid balance remains negative, with a net loss of 1.6L
* The patient's cortisol level has increased, and hydrocortisone was started at 50mg q6 to manage potential adrenal insufficiency
* The patient's dopamine infusion was weaned off, and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was removed
* A KUB (kidney, ureter, bladder) study revealed a nonspecific bowel pattern, and the patient was started on reglan and dulcolax to manage constipation
* The patient remains intubated and sedated, but responds to pain
* Vital signs and hemodynamic monitoring remain stable
* The patient's physical examination is notable for soft, mildly distended abdomen with tympanic percussion and bilateral dopplerable pulses

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Fluid imbalance: The patient's ongoing fluid loss may lead to hypovolemia, hypotension, and organ dysfunction.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's cortisol level remains low, and hydrocortisone supplementation may not be sufficient to manage potential adrenal insufficiency.
3. Constipation: The patient's KUB study revealed a nonspecific bowel pattern, and the patient is at risk for constipation, which may lead to bowel obstruction, perforation, or other complications.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient remains intubated, and the risk of VAP remains high.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and other risk factors.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness may lead to stress ulceration, which can cause bleeding, perforation, or other complications.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are not specified, but the patient's critical illness and medication regimen may put them at risk for hypoglycemia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with cardiogenic shock and STEMIs. He has been weaned off DA and IABP, and his pressures have stabilized. He is currently receiving hydrocortisone 50mg q6 for suspected adrenal insufficiency. His fluid balance is negative 1.6L, and he is receiving IV fluids and diuretics to manage his volume status.

The patient's laboratory results show improving anemia, with a rising platelet count and increasing hematocrit. His creatinine level has stabilized at 1.3mg/dL, and his lactate level is 0.9mmol/L.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 98% and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 160. He is receiving 70% FiO2 and PEEP of 8 cmH2O.

The patient's abdominal examination is notable for mild distension and tympanitic bowel sounds, and he is receiving an aggressive bowel regimen to manage constipation.

Potential medical complications:

1. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's failed corticotropin stimulation test suggests adrenal insufficiency, which could worsen his hypotension and cardiovascular instability.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he is at risk for further deterioration due to his underlying cardiogenic shock and potential aspiration.
3. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's abdominal distension and tympanitic bowel sounds suggest the possibility of abdominal compartment syndrome, which could worsen his respiratory and cardiovascular instability.
4. Sepsis: The patient's positive fluid balance and elevated lactate level suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could worsen his cardiovascular instability and increase his risk of organ failure.
5. GI bleeding: The patient's constipation and abdominal distension suggest the possibility of GI bleeding, which could worsen his anemia and cardiovascular instability.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's fluid balance and adjust his diuretic therapy as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's adrenal function and adjust his hydrocortisone dose as needed.
3. Continue to optimize the patient's respiratory therapy, including weaning his FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's abdominal status and adjust his bowel regimen as needed.
5. Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's regimen if his sepsis is suspected.
6. Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist to evaluate the patient's GI bleeding risk and to develop a plan for managing his constipation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the 24-hour events, the patient's condition is as follows:

* Fluid balance is negative 1.6L, indicating ongoing fluid loss.
* The patient's cardiac status is stable, with pressures ranging from 81/40 to 126/69 mmHg, and Fick numbers indicating cardiac output and index of 7.1 L/min and 3.8 L/min/m2, respectively.
* The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 136/56 mmHg, and central venous pressure of 18 mmHg.
* The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O.
* The patient's abdominal distension is likely due to constipation, and an aggressive bowel regimen has been started.
* The patient's renal function is improving, with a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL.
* The patient's anemia is improving, with a hemoglobin level of 27.9 g/dL.
* The patient's platelet count is increasing, with a level of 150,000/mm3.
* The patient's adrenal function is being monitored due to suspected adrenal insufficiency, and hydrocortisone 50 mg q6 has been started.
* The patient's pain is being managed with fentanyl and Haldol PRN.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Fluid overload: The patient's negative fluid balance may lead to fluid overload if not carefully monitored and managed.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's underlying cardiac condition and the use of vasopressors.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying lung disease and the use of vasopressors.
* Abdominal complications: The patient's abdominal distension may lead to abdominal complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation if not carefully managed.
* Renal failure: The patient's renal function is improving, but there is a risk of renal failure due to the patient's underlying kidney disease and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia is improving, but there is a risk of anemia worsening due to ongoing bleeding or bone marrow suppression.
* Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's adrenal function is being monitored due to suspected adrenal insufficiency, and there is a risk of adrenal insufficiency worsening if not carefully managed.
* Pain management: The patient's pain is being managed with fentanyl and Haldol PRN, but there is a risk of inadequate pain management if not carefully monitored and managed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 66-inch tall, 86.9 kg individual who is intubated and sedated. They are receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 70% and PEEP of 8 cmH2O. They have been weaned off dopamine and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). The patient's fluid balance is negative 1.6L, and they have been receiving hydrocortisone 50mg q6 due to suspected adrenal insufficiency. They have also been started on reglan and dulcolax for bowel management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 136/56 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Their respiratory support is stable, with a tidal volume of 550 mL and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.0 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 114 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 23 mEq/L
* Sodium: 139 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.1 mEq/L
* Chloride: 101 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.6 mg/dL

The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a heart rate of 99 bpm and a blood pressure of 136/56 mmHg. They have been weaned off dopamine and IABP, and their pressures have ranged from 81/40 to 126/69 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's cortisol levels are not mentioned in the note, but the patient's blood pressure is unstable, and they have been started on hydrocortisone 50mg q6. This suggests that the patient may have adrenal insufficiency, which can lead to hypotension, shock, and even death.
2. Constipation: The patient's abdomen is distended, and they have been started on an aggressive bowel regimen to manage constipation. If left untreated, constipation can lead to bowel obstruction, perforation, and even death.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, and their respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. If the patient's respiratory status deteriorates, they may require more aggressive respiratory support, including intubation and mechanical ventilation.
4. Cardiac failure: The patient has a history of cardiogenic shock and STEMIs. If their cardiac status deteriorates, they may require more aggressive cardiac support, including vasopressors and inotropes.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and they have been receiving diuretics to manage fluid overload. If their renal function deteriorates further, they may require dialysis.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of upper GI bleeding, and they are receiving anticoagulation therapy. If they develop further bleeding, they may require transfusions and further management.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but they are at risk for a variety of medical complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with cardiogenic shock, acute myocardial infarction (STEMI), and respiratory failure. He was intubated and mechanically ventilated, but was extubated today with a SpO2 of 92-97% on 6L NC. He developed hypertension, hypoxia, and crackles on exam, which responded to treatment with IV lasix, BIPAP, and nitro drip. He also has a history of coronary artery disease, ulcerative colitis, and coronary artery bypass graft.

The patient's vital signs are:

* T: 36.5°C (97.7°F)
* HR: 94 bpm (78-114 bpm)
* BP: 152/64 mmHg (94-152/64-70 mmHg)
* RR: 34 breaths/min (14-42 breaths/min)
* SpO2: 93%

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 6.0-9.1 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 25.8-27.7%
* Plt: 127-205 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 1.2-1.3 mg/dL
* TCO2: 22-27 mmHg
* Glucose: 97-104 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Metoprolol
* Furosemide (Lasix)
* Morphine sulfate
* Carafate (sucralfate)
* Heparin sodium (prophylaxis)
* Captopril
* Aspirin (ASA)
* Plavix
* Simvastatin
* Albuterol
* Ipratropium
* Ondansetron
* Zofran
* Miconazole powder
* Fentanyl
* Senna
* Colace
* Asacol
* Celexa

Potential medical complications:

* Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further decline in cardiac function and increased risk of mortality.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further decline in lung function and increased risk of mortality.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output may indicate acute kidney injury, which can worsen if not properly managed.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to increased risk of bleeding.
* Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may worsen if not properly managed, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
* Dizziness: The patient's dizziness may worsen if not properly managed, leading to falls and increased risk of injury.
* Abdominal distension: The patient's abdominal distension may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further decline in bowel function and increased risk of complications.
* Ulcerative colitis: The patient's ulcerative colitis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further decline in bowel function and increased risk of complications.

Recommendations:

* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiogenic shock and respiratory failure closely.
* Adjust the patient's medications as necessary to manage his cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, and other medical conditions.
* Monitor the patient's lab results closely for signs of acute kidney injury, thrombocytopenia, and other complications.
* Provide supportive care, such as pain management and nutritional support, as needed.
* Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist to manage the patient's ulcerative colitis.
* Consider consulting with a cardiologist to manage the patient's cardiogenic shock and other cardiac conditions.
* Consider consulting with a pulmonologist to manage the patient's respiratory failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of CAD, s/p CABG, PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, who presented with STEMI and cardiogenic shock following acromioplasty. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamically stable with no episodes of hypotension
* BPs continue to stabilize
* Respiratory status is improving, with SpO2 of 95-97% on 2L NC
* Clinically euvolemic, with a goal of even fluid balance
* Creatinine has increased from 1.2 to 1.5, likely due to aggressive diuresis
* Anemia is present, with a hemoglobin level of 31.6 g/dL
* Acidemia has resolved, but Alkalemic yesterday, suggesting respiratory alkalosis
* Renal function is impaired, with a baseline Cr of 1.3 and now 1.5

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: Cardiogenic shock, STEMI, and cardiorenal syndrome can lead to cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and further cardiac damage.
2. Renal complications: Acute kidney injury (AKI) can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD), requiring dialysis and increasing the risk of cardiovascular events.
3. Respiratory complications: Respiratory failure can lead to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and ventilator-associated complications.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: Ulcerative colitis can exacerbate with increased inflammation and bleeding, requiring closer monitoring and treatment.
5. Infection: Aspiration pneumonia is a risk due to the patient's recent surgery and cardiogenic shock, which can lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and recent surgery increase the risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and hematoma.
7. Pain management: The patient's pain control requires close monitoring, as excessive pain can lead to agitation, respiratory compromise, and further complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue ASA 325, plavix 600, SQ heparin, simvastatin 80, metoprolol 12.5 mg PO daily, and increase lisinopril to 10 mg PO daily.
2. Hold diuresis for now, trend creatinine and lytes, and renally dose meds.
3. Schedule follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 413**] for [**5-10**] days.
4. Continue pain management with fentanyl bolus prn.
5. Monitor electrolytes and replete as needed.
6. Continue prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
7. Monitor for signs of infection, bleeding, and respiratory compromise.

The patient's disposition is to be transferred to the floor today pending full 24 hours of hemodynamically stable care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who was admitted to the ICU with cardiogenic shock and STEMI following an acromioplasty procedure. The patient's condition has been stable, with no episodes of hypotension, and his hemodynamics have improved. He is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy, antiplatelet therapy, and beta-blockers. The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.2 to 1.5, likely due to aggressive diuresis, and his electrolytes are being monitored. The patient is also experiencing anterior left knee pain, which is thought to be related to forceful restraining during periods of agitation while sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's condition remains critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration if his hemodynamics do not continue to improve.
2. STEMI: The patient's STEMI is unresolved, and there is a risk of further cardiac complications if it is not adequately treated.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level has increased, and there is a risk of further kidney damage if his diuresis is not managed carefully.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are being monitored, but there is a risk of further imbalance if his diuresis is not managed carefully.
5. Pulmonary edema: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but there is a risk of pulmonary edema if his diuresis is not managed carefully.
6. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and there is a risk of sepsis if his infection is not adequately treated.
7. Ulcerative colitis: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis, and there is a risk of further complications if his disease is not adequately managed.
8. Depression: The patient has a history of depression, and there is a risk of further complications if his mental health is not adequately managed.
9. GERD: The patient has a history of GERD, and there is a risk of further complications if his esophageal symptoms are not adequately managed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cardiogenic shock, STEMI, and recent L shoulder surgery. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamically stable with no episodes of hypotension
* Cardiogenic shock and STEMI are being managed with ASA 325, Plavix 600, SQ heparin, simvastatin 80, and metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID
* Increased lisinopril to 10 mg PO daily
* Creatinine has increased from 1.2 to 1.5, likely due to aggressive diuresis
* Patient is clinically euvolemic, with a goal of even fluid balance
* Respiratory status is improving, with oxygen saturation at 95-97% on 2L NC
* Repeat CXR is pending
* Patient remains constipated and needs aggressive bowel regimen
* Acidemia has resolved, but Alkalemic pH is suggestive of respiratory alkalosis
* ABG is pending to trend acid/base status
* Patient has anemia, but no iron deficiency, rectal blood loss, or hemolysis
* Patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and GERD, and is being managed with Asacol and H2 blocker, respectively

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest, due to cardiogenic shock and STEMI
* Renal failure, due to aggressive diuresis and increased creatinine levels
* Respiratory failure, due to respiratory alkalosis and potential pneumonia
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation, due to constipation and ulcerative colitis
* Infection, due to catheter-related bloodstream infections or pneumonia
* Bleeding, due to anticoagulation therapy and potential gastrointestinal bleeding

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust therapy as needed to prevent these complications and ensure optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to
   LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and Diagonal), PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia here with
   STEMI s/p acromioplasty
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI:
   - BPs continue to stabilize, hemodynamically stable with no episodes of
   hypotension.
   - continue ASA 325, plavix 600, SQ heparin, simvastatin 80, metoprolol
   12.5 mg PO BID
   - Increase lisinopril to 10 mg PO daily
   # Cards Pump: Met diuresis goal of -1L yesterday to 20 mg lasix x2 but
   failed to put out urine without foley
   - Cre bump 1.2 - 1.5
   - Clinically euvolemic, resp status continuing to improve on O2 by NC.
   - Goal even today.
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 80s.
   # Resp Failure: Pt with increased WOB and crackles. Significantly
   improved, now 95-97% on 2L NC.
   - repeat CXR
   - diuresis as above pending volume status and CXR
   - finished abx course for aspiration, remains afebrile
   - incentive spirometry
   #Anemia: Slightly improved from yesterday, Hct 31.1. No iron
   deficiency, no rectal blood loss, no hemolysis. Will trend.
   #N/V: remains constipated and likely needs aggressive bowel regimen
   - Fleet enema today, Zofran PRN; follow clinically
   # Acid/Base: Acidemia has resolved, but Alkalemic yesterday pH
   7.48/36/143, suggestive of respiratory alkalosis.
   - ABG today to trend acid/base status
   # ARF: baseline Cr 1.3 - now 1.5. Likely r/t aggressive diuresis
   - hold diuresis for now, trend creatinine and lytes, renally dose meds
   - if cont [**Month (only) 202**] urine output will bolus IVF
   # s/p shoulder surgery - pain control w fentanyl bolus prn.
   - will schedule f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 413**] for [**5-10**]
   - per ortho: ROM as tolerated, WB < 5 lbs, sling until [**5-10**]
   # Ulcerative colitis: all guaiacs negative. continue asacol 1600 [**Hospital1 **]
   # depression: celexa
   # hx of GERD: use H2 blocker instead of PPI since plavix
   FEN: tolerating POs; replete electrolytes as needed
   ACCESS: PIVs
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx: SC heparin
   -Pain management with fentanyl PRN
   -Bowel regimen with senna/colace, with reglan, dulcolax as needed
