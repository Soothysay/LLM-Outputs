   extravasation in the cecum, localizing
   this as the likely site of bleeding. the wall of the cecum and
   ascending colon are thickened. additional wall thickening is seen
   involving the splenic flexure, descending and sigmoid colon, albeit
   exagerrated by underdistention. this is consistent with colitis, which
   may be infectious or ischemic given underlying atherosclerosis. there
   is diffuse atheroscrlotic involvement of the aorta and mesenteric
   vessels, though all appear patent. the SMV is patent. Abd/pelv: no
   acute abnormality involving the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas or
   adrenals. s/p right nephrectomy. left kidney markedly atrophic. small
   bowel appears normal though note is made of a bowel contained in a
   right inguinal hernia without evidence of complciation.
   Assessment and Plan
   79 y/o M with history of ESRD on HD, RCC and prostate cancer who
   presents from nursing home with BRBPR, hematocrit drop, episode of and
   hypotension, now transferred back to MICU for recurrent BRBPR and
   hypotension, s/p IR procedure.
   .
   # GI BLEED: No active bleed at time of colonoscopy but found to have
   multiple areas of erythema and ulcerations; current bleed appears to
   localize to cecum. S/p IR embolization of area in the ascending colon.
   HCT post-procedure unchanged.  He has received a total of 6 units PRBCs
   since [**3-6**] at 6pm.
   - 2 large bore IV for access
   - active type and screen
   - serial HCT Q6hr
   - transfuse to HCT >26
   - protonix 40 mg IV BID
   - cont to hold plavix, aspirin
   - cont hold antihypertensives in setting of GIB; if needed for bp
   control will try esmolol gtt or nitro gtt, carefully
   - appreciate GI, IR, and surgery recs
   - monitor CVP
   - Cipro IV in the setting of colitis seen on CTA of abdomen
   - replete calcium prn
   .
   LEUKOCYTOSIS: Pt with GPC UTI (strep viridans) with 2/4 blood cx also
   growing GPC (coag neg staph); may have infectious colitis.  Afebrile in
   last 24 hours. (NB any fevers that do develop may be secondary to blood
   products). WBC trending down.
   - check c.diff  (ordered, not yet logged)
   - check stools studies (not yet ordered)
   - blood culture f/u
   - continue vancomycin per HD protocol (ID approval required)
   - cont empiric cipro IV, today day 5 of 7 (day 1 = [**3-4**])
   - consider starting flagyl if persistent diarrhea
   - ensure that microbiology is speciating blood cx specimen
   .
   ESRD on HD: Patient on M/W/F schedule with right fistula for access;
   last performed on Friday at Fresenius ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 14461**]).  Patient has
   received a large volume in the past 24 hours. Renal following.
   - Follow up final renal recs: initial plan was to hold HD today, but
   after re-eval will dialyze today.
   - continue phosLo and calcium acetate
   .
   ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient with [**Location (un) 1204**] risk factors of DM, HTN
   without anginal symptoms per history, without EKG changes, with
   elevated troponin on admission on [**2136-3-4**] but normal CK in the setting
   of ESRD. Most likely due to renal failure although also included in the
   differential are transient ischemia in the setting of hypotension or
   tachycardia.
   - cycle enzymes
   .
   HYPERTENSION
   - hold antihypertensives for now in setting of GIB

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a complex medical history, including ESRD on HD, RCC, and prostate cancer. He was admitted to the ICU with BRBPR, hematocrit drop, and hypotension, and was subsequently transferred back to the MICU for recurrent BRBPR and hypotension.

The patient has undergone an IR procedure for embolization of the ascending colon, which localized the bleeding to the cecum. He has received a total of 6 units of PRBCs since admission and is currently receiving IV fluids, vasopressors, and blood products.

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* Elevated troponin levels, which may be due to renal failure or transient ischemia
* Leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14.2, which may be secondary to GPC UTI or infectious colitis
* Elevated lipase levels, which may be due to pancreatitis or hyperlipidemia
* Elevated liver enzymes, which may be due to liver dysfunction or medication side effects
* Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, which may indicate kidney dysfunction

The patient's medications include:

* Cipro IV for colitis
* Vancomycin for GPC UTI
* Protonix for GIB
* Calcium acetate for hypercalcemia
* PhosLo for hyperphosphatemia
* Statin for hyperlipidemia
* Allopurinol for gout
* Aricept and risperidone for dementia

The patient's medical complications include:

* GIB with bleeding localized to the cecum
* Infectious colitis or pancreatitis
* Hyperlipidemia
* Gout
* Dementia
* ESRD on HD

The patient's plan includes:

* Continued IV fluids and vasopressors to support blood pressure
* Blood product transfusions as needed
* Antibiotics for GPC UTI and colitis
* Proton pump inhibitors for GIB
* Calcium and phosphorus repletion
* Statin therapy for hyperlipidemia
* Allopurinol therapy for gout

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's ongoing kidney injury and elevated creatinine level put them at risk for AKI.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and gastrointestinal bleeding increase their risk for developing sepsis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory support and elevated respiratory rate increase their risk for developing respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's electrolyte abnormalities and ongoing vasopressor therapy increase their risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and ongoing anticoagulation therapy increase their risk for bleeding complications.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities, including chronic renal failure, leukocytosis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient requires ongoing ICU care, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy. The patient's laboratory results indicate ongoing kidney injury, leukocytosis, and gastrointestinal bleeding, and potential medical complications include AKI, sepsis, respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and bleeding complications."

   ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient with [**Location (un) 1204**] risk factors of DM, HTN
   without anginal symptoms per history, without EKG changes, with
   elevated troponin on admission on [**2136-3-4**] but normal CK in the setting
   of ESRD. Most likely due to renal failure although also included in the
   differential are transient ischemia in the setting of hypotension or
   tachycardia.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a complex medical history, including ESRD on HD, RCC, and prostate cancer. He was admitted to the ICU with BRBPR, hematocrit drop, and hypotension, and was transferred back to the ICU for recurrent BRBPR and hypotension.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring shows a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 109/51 mmHg, and a SpO2 of 98%.
* Laboratory results show:
	+ Elevated troponin levels, which may be due to renal failure or transient ischemia
	+ Elevated white blood cell count, which may be due to GPC UTI or colitis
	+ Elevated liver enzymes, which may be due to colitis or liver dysfunction
	+ Electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia and hypocalcemia
* Radiology results show:
	+ CTA of the abdomen and pelvis shows intraluminal contrast extravasation in the cecum, consistent with colitis
	+ Microbiological results show GPC UTI and strep viridans in the urine
* Medications:
	+ Protonix 40 mg IV BID
	+ Cipro IV
	+ Vancomycin
	+ PhosLo and calcium acetate

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Continued bleeding from the cecum, which may lead to hypovolemic shock and death
* Infection from the GPC UTI or colitis, which may lead to sepsis and death
* Electrolyte imbalances, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and death
* Renal failure, which may lead to acute kidney injury and death
* Cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias, which may lead to death

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, RCC, and prostate cancer, who presents to the ICU with recurrent BRBPR and hypotension. The patient has undergone an IR procedure for embolization of an area in the ascending colon, which appears to be the site of bleeding.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, likely due to renal failure, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gout, and dementia.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has had multiple episodes of GIB, which has resulted in the need for blood transfusions and has been managed with proton pump inhibitors and anticoagulation therapy.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has a white blood cell count of 14.2, which is elevated. The patient has a history of GPC UTI and has been treated with vancomycin.
3. ESRD on HD: The patient is on hemodialysis three times a week and has had a large volume of fluid removed in the past 12 hours.
4. Elevated troponin: The patient has elevated troponin levels, which may be due to renal failure or transient ischemia.
5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with antihypertensive medications.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, which is being managed with statins.
7. Gout: The patient has gout, which is being managed with allopurinol.
8. Dementia: The patient has dementia, which is being managed with Aricept.

The patient's current medications include:

* Proton pump inhibitors (PPI)
* Vancomycin
* Ciprofloxacin
* PhosLo
* Calcium acetate
* Allopurinol
* Aricept

The patient's current therapy includes:

* IV fluids and electrolyte repletion
* Blood transfusions
* Proton pump inhibitors and anticoagulation therapy for GIB
* Vancomycin for UTI
* Ciprofloxacin for colitis
* PhosLo and calcium acetate for ESRD
* Allopurinol for gout
* Aricept for dementia

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.9°C
* Heart rate: 89 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 109/51 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%

The patient's current physical examination shows:

* Right DP pulse palpable, left DP pulse dopplerable
* Right PT pulse dopplerable, left PT pulse not able to be assessed by Doppler due to patient position
* Neurologic: Sleeping, not arousable to voice
* HEENT: Mucous membranes moist
* CV: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur/rub/gallop
* Pulm: Transmitted upper airway sounds (patient snoring), otherwise clear to auscultation
* Ab: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present
* Right groin at site of femoral artery catheterization: no mass or ecchymosis present, no bleeding from site

The patient's current laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 26.1%
* White blood cell count: 14.2
* Platelet count: 190
* Creatinine: 5.1 mg/dL
* Troponin: 0.19
* C-reactive protein: 38 mg/dL
* Liver function tests: Abnormal
* Electrolyte levels: Abnormal

The patient's current diagnosis is:

* Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB)
* Leukocytosis
* ESRD on HD
* Elevated troponin
* Hypertension
* Hyperlipidemia
* Gout
* Dementia

The patient's current plan is:

* Continue proton pump inhibitors and anticoagulation therapy for GIB

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   hypertension. Elevated PTT in setting of subQ heparin.  Surgery met
   with family and plan was is for medical management.
   - Got 2 units PRBC on [**3-7**] (10am, 12:30pm) and bolused 500cc.  Started
   briefly on nitro gtt for hypertension but dropped pressure to SBP of
   60s, stopped and over time returned to 110-120s/60s where he remained
   most of the night. HCT trended Q6 = ~29 at 9pm; 26 at 3am; getting 1
   unit more at 5am-7am (for total of 6 units since 6pm on [**3-6**])

   extravasation in the cecum, localizing
   this as the likely site of bleeding. the wall of the cecum and
   ascending colon are thickened. additional wall thickening is seen
   involving the splenic flexure, descending and sigmoid colon, albeit
   exagerrated by underdistention. this is consistent with colitis, which
   may be infectious or ischemic given underlying atherosclerosis. there
   is diffuse atheroscrlotic involvement of the aorta and mesenteric
   vessels, though all appear patent. the SMV is patent. Abd/pelv: no
   acute abnormality involving the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas or

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, RCC, and prostate cancer who presented to the ICU with BRBPR, hematocrit drop, and hypotension. He has undergone an IR procedure for GI bleed and has received 6 units of PRBCs since admission.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T-max 36.9°C (98.4°F), T-current 36.7°C (98°F), HR 89 bpm (85-139 bpm), BP 109/51 mmHg (66-203/93-119 mmHg), RR 23 insp/min, SpO2 98%.
* Respiratory support: Oxygen delivery device - nasal cannula, 2L, ABG - pH 7.30, pCO2 38 mmHg, pO2 101 mmHg, HCO3- 20 mEq/L, BE -6 mEq/L.
* Physical examination: Alert, oriented to person, with a soft, non-tender, non-distended abdomen, and bowel sounds present. Right DP pulse palpable, left DP pulse dopplerable, right PT pulse dopplerable, and left PT pulse not assessable by Doppler due to patient position, not palpable.

The patient has the following medical complications:

* Leukocytosis: Patient has GPC UTI (strep viridans) with 2/4 blood cx also growing GPC (coag neg staph); may have infectious colitis.
* ESRD on HD: Patient on M/W/F schedule with right fistula for access; last performed on Friday at Fresenius.
* Elevated troponin: Patient with [**Location (un) 1204**] risk factors of DM, HTN without anginal symptoms per history, without EKG changes, with elevated troponin on admission on [**2136-3-4**] but normal CK in the setting of ESRD.
* Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now in setting of GIB.
* Hyperlipidemia: Statin.
* Gout: Allopurinol.
* Dementia: Aricept, risperidone.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* GI bleed: No active bleed at time of colonoscopy, but found to have multiple areas of erythema and ulcerations; current bleed appears to localize to cecum. S/p IR embolization of area in the ascending colon.
* Leukocytosis: Check c.diff, check stools studies, blood culture f/u, continue vancomycin per HD protocol, and consider starting flagyl if persistent diarrhea.
* ESRD on HD: Follow up final renal recs, continue phosLo and calcium acetate.
* Elevated troponin: Cycle enzymes.
* Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now in setting of GIB.
* Hyperlipidemia: Statin.
* Gout: Allopurinol.
* Dementia: Aricept, risperidone.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis: Given the patient's leukocytosis and GPC UTI, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
* Renal failure: The patient's ESRD on HD and recent large volume of IV fluids may increase the risk of developing renal failure.
* GI bleeding: The patient's recent GI bleed and ongoing colitis may lead to further bleeding.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's elevated troponin and hypertension may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying respiratory disease and recent respiratory support may increase the risk of respiratory failure.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as necessary to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   - Sensitivities added on for coag-neg staph blood culture
   - C. Diff negative
   - IR recs: pt not surgical candidate; if bleeding continues consider
   repeat colonoscopy for endoscopic treatment. If pt unstable, call IR
   for re-eval.
   - Paged GI; says no isolated source of bleeding, just diffuse oozing
   from 20 cm region throughout ulcerated region of cecum -- no endoscopic
   treatment of this possible. Other recs -- just supportive therapy.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - Sensitivities added on for coag-neg staph blood culture
   - C. Diff negative
   - IR recs: pt not surgical candidate; if bleeding continues consider
   repeat colonoscopy for endoscopic treatment. If pt unstable, call IR
   for re-eval.
   - Paged GI; says no isolated source of bleeding, just diffuse oozing
   from 20 cm region throughout ulcerated region of cecum -- no endoscopic
   treatment of this possible. Other recs -- just supportive therapy.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC), and prostate cancer who presents to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), hypotension, and anemia. He has received a total of 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) since admission. The patient's GIB is localized to the cecum and has been managed with IR embolization. He has also been diagnosed with leukocytosis and is being treated for possible infectious colitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued GIB: The patient's GIB is ongoing, and further bleeding episodes can occur, leading to hypovolemic shock and potential organ failure.
2. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing infections due to his immunocompromised state, including sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's recent thrombocytopenia may be due to HIT, consumption, lab error/clumping, or other causes, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen due to his GIB, and antihypertensive medications may need to be restarted cautiously.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels may become imbalanced due to his GIB, transfusions, and HD, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's ESRD and recent HD may lead to further kidney damage and potential need for renal replacement therapy.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels may indicate cardiac injury, and further cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, may occur.
8. Respiratory Complications: The patient's GIB and respiratory support may lead to respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
9. Nutritional Complications: The patient's GIB and respiratory support may lead to malnutrition and potential need for enteral nutrition.
10. Psychological Complications: The patient's GIB, hospitalization, and potential for further complications may lead to psychological distress, anxiety, and depression."

   - HD started in afternoon [**3-8**]; got  vanc dose with HD at 10pm
   - Q6h hct - transfused at 5am for 2am Hct of 26; post-transfusion lab
   at 10am was 28.4. Tachy, sbp in 90s, ordered for another unit (7^th
   since [**3-6**] at 6pm) at 4pm-7pm. 4pm Hct = 28.3, 10pm Hct = 26.9
   (post-transfusion). 3:46am Hct = 25.8.
   - Sensitivities added on for coag-neg staph blood culture
   - C. Diff negative
   - IR recs: pt not surgical candidate; if bleeding continues consider
   repeat colonoscopy for endoscopic treatment. If pt unstable, call IR
   for re-eval.
   - Paged GI; says no isolated source of bleeding, just diffuse oozing
   from 20 cm region throughout ulcerated region of cecum -- no endoscopic
   treatment of this possible. Other recs -- just supportive therapy.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, RCC, and prostate cancer who was admitted to the MICU with BRBPR, hematocrit drop, and episode of hypotension. He underwent an IR procedure and has been bleeding continuously, requiring transfusions of 7 units of PRBCs. He has been diagnosed with GI bleed, leukocytosis, and elevated troponin. He also has thrombocytopenia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gout, and dementia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's bleeding is ongoing, and he may require further transfusions and interventions to control it.
2. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture for coag-neg staph and may have infectious colitis, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are being closely monitored, but he may require further interventions to correct imbalances.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and he may be at risk for bleeding complications.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is being closely monitored, and he may require further interventions to control hypertension.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's lipid levels are elevated, and he may require further interventions to control hyperlipidemia.
7. Gout: The patient has a history of gout, and his symptoms may worsen with ongoing bleeding and electrolyte imbalances.
8. Dementia: The patient has a diagnosis of dementia, and his symptoms may worsen with ongoing bleeding and electrolyte imbalances.

Assessment and plan:

The patient will continue to receive supportive therapy, including transfusions, antibiotics, and medications to control bleeding and electrolyte imbalances. He will also be monitored closely for signs of infection, bleeding complications, and organ failure. Further interventions may be necessary to control bleeding, including repeat colonoscopy or endoscopic treatment. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he will be closely monitored for any changes in his condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - HD started in afternoon [**3-8**]; got  vanc dose with HD at 10pm
   - Q6h hct - transfused at 5am for 2am Hct of 26; post-transfusion lab
   at 10am was 28.4. Tachy, sbp in 90s, ordered for another unit (7^th
   since [**3-6**] at 6pm) at 4pm-7pm. 4pm Hct = 28.3, 10pm Hct = 26.9
   (post-transfusion). 3:46am Hct = 30.
   - Sensitivities added on for coag-neg staph blood culture
   - C. Diff negative
   - IR recs: pt not surgical candidate; if bleeding continues consider
   repeat colonoscopy for endoscopic treatment. If pt unstable, call IR
   for re-eval.
   - Paged GI; says no isolated source of bleeding, just diffuse oozing
   from 20 cm region throughout ulcerated region of cecum -- no endoscopic
   treatment of this possible. Other recs -- just supportive therapy.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, RCC, and prostate cancer who presented with BRBPR, hematocrit drop, and hypotension. He was transferred back to the MICU for recurrent BRBPR and hypotension. The patient has undergone an IR procedure for bleeding in the ascending colon and has received a total of 7 units of PRBCs since admission. He is currently on vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for possible colitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient is at risk for continued bleeding in the cecum, which may require further IR intervention or surgical management.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of GPC UTI and may have infectious colitis per CT. Blood cultures are pending, and vancomycin and ciprofloxacin are being used empirically.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has developed thrombocytopenia post-dialysis and PRBC transfusion, which may be related to HIT, consumption, or lab error/clumping.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient is at risk for electrolyte imbalance due to fluid shifts and blood product transfusions.
5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which may worsen in the setting of GIB and require careful blood pressure management.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may be related to infection or inflammation.
7. ESRD on HD: The patient is at risk for complications related to ESRD on HD, including electrolyte imbalance, acidosis, and uremic syndrome.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is at risk for hyperlipidemia, which may require statin therapy.
9. Gout: The patient is at risk for gout, which may require allopurinol therapy.
10. Dementia: The patient has dementia, which may require management with Aricept and risperidone.

ICU Care Plan:

1. Continue vancomycin and ciprofloxacin empirically for possible colitis.
2. Monitor for signs of bleeding and continue serial HCT Q6hr.
3. Trend platelet count and consider HIT, consumption, or lab error/clumping.
4. Replete electrolytes and monitor calcium levels due to blood product transfusions.
5. Manage hypertension carefully in the setting of GIB.
6. Consider starting flagyl if persistent diarrhea despite C diff negative results.
7. Continue phosLo and calcium acetate for ESRD on HD.
8. Monitor for signs of infection and adjust antibiotics as necessary.
9. Consider starting statin for hyperlipidemia.
10. Monitor for signs of gout and consider allopurinol therapy.
11. Continue Aricept and risperidone for dementia.
12. Monitor for signs of worsening renal function and adjust HD schedule as necessary."
