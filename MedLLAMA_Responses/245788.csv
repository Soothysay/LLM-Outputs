You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 86-year-old female admitted to the ICU with urosepsis, hip pain, and hypotension. She has a history of renal cell carcinoma, ovarian cancer, and recurrent urinary tract infections. She is currently receiving antibiotics, vasopressors, and other medications. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.5°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, and blood pressure of 127/41 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 99%. She has a central venous catheter and a presep catheter in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's urosepsis may progress to sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen, leading to further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Heart Failure: The patient's chronic heart failure may worsen, leading to further fluid accumulation and decreased cardiac output.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further hypoxia and hypercapnia.
5. Thromboembolic Complications: The patient's central venous catheter and presep catheter may increase her risk of thromboembolic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
6. Infection: The patient's central venous catheter and presep catheter may increase her risk of infection, such as central line-associated bloodstream infection and catheter-associated urinary tract infection.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's chronic kidney disease and heart failure may increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation, diarrhea, and nausea.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's chronic kidney disease and heart failure may increase her risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, coma, and stroke.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to identify any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent further deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female with a complex medical history, including renal cell carcinoma, ovarian cancer, and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). She was admitted to the ICU with urosepsis and hypotension, and has been treated with antibiotics, fluids, and vasopressors.

The patient's current condition is concerning for several potential medical complications:

1. Urosepsis: The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs and is currently septic with a positive urine culture. She is at risk for further complications, including sepsis, organ failure, and death.
2. Indwelling port and catheter: The patient has an indwelling port and catheter, which increases her risk of infection and bacteremia.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is likely to worsen due to her sepsis and UTI, and she may require dialysis.
4. Heart failure and severe aortic stenosis: The patient has moderate to severe aortic stenosis and is likely preload-dependent, which increases her risk of cardiac complications.
5. Gout: The patient has a history of gout and is currently being treated with allopurinol, which may not be effective in managing her current symptoms.
6. Ovarian cancer and renal cell carcinoma: The patient has a history of ovarian cancer and renal cell carcinoma, which may have contributed to her current condition.
7. Left hip pain: The patient has left hip pain, which may be related to her UTI, sepsis, or indwelling hip hardware.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving 2L of nasal cannula oxygen and has a SpO2 of 99%, which may indicate respiratory failure.
9. Nausea and vomiting: The patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting, which may be related to her antibiotics, sepsis, or other underlying conditions.

Based on this assessment, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical conditions. She should be treated with antibiotics, fluids, and vasopressors to manage her urosepsis and sepsis. Her indwelling port and catheter should be removed as soon as possible to reduce her risk of infection. She should also be closely monitored for signs of organ failure, including cardiac, respiratory, and renal failure."

   Assessment and Plan
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   - Continue Zosyn, add additional gram negative coverage (will d/w ID)
   - Follow up culture data
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): Likely GU source, but
   portacath and hip are also very possible sources.
   If worsening, increased pressor needs consider porta cath removal
    Currently on Levophed, clinically requires additional fluid challenge.
   - Broaden GNR coverage (as above), also add Vanco for gram positives.
   - Place A-line for hemodynamic monitoring
   - Will consider further imaging of hip when stable for MRI or CT,
   concern for infection or pathologic fx given pain
   - Consider dobutamine if SVO2 remains low
recheck after additional IVF
   boluses
   * Afib: new, likely related to acute illness, levophed
   - Attempt to wean levophed
   - Hold off on anticoag for now
   - Obtain 12-lead EKG
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   * Nausea/vomiting: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to dilaudid, ruling out cardiac
   etiology
   - Zofran PRN
   - Cycle enzymes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) who presented to the Emergency Department with hip pain and was found to be in shock. She has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is being treated with Zosyn. The patient is also experiencing oliguria, and her renal ultrasound is pending.

The patient has a portacath and presep catheter, which were inserted on January 16, 2163, at 7:04 PM and 7:05 PM, respectively. She is receiving Levophed and is being monitored for sepsis. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation, which is likely related to her acute illness and Levophed use.

The patient's laboratory results show that she has a white blood cell count of 20.6, hemoglobin of 30, and platelet count of 83. Her creatinine level is 2.4 mg/dL, and her troponin-T level is 0.12. Her lactate level is 1.1 mmol/L, and her LDH level is 145 IU/L.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a urinary tract infection, and her sepsis is likely related to the infection. She is at risk for further complications, including organ dysfunction and death.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is likely related to her acute illness and Levophed use. She is at risk for further complications, including stroke and cardiac arrest.
3. Oliguria: The patient is experiencing oliguria, which is a risk factor for acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
4. Nausea and vomiting: The patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting, which may be related to her medication use or underlying illness.
5. Cancer: The patient has a history of renal cell carcinoma, which is a risk factor for further complications, including metastasis and death.

Based on the patient's condition, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Further sepsis: The patient's sepsis can worsen, leading to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can worsen, leading to stroke and cardiac arrest.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's oliguria can worsen, leading to acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
4. Cancer progression: The patient's renal cell carcinoma can progress, leading to metastasis and death.
5. Infection: The patient's portacath and presep catheter can become infected, leading to further complications.

The patient requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent and manage these potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented to the emergency department (ED) with hip pain and was found to be in shock. She was diagnosed with urosepsis and has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management. The patient has been receiving Zosyn antibiotics and Levophed vasopressors to manage her septic shock. She has also been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and is experiencing nausea and vomiting.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock can lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and respiratory failure.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation can increase her risk of stroke, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition.
4. Cancer progression: The patient's underlying RCC can progress and spread to other parts of the body, leading to further complications.
5. Portacath-related complications: The patient's indwelling portacath can lead to infection, bleeding, or occlusion.
6. Urinary tract infection: The patient's UTI can spread to the kidneys and other parts of the urinary tract, leading to further complications.
7. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's fluid loss due to diarrhea, vomiting, or bleeding can lead to hypovolemic shock.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can lead to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and fluid status to prevent these potential complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old female with a complex medical history, currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, cardio-genic shock, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and a urinary tract infection.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 94/40 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is receiving norepinephrine infusion to maintain blood pressure.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 20.6-33.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.9-32.9 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 83-114 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 2.3-2.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.11-0.12 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.1 mmol/L
* LDH: 145 IU/L
* Calcium (Ca++): 8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus (PO4): 6.0 mg/dL

The patient has a PortaCath, presep catheter, and arterial line in place. She is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and pain management medications.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver failure, or respiratory failure.
2. Cardio-genic shock, which may lead to cardiac arrest or cardiac tamponade.
3. Atrial fibrillation, which may increase the risk of stroke or thromboembolic events.
4. Urinary tract infection, which may lead to sepsis or kidney damage.
5. Cancer-related complications, such as metastasis or organ dysfunction.
6. Pain control issues, which may lead to inadequate pain management or opioid-related complications.
7. Nutritional deficiencies, particularly in the context of prolonged NPO status.
8. Potential for bleeding complications due to anticoagulant therapy.
9. Increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to immobility and presence of indwelling lines.

It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition closely to identify any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent adverse outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   86 y/o F with PMHx of severe AS with EF of 45%, Renal Cell Ca and
   Ovarian Ca who presented with L hip pain and presumed urosepsis,
   clinical status deteriorated this afternoon with oliguria & acidosis,
   increased pressor requirement & MS changes.  Pt was intubated and ABG
   improving on vent.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): Pt presented with positive
   UA, hypotension and presumed urosepsis, but was covered with Vanc/Zosyn
   for 48hrs unable to wean from pressors.  WBC ct rising, worsening
   acidosis and developped Afib with RVR & hypotension requiring addl
   pressors.  Pt was bolused 2.5L and converted, but MS deteriorated & pt
   was intubated for airway protection and acidosis. Post intubation, pt
   was able to wean from pressors. ABG 7.29/38/252
   - will [**Month (only) 38**] FiO2 and repeat ABG
   - apprec ID consult, will monitor BPs overnight, if clinically
   deteriorates, will broaden coverage to Meropenem/Vanc
   - bolus IVF prn, no pressor requirement currently
   - follow CT chest/abd/pelv read, ruling out abscess, septic joint or
   infected hardware
   - consider d/c portocath in am
   - f/u blood & urine cultures, Urine +pseudomonas
sensitivities pending
 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC: Pt developped Afib with RVR and became
   hypotensive.  Responded to fluid boluses, then post-intubation, all
   pressors weaned and BP stable.  Pt was loaded with digoxin
   - f/u am digoxin level on [**1-20**]
   - fluid bolus prn A.fib & consider amiodarone vs cardioversion if
   uncontrolled RVR
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Apprec renal consult
   for pt with oliguric renal failure likely due to ATN but urine sediment
   revealed sheets of WBCs,  unable to further assess sediment.
   - currently oliguric and extravascularly volume overloaded
   - resp status stable on vent, no acute indication for dialysis
   - renally dose meds, starting phoslo & monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]
 AORTIC STENOSIS: AS with valve area 0.7cm, very preload dependant,
   bolus fluid prn and avoid BB/CCBs.
   - continue digoxin, monitor for worsening CHF
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): presumed source of sepsis, currently
   in oliguric RF, foley in place
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn for coverage of pseudomonas species, waiting on
   sensitivities
LEFT HIP PAIN: unknown etiology, concern for fluid collection/septic
   joint.  Apprec ortho consult
   - f/u CT pelvis and continue Vanc/Zosyn.  Intubated with fentanyl for
   sedation & pain control.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   UA, hypotension and presumed urosepsis, but was covered with Vanc/Zosyn
   for 48hrs unable to wean from pressors.  WBC ct rising, worsening
   acidosis and developped Afib with RVR & hypotension requiring addl
   pressors.  Pt was bolused 2.5L and converted, but MS deteriorated & pt
   was intubated for airway protection and acidosis. Post intubation, pt
   was able to wean from pressors. ABG 7.29/38/252
   - will [**Month (only) 38**] FiO2 and repeat ABG
   - apprec ID consult, will monitor BPs overnight, if clinically
   deteriorates, will broaden coverage to Meropenem/Vanc
   - bolus IVF prn, no pressor requirement currently
   - follow CT chest/abd/pelv read, ruling out abscess, septic joint or
   infected hardware
   - consider d/c portocath in am

sensitivities pending
 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC: Pt developped Afib with RVR and became
   hypotensive.  Responded to fluid boluses, then post-intubation, all
   pressors weaned and BP stable.  Pt was loaded with digoxin
   - f/u am digoxin level on [**1-20**]
   - fluid bolus prn A.fib & consider amiodarone vs cardioversion if
   uncontrolled RVR
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Apprec renal consult
   for pt with oliguric renal failure likely due to ATN but urine sediment
   revealed sheets of WBCs,  unable to further assess sediment.
   - currently oliguric and extravascularly volume overloaded
   - resp status stable on vent, no acute indication for dialysis
   - renally dose meds, starting phoslo & monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]
 AORTIC STENOSIS: AS with valve area 0.7cm, very preload dependant,
   bolus fluid prn and avoid BB/CCBs.
   - continue digoxin, monitor for worsening CHF
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): presumed source of sepsis, currently
   in oliguric RF, foley in place

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, renal cell carcinoma, and ovarian cancer, who presented with left hip pain and presumed urosepsis. The patient's clinical status deteriorated, leading to oliguria, acidosis, and increased pressor requirement.

The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and became hypotensive, requiring additional pressors. She was bolused with 2.5L and converted to sinus rhythm, but her cardiac status continued to deteriorate. The patient was intubated for airway protection and acidosis.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient's clinical status deteriorated due to presumed urosepsis, and she developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, and increased pressor requirement.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and became hypotensive, requiring additional pressors.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient is oliguric and has a rising WBC count, which may indicate worsening renal function.
4. Urinary tract infection: The patient has a Foley catheter in place and is receiving antibiotics for a presumed UTI.
5. Aortic stenosis: The patient has a history of severe aortic stenosis, which may be contributing to her cardiogenic shock and acute renal failure.
6. Left hip pain: The patient has unknown etiology left hip pain, which may be related to a fluid collection or septic joint.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which may be complicated by respiratory failure.
8. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be contributing to her cardiogenic shock and acute renal failure.
9. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may be contributing to her cardiac and renal dysfunction.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving antibiotics for a presumed UTI and sepsis.
2. Fluid management: The patient is receiving fluid boluses as needed to manage her hypotension and acidosis.
3. Cardiac management: The patient is receiving digoxin to manage her atrial fibrillation and is being monitored for worsening CHF.
4. Renal management: The patient is being monitored for worsening renal function and is receiving phoslo to manage her electrolyte levels.
5. Respiratory management: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and is being monitored for respiratory failure.
6. Left hip pain management: The patient is being monitored for worsening left hip pain and is receiving antibiotics for a presumed UTI.
7. Aortic stenosis management: The patient is being managed with digoxin and is being monitored for worsening CHF.

Overall, the patient's clinical status is unstable, and she requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): GU likely source, but
   continued elevated WBC and pressor requirement despite broad spectrum
   abx suggest either inadequate coverage of Pseudomonas, or other source
   such as infected hip, c. diff, line infection (portacath), acalculous
   cholecystitis, etc. though she has a benign abd exam and negative
   cultures from her indwelling line.
   - Send repeat cultures
   - Check LFTs
   - CT chest (eval for loculated effusions/empyema as possible source,
   though low suspicion, may have seeded)  and CT hip
   - Redose vanco according to levels
   - Consult ID re: antibiotic coverage/double coverage of pseudomonas
     Recheck abg for Ph/CO2 and lactate
 SHOCK, SEPTIC/CARDIOGENIC: Continues pressor needs, with slow
   escalation. SVO2 is adequate. AS complicates management and assessment
   of volume/cvp
   - Continue fluid boluses and vasopressor with goal to taper off as BP
   allows, carefully monitor oxygen/resp status
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): essentially
   anuric--Likely ATN, though creatinine also increasing slowly.
   - Continue fluid boluses to keep preload elevated, monitor lytes
   - Consult renal
no acute HD needs
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Well rate controlled at present
 AORTIC STENOSIS: Continue boluses.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Pseudomonas, awaiting sensitivities.
   Renal U/S without perinephric abscess or Hydro
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Showing signs of delirium on
   dilaudid, but she has multiple allergies.
   - Will continue dilaudid at low dose.
   - Add lidocaine patch, standing tylenol
   * DELERIUM: Related to age, ICU, meds.
   - Will begin haldol at low dose
   - Attempt to orient, minimize psychotropic meds.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): GU likely source, but
   continued elevated WBC and pressor requirement despite broad spectrum
   abx suggest either inadequate coverage of Pseudomonas, or other source
   such as infected hip, c. diff, line infection (portacath), acalculous
   cholecystitis, etc. though she has a benign abd exam and negative
   cultures from her indwelling line.
   - Send repeat cultures
   - Check LFTs
   - CT chest (eval for loculated effusions/empyema as possible source,
   though low suspicion, may have seeded)  and CT hip
   - Redose vanco according to levels
   - Consult ID re: antibiotic coverage/double coverage of pseudomonas
     Recheck abg for Ph/CO2 and lactate
 SHOCK, SEPTIC/CARDIOGENIC: Continues pressor needs, with slow
   escalation. SVO2 is adequate. AS complicates management and assessment
   of volume/cvp
   - Continue fluid boluses and vasopressor with goal to taper off as BP
   allows, carefully monitor oxygen/resp status
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): essentially
   anuric--Likely ATN, though creatinine also increasing slowly.
   - Continue fluid boluses to keep preload elevated, monitor lytes
   - Consult renal
no acute HD needs
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Well rate controlled at present
 AORTIC STENOSIS: Continue boluses.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Pseudomonas, awaiting sensitivities.
   Renal U/S without perinephric abscess or Hydro
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Showing signs of delirium on
   dilaudid, but she has multiple allergies.
   - Will continue dilaudid at low dose.
   - Add lidocaine patch, standing tylenol
   * DELERIUM: Related to age, ICU, meds.
   - Will begin haldol at low dose
   - Attempt to orient, minimize psychotropic meds.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient, an 86-year-old female, is critically ill with severe aortic stenosis and urosepsis, likely caused by Pseudomonas. She is experiencing persistent vasopressor requirements, leukocytosis, and anuric acute renal failure. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 109/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She has atrial fibrillation, and her electrocardiogram (EKG) shows no ischemic changes.

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* WBC: 20.6-28.6 K/uL
* Hct: 30-32.9%
* Plt: 83-114 K/uL
* Cr: 2.3-2.9 mg/dL
* Trop-T: 0.11-0.12 ng/mL
* Glucose: 74-147 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 15.0/32.1/1.3, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 39/8/0.11, Differential-Neuts: 91.2%, Band: 0.0%, Lymph: 4.2%, Mono: 4.5%, Eos: 0.1%, Lactic Acid: 1.1 mmol/L, LDH: 145 IU/L, Ca++: 8.1 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 6.0 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* R>L pleural effusion with slight increase from the previous day
* Possible bibasilar opacities

The patient's medical complications and potential medical complications are:

1. Sepsis, severe, with organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated WBC count and pressor requirement suggest either inadequate coverage of Pseudomonas or another source of infection, such as an infected hip, C. diff, line infection, or acalculous cholecystitis.
2. Shock, septic/cardiogenic: The patient's persistent pressor needs and slow escalation of vasopressors suggest septic shock, which is complicated by her aortic stenosis.
3. Renal failure, acute: The patient's anuric acute renal failure is likely caused by acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and her creatinine level is increasing slowly.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is well-controlled at present.
5. Pain control: The patient is experiencing delirium, which is related to her age, ICU stay, and medications.
6. Delirium: The patient's delirium is likely caused by her age, ICU stay, and medications, and will be treated with low-dose haloperidol.
7. Cancer, gynecological: The patient has a history of ovarian cancer.
8. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a UTI caused by Pseudomonas, and is awaiting sensitivities.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Repeat cultures
2. Check LFTs
3. CT chest and CT hip
4. Redose vancomycin according to levels
5. Consult ID regarding antibiotic coverage/double coverage of Pseudomonas
6. Continue fluid boluses and vasopressor with goal to taper off as blood pressure allows
7. Monitor oxygen/resp status
8. Consult renal regarding acute renal failure
9. Continue pain management with low-dose dilaudid and lidocaine patch
10. Add haloperidol for delirium
11. Begin glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale
12. Continue prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): GU likely source, but
   continued elevated WBC and pressor requirement despite broad spectrum
   abx suggest either inadequate coverage of Pseudomonas, or other source
   such as infected hip, c. diff, line infection, cholecystitis, etc.
   though she has a benign abd exam and negative cultures from her
   indwelling line.
   - Will get repeat cultures
   - Check LFTs
   - CT chest and CT hip
   - Redose vanco according to levels
   - Consult ID re: antibiotic coverage
 SHOCK, SEPTIC/CARDIOGENIC: Continues to need pressors, with slow
   escalation. SVO2 is adequate. AS complicates management.
   - Continue fluid boluses and vasopressor
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Likely ATN, though
   creatinine also increasing slowly.
   - Continue fluid boluses to keep preload elevated, monitor lytes
   - Consult renal
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Well rate controlled
 AORTIC STENOSIS: Continue boluses.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Pseudomonas, awaiting sensitivities.
   Renal U/S without perinephric abscess or Hydro
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Showing signs of delerium on

   - Will continue dilaudid at low dose.
   - Add lidocaine patch, standing tylenol
   * DELERIUM: Related to age, ICU, meds.
   - Will begin haldol at low dose
   - Attempt to orient, minimize psychotropic meds.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with urosepsis, atrial fibrillation, and septic shock. The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management.

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* Elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and neutrophil count, suggesting infection
* Elevated creatinine levels, indicating acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Elevated lactate levels, indicating tissue hypoxia
* Elevated troponin levels, indicating possible cardiac injury
* Elevated liver enzymes, indicating possible liver dysfunction

The patient's imaging studies indicate:

* A right greater than left pleural effusion, suggesting possible pneumonia or pleurisy
* Possible bibasilar opacities on chest X-ray, suggesting possible pneumonia

The patient's medical history is significant for:

* Urosepsis, likely caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa
* Aortic stenosis, which may be contributing to the patient's cardiac dysfunction
* Cancer, specifically ovarian, uterine, cervical, or endometrial cancer
* Pain, specifically hip pain, which may be related to the patient's underlying medical condition

The patient's current medications include:

* Levophed, a vasopressor, to support blood pressure
* Norepinephrine, another vasopressor, to support blood pressure
* Hydromorphone, a pain medication, which may be contributing to the patient's delirium
* Famotidine, an antacid, to manage gastric acid reflux
* Allopurinol, a medication to manage gout
* SQ heparin, an anticoagulant, to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT)

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Sepsis, which may worsen the patient's condition
* Acute kidney injury (AKI), which may require dialysis
* Cardiac dysfunction, which may require further cardiac evaluation
* Delirium, which may require further management with antipsychotic medications
* Pneumonia, which may require antibiotic treatment
* Pleurisy, which may require further evaluation and treatment

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Repeat cultures to determine the source of the infection
* Check liver function tests (LFTs) to monitor liver dysfunction
* CT chest and CT hip to evaluate for possible pneumonia or pleurisy
* Redose vancomycin according to levels to manage the infection
* Consult with an infectious disease specialist to determine the best antibiotic coverage
* Continue fluid boluses and vasopressors to support blood pressure
* Monitor the patient's electrolytes and renal function
* Consult with a renal specialist to evaluate the patient's AKI
* Continue pain management with hydromorphone and consider adding lidocaine patch and standing tylenol
* Begin haldol at low dose to manage delirium
* Attempt to orient the patient and minimize psychotropic medications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis, cardiogenic shock, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis. She is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. Her laboratory results show evidence of a urinary tract infection (UTI) and pseudomonas pan-sensitive urine culture. She has also tested positive for cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the gynecological origin.

The patient's physical examination reveals a soft abdomen, no rebound tenderness, and bilateral 2+ pitting edema. Her vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98°F)
* Heart rate: 73 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 103/36 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 9 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* SpO2: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 28.6
* Hematocrit: 32.9
* Platelet count: 114
* Creatinine: 2.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 19 mg/dL
* Serum glucose: 88 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium 137 mmol/L, potassium 3.5 mmol/L, chloride 25.1 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 12.7 mmol/L

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: no evidence of loculated pleural effusion or empyema, but new opacification at the right lung base and posterior segment of the right upper lobe, concerning for pneumonia, possibly related to aspiration.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury and respiratory failure.
2. Cardiogenic shock, which can lead to cardiac arrest if not managed promptly.
3. Atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of stroke and heart failure.
4. Acute renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis if not managed promptly.
5. Pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.
6. Cancer progression, which can lead to further complications and decreased quality of life.
7. Urinary tract infection, which can lead to sepsis and kidney damage if not managed promptly.
8. Aortic stenosis, which can lead to cardiac failure and decreased cardiac output if not managed promptly.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities and complications. It is essential to manage her sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and acute renal failure promptly and aggressively to prevent further complications and improve her chances of survival."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Communication:  Comments:
   Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate)
   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and chronic heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 45%. She was admitted for presumed urosepsis and was intubated due to worsening acidosis, oliguric renal failure, and hemodynamic instability. The patient has a central line, arterial line, and a PortaCath.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 450 mL.
* Cardiovascular: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, controlled with digoxin. Blood pressure is 103/36 mmHg.
* Renal: Oliguric renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.9 mg/dL. Urine output is 105 mL over the past 24 hours.
* Infection: Presumed source of infection is urosepsis, with a positive urine culture growing out pan-sensitive Pseudomonas.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC count 28.6, hemoglobin 8.1 g/dL, platelet count 114,000.
	+ Blood chemistry: sodium 137 mEq/L, potassium 4.7 mg/dL, glucose 88 mg/dL, creatinine 2.9 mg/dL.
	+ Urine culture: pan-sensitive Pseudomonas.
	+ Arterial blood gas (ABG): pH 7.35, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) 35 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) 119 mmHg.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac function is compromised due to severe AS and CHF. The development of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may further compromise cardiac function.
2. Renal failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure may progress to acute renal failure (ARF) if not managed appropriately.
3. Sepsis: The patient's urosepsis may lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Pseudomonas infection: The patient's positive urine culture growing out pan-sensitive Pseudomonas may lead to a more severe infection if not managed appropriately.
5. Catheter-related complications: The patient's central line, arterial line, and PortaCath may be associated with complications such as catheter-related bloodstream infection, catheter-related thrombosis, or catheter-related sepsis.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 103/36 mmHg, which may be a concern, especially given her cardiac compromise.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is 88 mg/dL, which may indicate hyperglycemia, especially given her cardiac compromise.
8. Acidosis: The patient's pH is 7.35, which may indicate acidosis, especially given her respiratory and metabolic derangements.
9. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.7 mg/dL and a sodium level of 137 mEq/L.
10. Infection control: The patient's central line, arterial line, and PortaCath may require careful management to prevent infection.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, it is recommended to:

1. Continue to manage the patient's urosepsis with antibiotics and close monitoring.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent cardiogenic shock.
3. Continue to manage the patient's renal failure with close monitoring and adjustments to fluid and electrolyte therapy as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings as necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalance.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's glucose level and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent hyperglycemia.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's acid-base status and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent acidosis.
8. Consider adjusting the patient's antibiotic therapy based on the results of the urine culture.
9. Consider adjusting the patient's fluid and electrolyte therapy based on the results of the urine culture.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent further complications."

   Blood Cx NGTD
   C. Diff negative
   Assessment and Plan : 86 y/o F with PMHx of severe AS & CHF with EF
   45%, renal cell & ovarian Ca p/w Left hip pain, adm for presumed
   urosepsis on pressors.  Intubated on [**1-18**] for worsening acidosis,
   oliguric renal failure, hemodynamic instability [**12-25**] to Afib with RVR
   and MS changes.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): Source of infection presumed
   to be urosepsis with positive UA growing out pan sensitive
   Pseudomonas.  Pt was covered with Vanc/Zosyn for 48hr but clinically
   deteriorated yesterday possibly due to incomplete volume resuscitation.
   Pt was intubated and weaned for pressors, WBC ct now trending down and
   acidosis resolving on vent.  [**Month/Day (2) 1212**] ID consult, continue ruling out
   other sources of infection.  Will check C. diff X 3 given new diarrhea.
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn for coverage of pseudomonas in urine
   - [**Month/Day (2) **] ortho consult for L  hip pain and concern for seeding of
   hardware.  F/u recs
   - will d/w rads regarding CT chest/abd/pelvis
   - L upper chest wall u/s to rule out abscess near portocath
   - continue to f/u blood & urine cultures
   - bolus prn to maintain Maps>65
 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC: Pt with severe AS & CHF with EF 45% developed
   Afib with RVR and became hypotensive on [**1-18**]. Pressure responded to IVF
   & pressors.  Pt was then Intubated and pressors weaned. Pt still in/out
   of Afib but HR has been much better controlled on digoxin.
   - check am digoxin level on [**1-20**]
   - avoid CCB/BBs
   - no plan for systemic anticoagulation currently given the [**Month (only) 38**] plt
   count, will re-consider in am if plts stable
   - fluid bolus prn to maintain maps>60
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Pt with oliguric
   renal failure likely [**12-25**] ATN but urine sediment showed sheets of WBCs.
   Creatinine appears to have plateaued and pt having some UOP overnight.
   [**Month/Day (2) 1212**] Renal recs, there is no acute indication for dialysis.  Uremia
   likely contributing to acidosis, currently compensated with vent
   support
   - avoid continuous IVF given poor UOP
   - f/u urine sediment, renally dose meds, check C3/4 & urine eos per
   Renal
   - continue phoslo TID & check lytes [**Hospital1 **]
 AORTIC STENOSIS: AS with valve area of 0.7cm, very preload
   dependant.  Gentle bolus IVF prn to maintain MAP>60
   - continue digoxin, monitor daily CXR & resp status to avoid massive
   volume overload.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): presumed source of infection with UA +
   pseudomonas, pan sensitive
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn for coverage
 LEFT HIP PAIN: Etiology unclear, [**Name2 (NI) **] ortho recs.  Exam did not
   suggest a septic joint on admission, clearly very painful on
   manipulation, will discuss final CT read with rads

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS), chronic heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 45%, and renal cell and ovarian cancer. She was admitted for presumed urosepsis and was intubated due to worsening acidosis, oliguric renal failure, and hemodynamic instability.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiac status: The patient has atrial fibrillation (Afib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and mitral regurgitation (MR). She was loaded with digoxin to control her heart rate.
* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. Her respiratory status is stable, with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%.
* Renal status: The patient has oliguric renal failure, and her creatinine level has plateaued. She is producing some urine overnight, but her urine output is still limited.
* Hemodynamic status: The patient's blood pressure is stable, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 103 mmHg. She is receiving fluids and pressors to maintain her blood pressure.
* Infectious status: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by pan-sensitive Pseudomonas, which is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.
* Other medical conditions: The patient has a history of severe AS, CHF, and renal cell and ovarian cancer. She also has a left hip pain that is being evaluated by orthopedics.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's Afib with RVR and MR can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's intubation and invasive ventilation can lead to respiratory failure, pneumonia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Renal complications: The patient's oliguric renal failure can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
4. Hemodynamic complications: The patient's hypotension can lead to organ dysfunction, including cardiac, renal, and hepatic failure.
5. Infectious complications: The patient's UTI can lead to sepsis, septic shock, and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
6. Thrombotic complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia can lead to bleeding complications, including hemorrhagic shock.
7. Metabolic complications: The patient's hyperglycemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome (HHNS), and electrolyte imbalances.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with severe AS, h/o renal cell and ovarian ca in ICU for
   urosepsis with Afib/RVR, hypotension, ARF and delirium, intubated for
   worsening acidosis and airway protection
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)- pseudomonas urosepsis also
   likely with asp pna
        improving --off pressors after  additional fluid resuscitation,
   wbc trending down
          L hip pain remains problem[**Name (NI) 1114**] though no obvious fluid
   collection on imaging, has significant  pain with touch,/motion
                 ?septic bursitis, ortho following and await additonal

         Given no gram positives in blood and current clinical
   improvement, lower suspicion of seeded portacath
will check u/s for
   fluid collection
         Continue zosyn and  f/u cx results
 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC--cardiogenic in setting of a-fib with RVR and
   hypotension, now rate controlled
   BP improved and  stable off of pressors, cvp difficult to follow given
   severe AS, lactates normalized
        Treating underlying infection as above

f/u on cx
   for GPs, check ultrasound of line
             zosyn for pseudomonas
             clinically improving and highest suspicion is of urosepsis
   >  thrombocytopenia--on review of records baseline thrombocytopenia in
   50-70 range, with initial elevation here likely from hemoconcentration,
   dic labs negative and HUS/TTP unlikely, check smear, component of
   hemodilution likely with aggressive fluids and now at baseline--follow
   for further reduction from baseline, continue heparin products for now
   given low suspicion for HIT
       anemia-  follow, likely hemodilution, transfuse for < 21 or
   active bleed or if hypotension
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)--now rate controlled, on dig, responsive
   to IVFs but would avoid calcium channel blockers in setting of RVR
   given severe AS,
        Would not anticoagulate at this time given new drop in hct and
   plts (suspect hemodilution)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has urosepsis, which can lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and even death.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of respiratory failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has cardiogenic shock due to a-fib with RVR and hypotension, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has ARF due to sepsis and hypotension, which can lead to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
7. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has AFib, which can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
8. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis, which can increase the risk of heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and death.
9. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a UTI, which can lead to sepsis, kidney damage, and chronic kidney disease.
10. Cancer: The patient has a history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, which can lead to metastatic disease and death.

To address these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their condition. This includes:

1. Sepsis management: The patient requires aggressive management of their sepsis, including administration of antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and support of organ function.
2. Respiratory care: The patient requires close monitoring of their respiratory status and management of their mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiovascular management: The patient requires management of their cardiogenic shock, including administration of inotropes and vasopressors.
4. Renal management: The patient requires management of their ARF, including administration of diuretics and support of renal function.
5. Hematological management: The patient requires management of their thrombocytopenia and anemia, including administration of platelet transfusions and blood transfusions.
6. Cardiac management: The patient requires management of their AFib, including administration of anticoagulants and antiarrhythmic medications.
7. Aortic stenosis management: The patient requires management of their aortic stenosis, including administration of medications to reduce symptoms and prevent complications.
8. UTI management: The patient requires management of their UTI, including administration of antibiotics and support of kidney function.
9. Cancer management: The patient requires management of their cancer, including administration of chemotherapy and support of organ function.

Overall, the patient requires a multidisciplinary approach to management, including input from intensivists, cardiologists, nephrologists, hematologists, and oncologists."

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): GU likely source, but
   continued elevated WBC and pressor requirement despite broad spectrum
   abx suggest either inadequate coverage of Pseudomonas, or other source
   such as infected hip, c. diff, line infection (portacath), acalculous
   cholecystitis, etc. though she has a benign abd exam and negative
   cultures from her indwelling line.
   - Send repeat cultures
   - Check LFTs
   - CT chest (eval for loculated effusions/empyema as possible source,
   though low suspicion, may have seeded)  and CT hip

 SHOCK, SEPTIC/CARDIOGENIC: Continues pressor needs, with slow
   escalation. SVO2 is adequate. AS complicates management and assessment
   of volume/cvp
   - Continue fluid boluses and vasopressor with goal to taper off as BP
   allows, carefully monitor oxygen/resp status
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): essentially
   anuric--Likely ATN, though creatinine also increasing slowly.
   - Continue fluid boluses to keep preload elevated, monitor lytes
   - Consult renal
no acute HD needs
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Well rate controlled at present
 AORTIC STENOSIS: Continue boluses.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Pseudomonas, awaiting sensitivities.
   Renal U/S without perinephric abscess or Hydro
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Showing signs of delirium on
   dilaudid, but she has multiple allergies.
   - Will continue dilaudid at low dose.
   - Add lidocaine patch, standing tylenol
   * DELERIUM: Related to age, ICU, meds.
   - Will begin haldol at low dose
   - Attempt to orient, minimize psychotropic meds.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)- psuedomonal urospesis also
   likely with asp pna--improving --off pressors with additional fluid
   resuscitation, wbc trending down
      L hip pain remains problem[**Name (NI) 1114**] though no obvious fluid collection on
   imaging, pain with touch, motion on exam--? septic brusitis, ortho
   following and await additonal recs
     continue zosynm f/u cx's
 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC--cardiogenic in setting of afib with RVR and
   hypotension, now rate controlled
   BP improved, sdtable and off of pressors, cvp difficult to follow given
   severe AS, lactates normalized
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   renal follwoing, atn from sepsis hypotension, cr seems to have peaked,
   phos binder started, all meds renally dosed
   thrombocytopenia--on review of records baseline thromnbocytopenia in
   50-70 range, with intial elevation here likely from hemoconcentration,
   dic labs negative and HUS/TTP unlikely, check smear, component of
   hemoconcetration likely though HIT possibiloty but given that plt is
   now at baseline--follow for further reduction from baseline, continue
   heparin products for now given low suspicion for HIT
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)--now rate controlled, on dig, limited
   given her severe af, respnsive to IVFs but would avoid calcium channel
   blockers,  given new drop in hct and plts
     Leukocytosis--improving toward normal, check dc diff, continue vacno
   X 24 more hrs given catheter, clinically improving and highest
   suspicion is of urosepsis, though with line in plae would check
   ultrasound of porta cath and await new cx gram stain and result to show
   no GPs

 URINE CULTURE - At [**2163-1-18**] 03:39 PM
   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): GU likely source, but
   continued elevated WBC and pressor requirement despite broad spectrum
   abx suggest either inadequate coverage of Pseudomonas, or other source
   such as infected hip, c. diff, line infection (portacath), acalculous
   cholecystitis, etc. though she has a benign abd exam and negative
   cultures from her indwelling line.
   - Send repeat cultures
   - Check LFTs
   - CT chest (eval for loculated effusions/empyema as possible source,
   though low suspicion, may have seeded)  and CT hip

 SHOCK, SEPTIC/CARDIOGENIC: Continues pressor needs, with slow
   escalation. SVO2 is adequate. AS complicates management and assessment
   of volume/cvp
   - Continue fluid boluses and vasopressor with goal to taper off as BP
   allows, carefully monitor oxygen/resp status
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): essentially
   anuric--Likely ATN, though creatinine also increasing slowly.
   - Continue fluid boluses to keep preload elevated, monitor lytes
   - Consult renal
no acute HD needs
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Well rate controlled at present
 AORTIC STENOSIS: Continue boluses.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Pseudomonas, awaiting sensitivities.
   Renal U/S without perinephric abscess or Hydro
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Showing signs of delirium on
   dilaudid, but she has multiple allergies.
   - Will continue dilaudid at low dose.
   - Add lidocaine patch, standing tylenol
   * DELERIUM: Related to age, ICU, meds.
   - Will begin haldol at low dose
   - Attempt to orient, minimize psychotropic meds.

   Disposition :
   Total time spent: 40 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications are potential concerns:

1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis with organ dysfunction, which is a life-threatening condition. The patient's WBC count is trending down, but the sepsis is not fully controlled.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has cardiogenic shock due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypotension. The patient's blood pressure is improving, but the condition is still unstable.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely caused by sepsis and hypotension. The patient's creatinine level is increasing slowly, and the patient is essentially anuric.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is likely caused by hemoconcentration and possibly HIT. The patient's platelet count is trending down, and the patient is at risk for bleeding.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is improving towards normal. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an ongoing infection.
6. Delirium: The patient has delirium, which is likely caused by the patient's age, ICU stay, and medications. The patient is at risk for falls, skin breakdown, and other complications.
7. Pain: The patient has L hip pain, which is likely caused by an infected hip or other source. The patient is at risk for further complications if the pain is not adequately managed.
8. Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Pseudomonas, which is resistant to many antibiotics. The patient is at risk for further infections if the UTI is not adequately treated.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Continue zosyn for UTI
* Send repeat cultures
* Check LFTs
* CT chest and CT hip to evaluate for loculated effusions/empyema and other potential sources of sepsis
* Continue fluid boluses and vasopressor to manage shock
* Consult renal for management of acute renal failure
* Continue pain management with fentanyl and lidocaine patch
* Begin haldol for delirium
* Attempt to orient the patient and minimize psychotropic medications.

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: begin TF's via OG tube
* Glycemic control: regular insulin sliding scale
* Lines: indwelling port, presep catheter, and arterial line
* Prophylaxis: DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* Communication: ICU consent signed and family updated
* Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate)
* Disposition: the patient is critically ill and requires continued ICU care."

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): GU likely source, but
   continued elevated WBC and pressor requirement despite broad spectrum
   abx suggest either inadequate coverage of Pseudomonas, or other source
   such as infected hip, c. diff, line infection (portacath), acalculous
   cholecystitis, etc. though she has a benign abd exam and negative
   cultures from her indwelling line.
   - Send repeat cultures
   - Check LFTs
   - CT chest (eval for loculated effusions/empyema as possible source,
   though low suspicion, may have seeded)  and CT hip

 SHOCK, SEPTIC/CARDIOGENIC: Continues pressor needs, with slow
   escalation. SVO2 is adequate. AS complicates management and assessment
   of volume/cvp
   - Continue fluid boluses and vasopressor with goal to taper off as BP
   allows, carefully monitor oxygen/resp status
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): essentially
   anuric--Likely ATN, though creatinine also increasing slowly.
   - Continue fluid boluses to keep preload elevated, monitor lytes
   - Consult renal
no acute HD needs
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Well rate controlled at present
 AORTIC STENOSIS: Continue boluses.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Pseudomonas, awaiting sensitivities.

   - Will continue dilaudid at low dose.
   - Add lidocaine patch, standing tylenol

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, and currently in the ICU due to urosepsis, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 450 mL. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 101/36 mmHg. She has a central venous catheter, arterial line, and indwelling portacath, and is receiving antibiotics for pseudomonas urosepsis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is severe, with a high likelihood of organ dysfunction. She is at risk for further deterioration and may require additional support, such as vasopressors and mechanical ventilation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely related to her underlying lung disease and sepsis. She is at risk for further respiratory deterioration and may require additional support, such as non-invasive ventilation or tracheostomy.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's AKI is likely related to her sepsis and hypotension. She is at risk for further kidney injury and may require dialysis.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's severe aortic stenosis and atrial fibrillation put her at risk for cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock.
5. Delirium: The patient's delirium is likely related to her underlying medical conditions and medications. She is at risk for further cognitive decline and may require additional support, such as sedation and orientation.
6. Infection: The patient's indwelling portacath and central venous catheter put her at risk for central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
7. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility and malnutrition put her at risk for pressure ulcers.
8. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's immobility and underlying medical conditions put her at risk for VTE.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for pseudomonas urosepsis and monitor for signs of sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilation as needed.
3. Continue dialysis for AKI and monitor for signs of kidney injury.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust medication as needed.
5. Continue delirium management and orientation.
6. Remove the indwelling portacath and central venous catheter if possible.
7. Implement pressure ulcer prevention measures, such as regular turning and pressure-relieving mattresses.
8. Monitor for signs of VTE and consider prophylactic anticoagulation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF), who was admitted with presumed urosepsis and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Pseudomonas. She was intubated due to worsening acidosis, oliguric renal failure, and hemodynamic instability. She is currently receiving antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) for coverage of the UTI and is being monitored for other sources of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's UTI is a potential source of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's severe AS and CHF make her prone to cardiogenic shock, which can be exacerbated by hypotension and decreased cardiac output.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure is a potential complication of sepsis and may require further management, including dialysis.
4. Aortic Stenosis: The patient's severe AS makes her prone to cardiogenic shock and may require further management, including valve replacement.
5. Left Hip Pain: The patient's left hip pain may be a complication of the UTI or a separate condition that requires further evaluation and management.
6. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation makes her prone to VAP, which can be a life-threatening complication.
7. Stress Ulcer: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and use of corticosteroids make her prone to stress ulcer, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and underlying medical conditions make her prone to DVT, which can be a life-threatening complication.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications. The patient should be continued on antibiotics for coverage of the UTI, and further evaluation and management should be performed for other sources of infection. The patient's cardiogenic shock and renal failure should be closely monitored and managed, and the patient should be evaluated for further management, including valve replacement and dialysis. The patient's left hip pain should be further evaluated and managed, and the patient should be monitored for VAP and stress ulcer."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Their oxygen saturation is 99%, and their partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) is 650 mmHg.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.5°C, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 106/35 mmHg. Their central venous pressure (CVP) is 19 cmH2O, and their fluid balance is positive, with a total fluid intake of 2,864 mL and output of 309 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of multi-organ dysfunction, including:

* Elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 12.8 K/uL
* Decreased hemoglobin (Hb) level of 8.6 g/dL
* Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 62 mg/dL
* Elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 2.9 mg/dL
* Elevated lactate level of 1.0 mmol/L
* Elevated liver enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
* Elevated troponin-T level of 0.11 ng/mL

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and sedatives. They are also receiving nutritional support via a pulmonary tube.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Sepsis-induced multi-organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury (AKI), hepatic failure, and cardiovascular instability

   renal cell & ovarian Ca p/w Left hip pain, adm for presumed urosepsis
   on pressors.  Intubated on [**1-18**] for worsening acidosis, oliguric renal
   failure, hemodynamic instability [**12-25**] to Afib with RVR and MS changes.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): Source of infection presumed
   to be urosepsis with positive UA growing out pan sensitive
   Pseudomonas.  Pt clinically deteriorated on [**1-18**] with worsening
   acidosis/MS changes and was intubated.  Pressors were weaned
   immediately and pt has been maintaining MAPs with occais 500cc
   boluses.  WBC ct trended down and acidosis resolved on minimal vent
   settings.  L chest U/S was neg for abscess, CT was unrevealing for addl
   infectious sources.
   - [**Month/Year (2) **] ID consult, 2^nd GNR in Ucx likely pseudomonas
   - continue Zosyn for coverage of pseudomonas, d/c Vancomycin today as
   there is no e/o line infection.
   - ortho consult for L  hip pain, unconcerned for L hip as source of
   infection
   - continue to f/u blood & urine cultures
   - bolus prn to maintain Maps>65
 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC: resolved, pt with severe AS & CHF with EF 45%
   developed Afib with RVR and became hypotensive on [**1-18**]. Pressure
   responded to IVF & pressors.  Pt was then Intubated and pressors
   weaned. Pt still in/out of Afib but HR has been much better controlled
   on digoxin.
   - dig level 1.4 this am, will continue Digoxing 0.125mg every other day
   - avoid CCB/BBs
   - no plan for systemic anticoagulation currently, daily risk of CVA
   low, will reconsider in am
   - fluid bolus prn to maintain maps>60
RESP FAILURE: Pt was intubated on [**1-18**] due to worsening acidosis & MS
   changes.  CXR shows bilateral effusions & pulm edema.  CT showed
   possible airspace disease in [**Last Name (LF) 1056**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have been [**12-25**] aspiration
   peri-intubation.  Afebrile, WBC ct trending down, this is unlikely a
   new PNA
   - wean vent settings to [**3-28**] today, repeat ABG in pm
   - f/u RSBI in am, possible extubation in 24-48hrs
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Pt with oliguric
   renal failure likely [**12-25**] hypoperfusion vs ATN in setting of shock.
   Urine sediment filled with WBCs, no e/o casts.  Creatinine appears to
   have plateaued and pt having increased UOP overnight.  [**Month/Day (2) 1212**] Renal
   recs, there is no acute indication for dialysis. Acidosis resolved on
   vent, unclear if metabolic acidosis leading to intubation was all [**12-25**]
   uremia.  [**Month/Day (2) 1212**] renal recs- C3 low, C4 normal, urine eos negative.
   - avoid continuous IVF given poor UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   - continue phoslo TID & check lytes [**Hospital1 **]
 AORTIC STENOSIS: AS with valve area of 0.7cm, very preload
   dependant.  Gentle bolus IVF prn to maintain MAP>60
   - continue digoxin, monitor daily CXR & resp status, avoid volume
   overload preventing successful extubation
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): presumed source of infection with UA +
   pseudomonas, pan sensitive
   -          continue Vanc/Zosyn for coverage
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Stable at pts baseline. Monitoring daily.
 LEFT HIP PAIN: Etiology unclear, [**Name2 (NI) **] ortho recs.  Exam did not
   suggest a septic joint on admission, clearly very painful on
   manipulation.  CT neg for joint effusion.  Consider f/u MRI.
   - f/u ortho recs, continue Fentanyl for pain control

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis and congestive heart failure, who was admitted with presumed urosepsis and oliguric renal failure. She was intubated due to worsening acidosis and hemodynamic instability. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, severe with organ dysfunction, and the source of infection is presumed to be urosepsis with positive urine culture growing out pan-sensitive Pseudomonas. She has also been diagnosed with acute renal failure, cardiac shock, respiratory failure, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is severe with organ dysfunction, which increases the risk of further organ failure and mortality.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure may progress to anuria, leading to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
3. Cardiac Shock: The patient's cardiac shock may worsen, leading to further hemodynamic instability and cardiac arrest.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress, leading to further hypoxia and respiratory arrest.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to bleeding complications and increased risk of hemorrhage.
6. Left Hip Pain: The patient's left hip pain may be a sign of a septic joint or other underlying condition that requires further evaluation and treatment.
7. Pseudomonas Infection: The patient's Pseudomonas infection may lead to further complications, such as pneumonia, sepsis, or meningitis.
8. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's intubation and ventilation increase the risk of VAP, which can lead to further respiratory failure and mortality.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and hemodynamic status closely.
2. Adjust the patient's fluid and electrolyte management to prevent further complications.
3. Continue to provide antibiotic therapy to cover the Pseudomonas infection.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider weaning the ventilator settings.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust the fluid and electrolyte management accordingly.
6. Consider consulting with a nephrologist for further management of the patient's acute renal failure.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust the digoxin therapy as needed.
8. Consider consulting with an orthopedist to evaluate the patient's left hip pain and determine the best course of treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 45%. She was admitted for presumed urosepsis and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's condition has deteriorated over the past 24 hours, with increasing alkalosis, decreased frequency on the ventilator, and a platelet count of 56. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30% and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient has a variety of comorbidities, including chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, and sepsis with organ dysfunction. She is receiving antibiotics for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is being monitored for signs of sepsis.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 12.8
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 8.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 56
* Creatinine: 2.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 19 mg/dL
* Sodium: 138 mmol/L
* Potassium: 4.5 mmol/L
* Chloride: 102 mmol/L
* Bicarbonate: 26.7 mmol/L
* Glucose: 133 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.9 mg/dL

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 35.5°C (95.9°F)
* Heart rate: 70 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 106/35 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's physical examination is significant for bilateral pleural effusions, with the right side being more prominent. She has a central venous catheter (CVC) and an arterial line (AL) in place.

The patient's medical history is significant for severe AS, CHF, chronic kidney disease, and a history of ovarian and renal cell cancer. She has a code status of do not resuscitate (DNR) and is currently receiving ICU care.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's history of severe AS and CHF makes her susceptible to cardiogenic shock, which can be exacerbated by her current condition.
2. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) make her at risk for further renal dysfunction.
3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis with organ dysfunction and UTI make her at risk for further sepsis and organ dysfunction.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia make her at risk for further respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and her current condition make her at risk for further cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Infection: The patient's UTI and sepsis make her at risk for further infections.
7. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count of 56 and her history of bleeding make her at risk for further bleeding.

In conclusion, the patient is a high-risk individual with multiple comorbidities and a complicated medical history. She requires close monitoring and management of her condition to prevent further complications and improve her outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, currently in the ICU with urosepsis, atrial fibrillation, and acute renal failure. She is intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 71 beats per minute, blood pressure of 112/41 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on 30% FiO2.

The patient has a history of allergies to iodine, ciprofloxacin, sulfonamides, morphine, codeine, and levofloxacin. She has received antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and is currently receiving fentanyl and midazolam infusions.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.6-12.7 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 8.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 56-66 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 2.8-2.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 19-25 mg/dL
* Glucose: 104-120 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.9 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: ET tube in good position, bilateral pleural effusion, and chronic changes from pleurodesis.
* Renal ultrasound: Porta cath without fluid by ultrasound and low suspicion of seeding given GNRs rather than GPCs.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: improving on mechanical ventilation
* Sepsis: most likely source is pseudomonal urosepsis, improving
* Cardiogenic shock: rate-controlled, stable hemodynamically off of pressors
* Atrial fibrillation: rate-controlled, on digoxin, responsive to IV fluids
* Renal failure: acute, likely due to sepsis and hypotension, with increasing urine output
* Thrombocytopenia: baseline thrombocytopenia, likely from hemoconcentration and now likely at baseline
* Anemia: likely component of hemodilution, transfuse for < 21 or active bleed or if hypotension
* Aortic stenosis: severe, preload dependent
* Urinary tract infection: pseudomonas, pan-sensitive, continue zosyn X 14-day course
* Cancer: gynecological, ovarian, uterine, cervical, endometrial, follow-up on additional oncological history
* Pain control: fentanyl and midazolam infusions, consider hip pain source of infection

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Continued sepsis and organ dysfunction
2. Development of acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening of existing AKI
3. Cardiogenic shock or worsening of cardiac function
4. Respiratory failure or worsening of respiratory function
5. Thrombocytopenia or bleeding complications
6. Anemia or bleeding complications
7. Aortic stenosis-related complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias
8. Urinary tract infection-related complications, such as bacteremia or sepsis
9. Cancer-related complications, such as bleeding or metastasis
10. Pain control-related complications, such as respiratory depression or sedation

The patient's care plan includes:

* Continue mechanical ventilation and sedation
* Monitor for signs of sepsis and organ dysfunction
* Monitor for signs of cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias
* Monitor for signs of renal dysfunction and AKI
* Monitor for signs of thrombocytopenia and bleeding complications
* Monitor for signs of anemia and bleeding complications
* Monitor for signs of aortic stenosis-related complications
* Monitor for signs of urinary tract infection-related complications
* Monitor for signs of cancer-related complications
* Monitor for signs of pain control-related complications
* Continue antibiotics and antifungals as prescribed
* Continue pain control medications as prescribed
* Consider hip pain source of infection and plan accordingly
* Consider bone scan to assess for lytic lesion or micro fracture
* Consider C. difficile testing and treatment if indicated
* Consider heparin products for thrombocytopenia and bleeding complications
* Consider transfusions for anemia and bleeding complications
* Consider cardiac monitoring and treatment for cardiogenic shock or worsening of cardiac function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, and currently in the ICU for urosepsis with atrial fibrillation and renal failure. The patient's condition is improving, with decreasing lactate levels and stable vital signs.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and the note mentions the need to ""diruse some before extubation"" and ""watch for fu/o"" (fluid overload). This suggests that the patient may still be at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a diagnosis of sepsis with organ dysfunction, and the note mentions the possibility of aspiration pneumonia. The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, but the note states that ""wbc trending down, hemodynamically stable"" which suggests that the patient may still be at risk for sepsis.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and the note mentions the possibility of autodiuresis. The patient's creatinine level is decreasing, but the note states that ""cr appears to have peaked and now making some urine"" which suggests that the patient may still be at risk for renal failure.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has atrial fibrillation and severe aortic stenosis, and the note mentions the possibility of cardiogenic shock. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but the note states that ""cvp difficult to follow given severe AS"" which suggests that the patient may still be at risk for cardiovascular instability.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, and the note mentions the possibility of hemodilution. The patient's bleeding risk is low, but the note states that ""continue heparin products for now given low suspicion for HIT"" which suggests that the patient may still be at risk for bleeding.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is decreasing, and the note mentions the possibility of hemodilution. The patient's transfusion risk is low, but the note states that ""transfuse for < 21 or active bleed or if hypotension"" which suggests that the patient may still be at risk for anemia.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and at risk for multiple complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 86 y/o F with PMHx of severe AS & CHF with EF 45%,
   renal cell & ovarian Ca p/w Left hip pain, adm for presumed urosepsis
   on pressors.  Intubated on [**1-18**] for worsening acidosis, oliguric renal
   failure, hemodynamic instability [**12-25**] to Afib with RVR and MS changes.
   &#9658; SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): Source of infection
   presumed to be urosepsis with positive UA growing out pan sensitive
   Pseudomonas.  Pt clinically deteriorated on [**1-18**] with worsening
   acidosis/MS changes and was intubated.  Pressors were weaned
   immediately and pt has been maintaining MAPs with occais 500cc
   boluses.  WBC ct trended down and acidosis resolved on minimal vent
   settings.  L chest U/S was neg for abscess, CT was unrevealing for addl
   infectious sources.
   - [**Month/Year (2) **] ID consult, 2nd GNR in Ucx likely pseudomonas
   - continue Zosyn for coverage of pseudomonas, d/c Vancomycin today as
   there is no e/o line infection.
   - ortho consult for L  hip pain, unconcerned for L hip as source of
   infection
   - continue to f/u blood & urine cultures
   - bolus prn to maintain Maps>65
   &#9658; SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC: resolved, pt with severe AS & CHF with EF
   45% developed Afib with RVR and became hypotensive on [**1-18**]. Pressure
   responded to IVF & pressors.  Pt was then Intubated and pressors
   weaned. Pt still in/out of Afib but HR has been much better controlled
   on digoxin.
   - dig level 1.4 this am, will continue Digoxing 0.125mg every other day
   - avoid CCB/BBs
   - no plan for systemic anticoagulation currently, daily risk of CVA
   low, will reconsider in am
   - fluid bolus prn to maintain maps>60
   &#9658;RESP FAILURE: Pt was intubated on [**1-18**] due to worsening acidosis
   & MS changes.  CXR shows bilateral effusions & pulm edema.  CT showed
   possible airspace disease in [**Last Name (LF) 1056**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have been [**12-25**] aspiration
   peri-intubation.  Afebrile, WBC ct trending down, this is unlikely a
   new PNA
   - wean vent settings to [**3-28**] today, repeat ABG in pm
   - f/u RSBI in am, possible extubation in 24-48hrs
   &#9658; RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Pt with
   oliguric renal failure likely [**12-25**] hypoperfusion vs ATN in setting of
   shock.  Urine sediment filled with WBCs, no e/o casts.  Creatinine
   appears to have plateaued and pt having increased UOP overnight.
   [**Month/Day (2) 1212**] Renal recs, there is no acute indication for dialysis. Acidosis
   resolved on vent, unclear if metabolic acidosis leading to intubation
   was all [**12-25**] uremia.  [**Month/Day (2) 1212**] renal recs- C3 low, C4 normal, urine eos
   negative.
   - avoid continuous IVF given poor UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   - continue phoslo TID & check lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   &#9658; AORTIC STENOSIS: AS with valve area of 0.7cm, very preload
   dependant.  Gentle bolus IVF prn to maintain MAP>60
   - continue digoxin, monitor daily CXR & resp status, avoid volume
   overload preventing successful extubation
   &#9658; URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): presumed source of infection
   with UA + pseudomonas, pan sensitive
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn for coverage
   &#9658; LEFT HIP PAIN: Etiology unclear, [**Name2 (NI) **] ortho recs.  Exam did
   not suggest a septic joint on admission, clearly very painful on
   manipulation.  CT neg for joint effusion.  Consider f/u MRI.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 86 y/o F with PMHx of severe AS & CHF with EF 45%,
   renal cell & ovarian Ca p/w Left hip pain, adm for presumed urosepsis
   on pressors.  Intubated on [**1-18**] for worsening acidosis, oliguric renal
   failure, hemodynamic instability [**12-25**] to Afib with RVR and MS changes.
   &#9658; SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): Source of infection
   presumed to be urosepsis with positive UA growing out pan sensitive
   Pseudomonas.  Pt clinically deteriorated on [**1-18**] with worsening
   acidosis/MS changes and was intubated.  Pressors were weaned
   immediately and pt has been maintaining MAPs with occais 500cc
   boluses.  WBC ct trended down and acidosis resolved on minimal vent
   settings.  L chest U/S was neg for abscess, CT was unrevealing for addl
   infectious sources.
   - [**Month/Year (2) **] ID consult, 2nd GNR in Ucx likely pseudomonas
   - continue Zosyn for coverage of pseudomonas, d/c Vancomycin today as
   there is no e/o line infection.
   - ortho consult for L  hip pain, unconcerned for L hip as source of
   infection
   - continue to f/u blood & urine cultures
   - bolus prn to maintain Maps>65
   &#9658; SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC: resolved, pt with severe AS & CHF with EF
   45% developed Afib with RVR and became hypotensive on [**1-18**]. Pressure
   responded to IVF & pressors.  Pt was then Intubated and pressors
   weaned. Pt still in/out of Afib but HR has been much better controlled
   on digoxin.
   - dig level 1.4 this am, will continue Digoxing 0.125mg every other day
   - avoid CCB/BBs
   - no plan for systemic anticoagulation currently, daily risk of CVA
   low, will reconsider in am
   - fluid bolus prn to maintain maps>60
   &#9658;RESP FAILURE: Pt was intubated on [**1-18**] due to worsening acidosis
   & MS changes.  CXR shows bilateral effusions & pulm edema.  CT showed
   possible airspace disease in [**Last Name (LF) 1056**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have been [**12-25**] aspiration
   peri-intubation.  Afebrile, WBC ct trending down, this is unlikely a
   new PNA
   - wean vent settings to [**3-28**] today, repeat ABG in pm
   - f/u RSBI in am, possible extubation in 24-48hrs
   &#9658; RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Pt with
   oliguric renal failure likely [**12-25**] hypoperfusion vs ATN in setting of
   shock.  Urine sediment filled with WBCs, no e/o casts.  Creatinine
   appears to have plateaued and pt having increased UOP overnight.
   [**Month/Day (2) 1212**] Renal recs, there is no acute indication for dialysis. Acidosis
   resolved on vent, unclear if metabolic acidosis leading to intubation
   was all [**12-25**] uremia.  [**Month/Day (2) 1212**] renal recs- C3 low, C4 normal, urine eos
   negative.
   - avoid continuous IVF given poor UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   - continue phoslo TID & check lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   &#9658; AORTIC STENOSIS: AS with valve area of 0.7cm, very preload
   dependant.  Gentle bolus IVF prn to maintain MAP>60
   - continue digoxin, monitor daily CXR & resp status, avoid volume
   overload preventing successful extubation
   &#9658; URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): presumed source of infection
   with UA + pseudomonas, pan sensitive
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn for coverage
   &#9658; LEFT HIP PAIN: Etiology unclear, [**Name2 (NI) **] ortho recs.  Exam did
   not suggest a septic joint on admission, clearly very painful on
   manipulation.  CT neg for joint effusion.  Consider f/u MRI.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 45%. She was admitted with presumed urosepsis and was found to have a positive urine culture growing out pan-sensitive Pseudomonas. The patient's condition has deteriorated with worsening acidosis, oliguric renal failure, and hemodynamic instability, requiring intubation and pressors.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's severe AS and CHF make her prone to cardiogenic shock, which is already partially resolved but still requires close monitoring.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation may not be sufficient to manage her respiratory failure, and she may require further interventions to improve her oxygenation.
3. Renal failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure is likely related to hypoperfusion or acute tubular necrosis, and she may require further management to improve her renal function.
4. Sepsis: The patient's presumed urosepsis may lead to sepsis, which can cause further organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
5. Aortic stenosis: The patient's severe AS makes her prone to further complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
6. Urinary tract infection: The patient's UTI may lead to further complications, including sepsis and renal failure.
7. Left hip pain: The patient's left hip pain may be related to a septic joint or other underlying condition, which requires further evaluation and management.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued coverage of Pseudomonas with Zosyn.
2. Discontinuation of Vancomycin due to lack of evidence of line infection.
3. Ortho consult for left hip pain.
4. Continue to follow blood and urine cultures.
5. Bolus prn to maintain MAPs > 65.
6. Digoxin therapy to control heart rate and rhythm.
7. Avoidance of calcium channel blockers and beta blockers.
8. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance.
9. Avoidance of continuous IVF due to poor urine output.
10. Renal dose adjustment of all medications.
11. Phosphate supplementation and monitoring of electrolytes.
12. Fentanyl for pain control.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical complications to improve her outcomes."

   pain, adm to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for presumed urosepsis,   intubated on [**1-18**] for
   worsening acidosis and MS changes.
   #SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): presumed to be urosepsis with
   positive UA growing out pan sensitive Pseudomonas, now day 4 of Zosyn.
   Pt is s/p Intubation of [**1-18**] for worsening acidosis/MS changes, pt
   developped a worsening mixed acidosis & hypotension [**1-20**] with minimal
   vent support, switch to AC overnight & pH improved.  Hypotension did
   not resolve with 500cc bolus, required Levophed for apporx 5 hrs.
   Etiology of acidosis/hypotension unclear, possibly due to uremia,  NS
   resussitation and preload dependance given severe AS. Ruling out
   ongoing sepsis, further infectious work up neg to date, L chest U/S neg
   for abscess, CT unrevealing.  Bone scan pending today.
   - [**Month/Year (2) **] ID consult, continue Zosyn for coverage of pseudomonas in
   urine, Vanc was d/c

   sensitive.  Sputum + yeast
   - gentle bolus of 250 LR prn to maintain Maps>65
   - will repeat cultures if any recurrence of hypotension
   #SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC: Pt with severe AS & CHF with EF 45% developed Afib
   with RVR and became hypotensive on [**1-18**]. Pressure responded to IVF &
   pressors.  Pt was intubated and pressors weaned. Pt has been in/out of
   Afib but HR better controlled on digoxin.  BP dropped overnight, did
   not respond to IV bolus, required pressors approx 5hrs.  This was
   likely due to severe AS and preload dependance but concern for ongoing
   sepsis.  Extravascular volume overload and complicated fluid balance,
   goal of net even i/os.
   - continue Digoxing 0.125mg every other day, avoid CCB/BBs
   - no plan for systemic anticoagulation currently, daily risk of CVA low
   - fluid bolus 250cc LR prn to maintain maps>60
   # RESP FAILURE: Pt was intubated on [**1-18**] due to worsening acidosis & MS
   changes.  CXR shows bilateral effusions & pulm edema.  CT showed
   possible airspace disease in [**Last Name (LF) 1056**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have been [**12-25**] aspiration
   peri-intubation.  WBC ct increased at 14 today.  It is unlikely that
   this due to a new PNA, but will reculture and broaden Abx if pt
   clinically deteriorates.   Pulm edema and extravascular volume overload
   will likely be a barrier to extubation.  Goal to run i/os even, waiting
   on spontaneous diuresis.
   - repeat ABG in pm, consider weaning to [**8-28**] this evening
   - f/u RSBI in am, possible extubation over weekend
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Pt with oliguric
   renal failure likely [**12-25**] hypoperfusion vs ATN in setting of shock.
   Urine sediment filled with WBCs, no e/o casts.  Creatinine increased
   slightly overnight, likely [**12-25**] contraction,  having increased UOP.
   [**Month/Day (2) 1212**] Renal recs, there is no acute indication for dialysis. Acidosis
   improved on vent with AC, unclear if metabolic acidosis leading to
   intubation was uremia vs NS resussitation.  [**Month/Day (2) 1212**] renal recs, waiting
   on natruriesis
   - monitor i/os, goal net even
   - renally dose all meds
   - continue phoslo TID
   # AORTIC STENOSIS: AS with valve area of 0.7cm, very preload dependant
   & delicate fluid balance.  Gentle bolus with 250cc LR prn to maintain

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan: 86 y/o F with PMHx of severe AS & CHF p/w Left hip
   pain, adm to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for presumed urosepsis,   intubated on [**1-18**] for
   worsening acidosis and MS changes.
   #SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): presumed to be urosepsis with
   positive UA growing out pan sensitive Pseudomonas, now day 4 of Zosyn.
   Pt is s/p Intubation of [**1-18**] for worsening acidosis/MS changes, pt
   developped a worsening mixed acidosis & hypotension [**1-20**] with minimal
   vent support, switch to AC overnight & pH improved.  Hypotension did
   not resolve with 500cc bolus, required Levophed for apporx 5 hrs.
   Etiology of acidosis/hypotension unclear, possibly due to uremia,  NS
   resussitation and preload dependance given severe AS. Ruling out
   ongoing sepsis, further infectious work up neg to date, L chest U/S neg
   for abscess, CT unrevealing.  Bone scan pending today.
   - [**Month/Year (2) **] ID consult, continue Zosyn for coverage of pseudomonas in
   urine, Vanc was d/c
d [**1-20**]
   - ortho consult for L  hip pain, bone scan pending today for ?mets
   - Blood Cx NGTD, Urine culture + 2 diff pseudomonas, both pan
   sensitive.  Sputum + yeast
   - gentle bolus of 250 LR prn to maintain Maps>65
   - will repeat cultures if any recurrence of hypotension
   #SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC: Pt with severe AS & CHF with EF 45% developed Afib
   with RVR and became hypotensive on [**1-18**]. Pressure responded to IVF &
   pressors.  Pt was intubated and pressors weaned. Pt has been in/out of
   Afib but HR better controlled on digoxin.  BP dropped overnight, did
   not respond to IV bolus, required pressors approx 5hrs.  This was
   likely due to severe AS and preload dependance but concern for ongoing
   sepsis.  Extravascular volume overload and complicated fluid balance,
   goal of net even i/os.
   - continue Digoxing 0.125mg every other day, avoid CCB/BBs
   - no plan for systemic anticoagulation currently, daily risk of CVA low
   - fluid bolus 250cc LR prn to maintain maps>60
   # RESP FAILURE: Pt was intubated on [**1-18**] due to worsening acidosis & MS
   changes.  CXR shows bilateral effusions & pulm edema.  CT showed
   possible airspace disease in [**Last Name (LF) 1056**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have been [**12-25**] aspiration
   peri-intubation.  WBC ct increased at 14 today.  It is unlikely that
   this due to a new PNA, but will reculture and broaden Abx if pt
   clinically deteriorates.   Pulm edema and extravascular volume overload
   will likely be a barrier to extubation.  Goal to run i/os even, waiting
   on spontaneous diuresis.
   - repeat ABG in pm, consider weaning to [**8-28**] this evening
   - f/u RSBI in am, possible extubation over weekend
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Pt with oliguric
   renal failure likely [**12-25**] hypoperfusion vs ATN in setting of shock.
   Urine sediment filled with WBCs, no e/o casts.  Creatinine increased
   slightly overnight, likely [**12-25**] contraction,  having increased UOP.
   [**Month/Day (2) 1212**] Renal recs, there is no acute indication for dialysis. Acidosis
   improved on vent with AC, unclear if metabolic acidosis leading to
   intubation was uremia vs NS resussitation.  [**Month/Day (2) 1212**] renal recs, waiting
   on natruriesis
   - monitor i/os, goal net even
   - renally dose all meds
   - continue phoslo TID
   # AORTIC STENOSIS: AS with valve area of 0.7cm, very preload dependant
   & delicate fluid balance.  Gentle bolus with 250cc LR prn to maintain
   MAP>60
   - continue digoxin, monitor daily CXR & resp status, avoid volume
   overload preventing successful extubation
   # URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): presumed source of infection with UA +
   pseudomonas, pan sensitive
   - continue Zosyn renally dosed for coverage
   # LEFT HIP PAIN: Etiology unclear, [**Name2 (NI) **] ortho recs.  Exam did not
   suggest a septic joint on admission, clearly very painful on
   manipulation.  CT neg for joint effusion, bone scan pending today
   - f/u ortho recs, continue Fentanyl for pain control

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Continuing Zosyn for coverage of pseudomonas in the urine
* Monitoring for sepsis and adjusting antibiotics as necessary
* Maintaining a gentle fluid balance to prevent fluid overload
* Continuing digoxin for atrial fibrillation
* Monitoring for signs of respiratory failure and adjusting ventilator settings as necessary
* Monitoring for signs of acute kidney injury and adjusting fluid management as necessary
* Continuing pain management with fentanyl

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to her UTI and underlying medical conditions.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying lung disease and her current respiratory status.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient is at risk for acute kidney injury due to her underlying medical conditions and her current fluid management.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient is at risk for cardiac arrest due to her underlying cardiac conditions and her current medication regimen.
* Worsening of her aortic stenosis: The patient's aortic stenosis may worsen due to her current medical conditions and her medication regimen.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and her disposition is uncertain at this time."

   Microbiology: urine cx --2 pan sensitive pseudomonas
   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with severe AS, h/o renal cell and ovarian ca who presented
   with L hip pain and hypotension, in ICU with pseudomonal urosepsis c/b
   Afib/RVR, ARF (ATN)  and respiratory failure
   Overall improving, volume status and underlying severe AS complicating
   wean
   Active issues remains:
        Respiratory failure
doing well on vent with improved acidosis
   but is total body volume up and will need to diurese prior to
   extubation, urine output continues to improve and  will likely begin
   auto-diuresis phase of ATN, is likely somewhat preload dependant and in
   setting of positive pressure though at risk for significant flash pulm
   edema post extubation and resultant ischemia
             follow u/o and consider gentle diuresis later today (lasix,
   thiazide)
                    would change back to PS later  and follow abg though
   not ready for extubation
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)-pseudomonal urosepsis,
   improving, suspect recurrent hypotensive episode overnight may have
   been secondary to volume shifts, though WBC elevated, all counts are up
   and would trend
          Infection work up as previously noted, following all cx
          Continue zosyn X 14 day course
 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC--cardiogenic in setting of a-fib with RVR and
   hypotension and severe AS, needs to mobilize fluids prior to extubation
   though recently hypotensive as has preload dependence from AS  also in
   setting of positive pressure
        Starting to autodiurese,
         follow MAPs and u/o and consider gentle diuretics later
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)- reverted back to NSR, with ectopy
      Continue dig
       Daily stoke risk low and would not anticoagulate at this time given
   low plts at baseline, though would reassess as clinical picture
   improves as may remain in paroxysmal afib
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
        atn from sepsis and hypotension
        cr appears to have peaked and now with increasing u/o--will likely
   start to auto-diurese
        continue phos binder
        all meds renally dosed
   >  Leukocytosis
up slightly along with all cell counts
trend, no
   diarrhea and c diff neg and appropriate antibx coverage in place,
   follow and continue  zosyn for pseudomonas
   >  thrombocytopenia--on review of records, baseline thrombocytopenia in
   50-70 range, with initial elevation here likely from hemoconcentration
   and now likely at baseline, dic labs negative and HUS/TTP unlikely
        follow for further reduction from baseline, continue heparin
   products for now given low suspicion for HIT
   >  anemia-  h/h now stable,  likely component of hemodilution,
   transfuse for < 21 or active bleed or if hypotension
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)--pseudomonas, pan sensitive--continue
   zosyn as above X 14 day course
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL)--f/u on additional oncological hx
   > Hip pain--dose not seem source of infection but given her significant
   pain concern for some lytic lesion/fx or micro fx or bony mets-- bone

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis (AS), history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, who presented with left hip pain and hypotension. She is currently in the ICU with pseudomonal urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with right ventricular failure (Afib/RVR), acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury (ATN).

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (96.9°F)
* Heart rate: 80 bpm
* Blood pressure: 149/58 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.35, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 36 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 150 mmHg, and bicarbonate level of 19 mmol/L.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 10.9 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.3 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 56 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 2.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 28.9 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: sodium (Na): 135 mmol/L, potassium (K): 4.0 mmol/L, calcium (Ca): 8.6 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg): 2.1 mg/dL, and phosphorus (PO4): 3.8 mg/dL

The patient's medical issues include:

* Pseudomonal urosepsis
* Atrial fibrillation with right ventricular failure
* Acute respiratory failure
* Acute kidney injury (ATN)
* Anemia
* Leukocytosis
* Thrombocytopenia
* Hypotension
* Shock, cardiogenic
* Cancer, gynecological (ovarian, uterine, cervical, endometrial)

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continued antibiotic therapy with Zosyn for pseudomonal urosepsis
* Mechanical ventilation with adjustments to tidal volume, PEEP, and FiO2 as needed
* Renal replacement therapy (RRT) for acute kidney injury
* Hemodynamic support with vasopressors and fluids as needed
* Pain management with analgesics and sedatives as needed
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis and organ dysfunction

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Sepsis
* Organ dysfunction (kidney, liver, pancreas)
* Anemia
* Leukocytosis
* Thrombocytopenia
* Hypotension
* Shock
* Cancer progression or recurrence

The patient's disposition is ICU, and her code status is DNR (do not resuscitate)."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 40 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, who presented with left hip pain and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU with pseudomonal urosepsis, cardiogenic shock, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation, and her vital signs are stable. She has a history of allergies to iodine, anaphylaxis, sulfonamides, morphine, codeine, and levofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock is severe and may lead to further organ dysfunction if not managed properly.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and she is at risk of developing AKI due to her pre-existing kidney disease and septic shock.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is severe, and she requires mechanical ventilation to maintain her oxygenation.
4. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient's AFib is poorly controlled, and she is at risk of developing further arrhythmias.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and she is at risk of bleeding.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to hemodilution and may require transfusion.
7. Cancer progression: The patient's history of cancer and current symptoms of hip pain may indicate cancer progression.
8. Infection: The patient's pseudomonal urosepsis is a significant infection, and she is at risk of developing further infections.
9. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload is a concern, and she may require diuresis to manage her fluid balance.
10. Pain management: The patient's pain is significant, and she requires effective pain management to reduce her discomfort.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to manage the patient's septic shock with aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressors.
2. Monitor the patient's kidney function closely and consider dialysis if AKI develops.
3. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and consider extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) if necessary.
4. Consider cardioversion to restore normal sinus rhythm and manage the patient's AFib.
5. Monitor the patient's platelet count closely and consider platelet transfusion if necessary.
6. Consider transfusion of packed red blood cells to manage the patient's anemia.
7. Consider additional imaging studies, such as a bone scan, to evaluate the patient's hip pain.
8. Continue to manage the patient's infections with antibiotics and consider additional antibiotics if necessary.
9. Monitor the patient's fluid balance closely and consider diuresis if necessary.
10. Consider referral to a pain management specialist to optimize the patient's pain management."

   86 y/o F with PMHx of severe AS & CHF p/w Left hip pain, adm to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for presumed urosepsis,  intubated on [**1-18**] for worsening acidosis and
   MS changes.
   .
   #SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): etiology presumed urosepsis
   with positive UA growing out pan sensitive Pseudomonas, now day 6 of
   Zosyn.  Pt is s/p Intubation on [**1-18**] for worsening acidosis/MS
   changes.  Pt had transient hypotension with worsening acidosis on ABGs
   [**1-20**] intermittently requiring pressors. No recurrence of hypotension
   since.  Etiology of acidosis/hypotension unclear, possibly due to
   uremia,  NS resussitation and preload dependance. Further infectious
   work up neg to date, L chest U/S neg for abscess, CT unrevealing.  Bone
   scan negative.
   - [**Month/Year (2) **] ID consult, continue Zosyn day [**5-3**]
   - bone scan- no lytic lesions or metastatic dz
   - Blood Cx NGTD, Urine culture + 2 diff pseudomonas, both pan
   sensitive.  Sputum + yeast
   - gentle bolus of 250 LR prn to maintain Maps>65
   - will repeat cultures if any recurrence of hypotension
   .
   #SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC: Pt with severe AS & CHF with EF 45% developed Afib
   with RVR and became hypotensive on [**1-18**]. Pressure responded to IVF &
   pressors.  Pt was intubated and pressors weaned. Pt has been in/out of
   Afib but HR better controlled on digoxin.  Transient hypotension on
   [**1-20**], did not respond to bolus, required pressors approx 5hrs.  This
   was likely due to severe AS and preload dependance but concern for
   ongoing sepsis.  Extravascular volume overload and complicated fluid
   balance, goal of net even to negative i/os.
   - continue Digoxing 0.125mg every other day, avoid CCB/BBs
   - no plan for systemic anticoagulation currently, daily risk of CVA
   very low
   - fluid bolus 250cc LR prn to maintain maps>60

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and chronic heart failure (CHF) who was admitted to the ICU with presumed urosepsis. The patient has been intubated since January 18th due to worsening acidosis and mechanical ventilator changes.

The patient's current condition is stable, with no bolus requirement for blood pressure support and adequate urine output. The patient has tolerated the sedative [**8-28**] for 5 hours and has shown improvement in ABGs. The patient's respiratory support includes a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, with a set tidal volume of 450 mL and a spontaneous tidal volume of 363 mL.

The patient has a history of cardiac arrest on January 18th, which responded to IV fluids and pressors. The patient has been in and out of atrial fibrillation (Afib) but has been controlled on digoxin. The patient has also had transient hypotension on January 20th, which responded to gentle bolus of 250 mL of lactated Ringer's solution.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 14.7
* Hematocrit: 28.9
* Platelet count: 72
* Creatinine: 3.0
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 21
* Serum potassium: 4.2 mEq/L

* Serum phosphorus: 3.5 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.8 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.1 g/dL
* LDH: 124 IU/L
* Ca++: 8.8 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.5 mg/dL

The patient's radiology results show:

* Chest X-ray: bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema
* CT scan: possible airspace disease in the left lower lobe
* Bone scan: no lytic lesions or metastatic disease

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction): etiology presumed urosepsis with positive urine culture growing out pan-sensitive Pseudomonas
* Cardiogenic shock: patient with severe AS and CHF with EF 45% developed Afib with RVR and became hypotensive on January 18th
* Respiratory failure: patient was intubated on January 18th due to worsening acidosis and mechanical ventilator changes
* Acute renal failure: patient with oliguric renal failure likely due to hypoperfusion vs ATN in setting of shock
* Aortic stenosis: AS with valve area of 0.7 cm, very preload dependent and delicate fluid balance
* Urinary tract infection (UTI): presumed source of infection with UA + Pseudomonas, pan-sensitive
* Left hip pain: etiology unclear, ortho recs

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of cardiogenic shock
* Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Progression of acute kidney injury (AKI) to chronic kidney disease (CKD)
* Development of septic shock
* Complications related to the patient's underlying aortic stenosis and chronic heart failure
* Development of a nosocomial infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient is a 86-year-old female admitted to the ICU for severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF) with presumed urosepsis. She was intubated on day 1 due to worsening acidosis and mechanical ventilation changes. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, Zosyn, and has been stable off pressors for 24 hours. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 132/39 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She has a central venous catheter, arterial line, and indwelling Port-a-Cath.

Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with presumed urosepsis, and has been receiving antibiotics. However, there is a risk of recurrence of hypotension and organ dysfunction.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has severe AS and CHF, and has developed cardiogenic shock with hypotension and acute respiratory failure. She requires gentle fluid boluses to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 mmHg.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated due to worsening acidosis and mechanical ventilation changes, and has a risk of recurrent respiratory failure.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has oliguric renal failure likely due to hypoperfusion, and has been prescribed Lasix and Metolazone to attempt diuresis.
5. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe AS with a valve area of 0.7 cm, and is preload dependent and at risk of volume overload.
6. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient has a presumed urinary tract infection with a positive urine culture growing pan-sensitive Pseudomonas.
7. Left Hip Pain: The patient has left hip pain of unclear etiology, but not infectious in origin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrence of Sepsis: The patient may experience recurrence of sepsis, which could lead to further organ dysfunction and mortality.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiogenic shock and aortic stenosis put her at risk of cardiac arrest.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress, leading to further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Volume Overload: The patient's aortic stenosis and preload dependence put her at risk of volume overload, which could lead to further cardiac decompensation.
6. Infectious Complications: The patient's urinary tract infection may lead to further complications, such as bacteremia or sepsis.
7. Left Hip Pain Complications: The patient's left hip pain may worsen, leading to further discomfort and potential complications such as joint instability or infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with severe AS, h/o renal cell and ovarian ca who presented
   with L hip pain and hypotension, in ICU with pseudomonal urosepsis c/b
   Afib/RVR, ARF (ATN)  and respiratory failure
   Overall improving, volume status and underlying severe AS complicating
   wean
   Active issues remains:
   >Respiratory failure
doing well on vent with improved acidosis but is
   total body volume up and will need to diurese prior to extubation
        diurese, continue PS wean and follow abg, w/ hope to extubate in
   next 1-2 days
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)-pseudomonal urosepsis,
   improving, suspect recurrent hypotensive episode overnight may have
   been secondary to volume shifts,
           Continue zosyn X 14 day course
 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC--cardiogenic in setting of a-fib with RVR and
   hypotension and severe AS, resolved
       needs to mobilize fluids prior to extubation though recently
   hypotensive as has preload dependence from AS  also in setting of
   positive pressure
        Starting to autodiurese and will give lasix and thiazide today
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)-
      Continue dig
      Daily stoke risk low and would not anticoagulate at this time given
   low plts at baseline, though would reassess as clinical picture
   improves as may remain in paroxysmal afib
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
        atn from sepsis and hypotension
        cr peaked/palteuad and now with increasing u/o--will likely start
   to auto-diurese and start thiazide and lasix (goal 500-1 L as BP
   tolerates)
        continue phos binder
        all meds renally dosed
   >  thrombocytopenia--on review of records, baseline thrombocytopenia in
   50-70 range, with initial elevation here likely from hemoconcentration
   and now likely at baseline, dic labs negative and HUS/TTP unlikely,
   follow for further reduction from baseline, continue heparin products
   for now given low suspicion for HIT
   >  anemia-  h/h now stable,  likely component of hemodilution,
   transfuse for < 21 or active bleed or if hypotension
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL)--f/u on additional oncological hx
   > Hip pain--dose not seem source of infection but given her significant
   pain concern for some lytic lesion/fx or micro fx or bony mets-- bone
   scan negative

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with severe AS, h/o renal cell and ovarian ca who presented
   with L hip pain and hypotension, in ICU with pseudomonal urosepsis c/b
   Afib/RVR, ARF (ATN)  and respiratory failure
   Overall improving, volume status and underlying severe AS complicating
   wean
   Active issues remains:
   >Respiratory failure
doing well on vent with improved acidosis but is
   total body volume up and will need to diurese prior to extubation
        diurese, continue PS wean and follow abg, w/ hope to extubate in
   next 1-2 days
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)-pseudomonal urosepsis,
   improving, suspect recurrent hypotensive episode overnight may have
   been secondary to volume shifts,
           Continue zosyn X 14 day course
 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC--cardiogenic in setting of a-fib with RVR and
   hypotension and severe AS, resolved
       needs to mobilize fluids prior to extubation though recently
   hypotensive as has preload dependence from AS  also in setting of
   positive pressure
        Starting to autodiurese and will give lasix and thiazide today
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)-
      Continue dig
      Daily stoke risk low and would not anticoagulate at this time given
   low plts at baseline, though would reassess as clinical picture
   improves as may remain in paroxysmal afib
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
        atn from sepsis and hypotension
        cr peaked/palteuad and now with increasing u/o--will likely start
   to auto-diurese and start thiazide and lasix (goal 500-1 L as BP
   tolerates)
        continue phos binder
        all meds renally dosed
   >  thrombocytopenia--on review of records, baseline thrombocytopenia in
   50-70 range, with initial elevation here likely from hemoconcentration
   and now likely at baseline, dic labs negative and HUS/TTP unlikely,
   follow for further reduction from baseline, continue heparin products
   for now given low suspicion for HIT
   >  anemia-  h/h now stable,  likely component of hemodilution,
   transfuse for < 21 or active bleed or if hypotension
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL)--f/u on additional oncological hx
   > Hip pain--dose not seem source of infection but given her significant
   pain concern for some lytic lesion/fx or micro fx or bony mets-- bone

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, who was admitted to the ICU with pseudomonal urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute renal failure (ATN), and respiratory failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been improving, but still requires close monitoring and management. Her active issues include respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiogenic shock, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still on mechanical ventilation and may require further weaning, but the risk of respiratory failure persists.
2. Sepsis: The patient has pseudomonal urosepsis and may continue to develop septic shock if not properly managed.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has cardiogenic shock due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and severe aortic stenosis, which may worsen if not managed properly.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ATN) and may require further management, including diuresis and renal replacement therapy.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia and may require platelet transfusions if the platelet count continues to drop.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia and may require transfusions if the hemoglobin level continues to drop.
7. Cancer recurrence: The patient has a history of ovarian cancer and may be at risk for recurrence.
8. Hip pain: The patient has hip pain and may require further evaluation to determine the cause, which may include a bone scan or other imaging studies.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve her condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Active issues remains:
   >Respiratory failure
doing well on vent with improved acidosis but is
   total body volume up and will need to diurese prior to extubation
           continue PS wean and follow abg, w/ hope to extubate in next
   1-2 days after additional diuresis
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) atn from sepsis and
   hypotension
          Entering auto-diureses phase of atn and expect to start seeing
   improvement in creatinine, start thiazide and lasix (goal 500-1 L as BP
   tolerates)
         Continue phos binder and renal dosing of emds

   Total time spent: 40 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, a history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, who presented with left hip pain and hypotension. She is currently in the ICU with pseudomonal urosepsis, acute respiratory failure, and acute renal failure (ATN) secondary to sepsis and hypotension. She is on mechanical ventilation with improved acidosis, but her total body volume is up and will require diuresis prior to extubation. Her active issues include respiratory failure, renal failure, sepsis, cardiogenic shock, atrial fibrillation, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she does not receive adequate diuresis and her volume status is not optimized.
2. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may progress if her creatinine levels do not improve with diuresis and her underlying severe AS is not addressed.
3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen if her infection is not adequately treated with antibiotics and her immune system is compromised due to her underlying medical conditions.
4. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock may recur if her preload dependence from AS is not addressed and her cardiac function is not optimized.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen if her platelet count does not improve with transfusions and her underlying medical conditions are not managed.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if her hemoglobin levels do not improve with transfusions and her underlying medical conditions are not managed.
7. Cancer progression: The patient's cancer may progress if her oncological history is not adequately managed and her underlying medical conditions are not addressed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to optimize the patient's volume status with diuresis and monitor her creatinine levels closely.
2. Continue to manage the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and monitor her infection markers closely.
3. Address the patient's cardiogenic shock by optimizing her preload dependence from AS and monitoring her cardiac function closely.
4. Monitor the patient's thrombocytopenia and anemia closely and transfuse as necessary.
5. Manage the patient's underlying medical conditions, including her cancer, and monitor her oncological history closely.
6. Consider transferring the patient to a higher level of care if her condition does not improve with current management."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o F with PMHx of severe AS & CHF p/w Left hip pain, adm to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for presumed urosepsis,  intubated on [**1-18**] for worsening acidosis and
   MS changes.
   .
   #SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): etiology presumed urosepsis
   with positive UA growing out pan sensitive Pseudomonas, now day 7 of
   Zosyn.  Pt is s/p Intubation on [**1-18**] for worsening acidosis/MS
   changes.  Pt had transient hypotensive episode with worsening acidosis
   on [**1-20**]-intermittently requiring pressors. WBC now trending down,
   afebrile, no recurrence of hypotension.  Further infectious work up neg
   to date, L chest U/S neg for abscess,Bone scan negative.
   - apprec ID consult, continue Zosyn day [**6-2**]
   - bone scan- no lytic lesions or metastatic dz
   - Blood Cx NGTD, Urine culture + 2 diff pseudomonas, both pan
   sensitive.  Sputum + yeast
   - gentle bolus of 250 LR prn to maintain Maps>65
   - will repeat cultures if any recurrence of hypotension
   .
   #SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC: Pt with severe AS & CHF with EF 45% developed Afib
   with RVR and became hypotensive on [**1-18**]. Pressure responded to IVF &
   pressors.  Pt was intubated and pressors weaned. Pt has been in/out of
   Afib but HR better controlled on digoxin.  Transiently hypotensive on
   [**1-20**], required pressors approx 5hrs, likely due to severe AS and
   preload dependence. Pt with extravasc volume overload and complicated
   fluid balance.
   - continue Digoxing 0.125mg every other day, avoid CCB/BBs
   - no plan for systemic anticoagulation currently, daily risk of CVA
   very low
   - attempt aggressive diuresis today, goal -500cc
   .
   # RESP FAILURE: Pt was intubated on [**1-18**] due to worsening acidosis & MS
   changes.  CXR with effusions R>L & pulm edema.  CT showed possible
   airspace disease in [**Last Name (LF) 1056**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have been [**12-25**] aspiration peri-intubation.
   WBC ct down, it is unlikely that this due to a new PNA, but will
   reculture and broaden Abx if pt clinically deteriorates.  Pulm edema
   and extravascular volume overload may be a barrier to extubation.  Goal
   to run i/os negative 500cc today
   - tolerated [**8-28**] well for 5hrs o/n.  ABGs show normal acid base status,
   oxygenating & ventilating well.
   - f/u RSBI in am, possible extubation over weekend
   .
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Pt with oliguric
   renal failure likely [**12-25**] hypoperfusion vs ATN in setting of shock.
   Creatinine improved & having increased UOP. Acidosis improved on vent
   with AC, unclear etiology of metabolic acidosis leading to intubation.
   Apprec renal recs,  will admin Lasix & Metolazone this am to attempt
   diuresis
   - monitor i/os, goal net negative 500cc
   - renally dose all meds
   - continue phoslo TID
   .
   # AORTIC STENOSIS: AS with valve area of 0.7cm, very preload dependant
   & delicate fluid balance.  Gentle bolus with 250cc LR prn to maintain
   MAP>60
   - continue digoxin, monitor daily CXR & resp status, avoid volume
   overload preventing successful extubation
   .
   # URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): presumed source of infection with UA +
   pseudomonas, pan sensitive
   - continue Zosyn day [**6-2**] renally dosed
   # LEFT HIP PAIN: Etiology unclear but not an infectious source. Not a
   septic joint on admission, but clearly painful on manipulation now.  CT
   neg for joint effusion, bone scan neg for pathologic
   fracture/metastatic lesion

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and chronic heart failure (CHF) who was admitted to the ICU for presumed urosepsis. She was intubated on day 1 due to worsening acidosis and metabolic changes. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and urinary tract infection. She is currently receiving treatment for these conditions, including antibiotics, diuretics, and vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued sepsis and organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis is ongoing, and there is a risk of further organ dysfunction, particularly in the kidneys, liver, and lungs.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock is a significant concern, and there is a risk of further deterioration in cardiac function, particularly if her preload dependence is not managed effectively.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and there is a risk of further deterioration in lung function, particularly if her pulmonary edema is not managed effectively.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is a significant concern, and there is a risk of further deterioration in renal function, particularly if her fluid overload is not managed effectively.
5. Urinary tract infection: The patient's urinary tract infection is ongoing, and there is a risk of further complications, particularly if her infection is not fully treated.
6. Left hip pain: The patient's left hip pain is ongoing, and there is a risk of further complications, particularly if her pain is not effectively managed.
7. Aortic stenosis: The patient's aortic stenosis is a significant concern, and there is a risk of further deterioration in cardiac function, particularly if her valve area is not managed effectively.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to assess for any changes in her condition.
2. Continue to manage the patient's sepsis and organ dysfunction with antibiotics, diuretics, and vasopressors.
3. Continue to manage the patient's cardiogenic shock with vasopressors and fluids.
4. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
5. Continue to manage the patient's acute renal failure with diuretics and fluids.
6. Continue to manage the patient's urinary tract infection with antibiotics.
7. Continue to manage the patient's left hip pain with pain medication.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's aortic stenosis and manage her valve area effectively."

   #SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): etiology presumed urosepsis
   with positive UA growing out pan sensitive Pseudomonas, now day 7 of
   Zosyn.  Pt is s/p Intubation on [**1-18**] for worsening acidosis/MS
   changes.  Pt had transient hypotensive episode with worsening acidosis
   on [**1-20**]-intermittently requiring pressors. WBC now trending down,
   afebrile, no recurrence of hypotension.  Further infectious work up neg
   to date, L chest U/S neg for abscess,Bone scan negative.

   - will repeat cultures if any recurrence of hypotension
   .
   #SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC: Pt with severe AS & CHF with EF 45% developed Afib
   with RVR and became hypotensive on [**1-18**]. Pressure responded to IVF &
   pressors.  Pt was intubated and pressors weaned. Pt has been in/out of
   Afib but HR better controlled on digoxin.  Transiently hypotensive on
   [**1-20**], required pressors approx 5hrs, likely due to severe AS and
   preload dependence. Pt with extravasc volume overload and complicated
   fluid balance.
   - continue Digoxin 0.125mg every other day, avoid CCB/BBs
   - no plan for systemic anticoagulation currently, daily risk of CVA
   very low
   - schedule metolazone and lasix daily, repeat in pm if volume up

   airspace disease in [**Last Name (LF) 1056**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have been [**12-25**] aspiration peri-intubation.
   WBC ct down, it is unlikely that this due to a new PNA, but will
   reculture and broaden Abx if pt clinically deteriorates.  Pulm edema
   and extravascular volume overload may be a barrier to extubation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition:ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and chronic heart failure (CHF) who was admitted to the ICU for presumed urosepsis. The patient was intubated on day 1 due to worsening acidosis and myocardial stunning (MS) changes.

The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, specifically with cardiac, respiratory, and renal failure. The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, and they are afebrile, with no recurrence of hypotension. The patient has been treated with Zosyn for 7 days, and blood cultures are pending.

The patient has also been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock, which was treated with IV fluids and pressors. The patient has been in and out of atrial fibrillation (Afib), but their heart rate is better controlled on digoxin.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 53, and they are expected to be extubated today. The patient has a history of acute renal failure, which is likely due to hypoperfusion rather than acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient's creatinine level has improved, and they are having increased urine output.

The patient's aortic stenosis is severe, with a valve area of 0.7 cm, making them preload dependent and requiring gentle fluid boluses to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. The patient's urinary tract infection (UTI) is presumed to be the source of their infection, and they are being treated with Zosyn.

The patient's left hip pain is unclear in etiology but is not thought to be an infectious source. The patient's thrombocytopenia is being monitored, and their platelet count is currently 47.

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at 35 mL/hour
* Glycemic control: Regular insulin sliding scale
* Lines: Indwelling Port (PortaCath), Presep Catheter, and Arterial Line
* Prophylaxis: DVT with SQ UF Heparin, stress ulcer with H2 blocker, and VAP with HOB elevation, mouth care, and RSBI
* Comments: The patient is discussed on interdisciplinary rounds, and their code status is DNR (do not resuscitate). The patient's disposition is ICU.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Recurrence of sepsis or septic shock
2. Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
3. Progression of renal failure
4. Development of cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia
5. Thrombocytopenia and bleeding complications
6. Left hip pain or infection
7. Complications related to aortic stenosis, such as heart failure or arrhythmias
8. Development of stress ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding
9. Complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or respiratory failure
10. Development of nosocomial infections, such as urinary tract infections or pneumonia."

   with L hip pain and hypotension, in ICU with pseudomonal urosepsis c/b
   Afib/RVR, ARF (ATN)  and respiratory failure
   Overall improving, volume status and underlying severe AS complicating
   wean, though has been diuresing well
   Active issues remains:
   > Respiratory failure
doing well w/ minimal vent support, alert and
   following commands, rsbi 50's and diuresing nicely.  CXR essentially
   stable with chronic changes at R base (h/o R pleurodesis)
          Check abg on PS 5/5 and if remains stable would extubate.
   Consider trial of NPPV if problems with oxygenation/chf post
   extubation
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) atn from sepsis and
   hypotension
         Entering auto-diureses phase of atn and expect to start seeing
   improvement in creatinine
         Continue thiazide and lasix (goal 500-1 L negative as BP
   tolerates)
         Continue phos binder and renal dosing of meds
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)-pseudomonal urosepsis,

 check 12 lead
             Continue dig
      Daily stoke risk low and would not anticoagulate at this time given
   low plts at baseline, though would reassess as clinical picture
   improves as may remain in paroxysmal afib
   >  thrombocytopenia--baseline thrombocytopenia in 50-70 range, with
   initial elevation here likely from hemoconcentration and now appears at
   baseline, dic labs negative and HUS/TTP unlikely,  follow for further
   reduction from baseline, continue heparin products for now given low
   suspicion for HIT, recheck plt later today given slight decrease from

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, a history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, who presented with left hip pain and hypotension. She is currently in the ICU with pseudomonal urosepsis, acute respiratory failure, and acute renal failure (ATN). Her condition is improving, with stable vital signs and minimal ventilator support. She is at risk for respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which can worsen if not managed properly. She may require additional respiratory support, such as non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), if she is extubated.
2. **Renal Failure:** The patient has acute renal failure (ATN) and is at risk for further deterioration. Her creatinine levels are increasing, and she may require further diuresis and renal dosing of medications.
3. **Sepsis:** The patient has pseudomonal urosepsis, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction. She is at risk for further infection and sepsis.
4. **Cardiogenic Shock:** The patient has cardiogenic shock in the setting of atrial fibrillation with right ventricular dysfunction and severe aortic stenosis. She is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest.
5. **Thrombocytopenia:** The patient has thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding. She may require further monitoring and treatment to prevent bleeding.
6. **Anemia:** The patient has anemia, which can worsen if not managed properly. She may require further transfusions to maintain a safe hemoglobin level.
7. **Cancer:** The patient has a history of cancer, which can increase the risk of further complications and mortality.

**Plan:**

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue diuresis and renal dosing of medications to manage renal failure.
2. Monitor and manage respiratory failure with minimal ventilator support.
3. Continue antibiotics to treat pseudomonal urosepsis.
4. Monitor and manage cardiogenic shock with digoxin and diuresis.
5. Monitor and manage thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions if necessary.
6. Monitor and manage anemia with transfusions if necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cancer status and manage any related complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, who presented with left hip pain and hypotension. She was admitted to the ICU with pseudomonal urosepsis, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure. She has been improving, with minimal ventilator support, and is following commands. The patient's active issues include respiratory failure, acute renal failure, sepsis, cardiogenic shock, atrial fibrillation, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she still requires minimal ventilator support. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if her condition deteriorates.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with an estimated creatinine of 3.1 mg/dL. She is at risk of further kidney damage if not managed properly.
3. Sepsis: The patient has resolved pseudomonal urosepsis, but there is still a risk of developing sepsis from other sources.
4. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has resolved cardiogenic shock, but there is still a risk of developing shock if her cardiac status deteriorates.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which can increase her risk of developing heart failure and stroke.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which can increase her risk of bleeding if not managed properly.
7. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can increase her risk of developing heart failure and other complications if not managed properly.
8. Cancer: The patient has a history of cancer, which can increase her risk of developing complications from her underlying medical conditions.
9. Hip Pain: The patient has hip pain, which can be a source of discomfort and pain if not managed properly.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve her condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and chronic heart failure (CHF) who was admitted to the ICU for presumed urosepsis. She was intubated on January 18th due to worsening acidosis and was successfully extubated on January 23rd.

Current status:

* Vital signs: Stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 116/35 mmHg, respiratory rate of 39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
* Laboratory results: White blood cell count is trending down, hemoglobin is 8.3 g/dL, and platelet count is 40 K/uL.
* Physical examination: The patient is sleeping comfortably, with anasarca and bilateral pitting edema.
* Radiology: Chest X-ray shows a large right pleural effusion and a hazy opacity at the left base, suggesting underlying effusion.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to worsening acidosis and MS changes, and was successfully extubated. However, there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to the presence of pleural effusions and pulmonary edema.
2. Renal failure: The patient has oliguric renal failure, likely due to hypoperfusion or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of shock. The creatinine level is still above baseline, and the patient is being actively diuresed with Lasix and Metolazone.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a UTI, with a positive urine culture growing out Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is pan-sensitive. The patient is being treated with Zosyn, and the Foley catheter should be removed as soon as possible.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is trending down, and there is a concern for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient is being held on all heparin products and will undergo a HIT antibody test.
5. Left hip pain: The etiology of the patient's left hip pain is unclear, but it is not thought to be an infectious source. The patient is being treated with Fentanyl for pain control, and a physical therapy consult has been ordered.
6. Delirium: The patient has delirium, likely secondary to intubation, polypharmacy, and prolonged ICU stay. The patient is being treated with Olanzapine, and speech and swallow evaluation will be performed prior to advancement of diet.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but there are several potential medical complications that need to be closely monitored and managed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted to the hospital for presumed urosepsis. The patient was intubated on day 1 for worsening acidosis and metabolic changes. The patient's condition has been stable over the past 24 hours, with a decrease in white blood cell count, no recurrence of hypotension, and no new signs of infection.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including:

1. Aortic stenosis: The patient has severe AS with a valve area of 0.7 cm, making her very preload dependent and delicate fluid balance.
2. Congestive heart failure: The patient has CHF with an ejection fraction of 45%, which has led to pulmonary edema and extravascular volume overload.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated on day 1 due to worsening acidosis and metabolic changes, and has been on ventilator support since then.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has oliguric renal failure, likely due to hypoperfusion or acute tubular necrosis, and has been on dialysis.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been trending down, with a current count of 47.
6. Urinary tract infection: The patient has a presumed UTI with a positive urine culture growing out pan-sensitive Pseudomonas.
7. Left hip pain: The patient has left hip pain of unclear etiology, with a negative CT scan and bone scan for joint effusion or pathologic fracture.

The patient's current medications include:

1. Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam) for presumed UTI
2. Digoxin for heart failure
3. Lasix and metolazone for fluid management
4. Fentanyl for pain control
5. Tylenol and dilaudid for pain prn

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 66 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 116/35 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 39 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 99% on 2 liters of nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show:

1. White blood cell count: 7.4 x 10^9/L
2. Hematocrit: 26.6%
3. Platelet count: 47 x 10^9/L
4. Creatinine: 3.1 mg/dL
5. Blood urea nitrogen: 91 mg/dL
6. Glucose: 144 mg/dL
7. Sodium: 142 mmol/L
8. Potassium: 4.6 mmol/L
9. Chloride: 109 mmol/L
10. Bicarbonate: 23 mmol/L

The patient's chest X-ray shows a large right pleural effusion and a hazy opacity at the left base, suggesting underlying effusion. The patient's EKG shows sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block and frequent premature atrial contractions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, who presented with left hip pain and hypotension. She was diagnosed with pseudomonal urosepsis, which is now resolved. She remains on mechanical ventilation and has been extubated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, and blood pressure of 139/44 mmHg. Her respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 100% and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 333. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 11 mmHg and a total fluid balance of -2,207 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show acute kidney injury (ATN) with a creatinine level of 3.1 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a potassium level of 4.6 mg/dL. Her complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 7.4 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, and a platelet count of 47 K/uL.

The patient's imaging studies are negative for any new findings. Her assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure: stable since extubation
* Renal failure: acute, ATN, expected to improve with diuresis
* Sepsis: severe, pseudomonal urosepsis, now resolved
* Cardiogenic shock: resolved
* Atrial fibrillation: now in sinus rhythm with ectopy
* Thrombocytopenia: baseline, likely from hemoconcentration
* Anemia: stable, transfuse for < 21 or active bleed or hypotension
* Cancer: gynecological, follow-up on additional oncological history
* Hip pain: not a source of infection, further evaluation pending
* Delirium: sundowning, consider starting zyprexa
* Nutrition: crushed pills, speech and swallow assessment pending
* Glycemic control: regular insulin sliding scale
* Lines: indwelling port, presep catheter, and arterial line, plans to discontinue central line and arterial line

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: worsening of oxygenation, need for reintubation
* Renal failure: progression to chronic kidney disease, need for dialysis
* Sepsis: recurrence, need for further antibiotic therapy
* Cardiogenic shock: recurrence, need for further cardiac monitoring
* Atrial fibrillation: recurrence, need for further anticoagulation therapy
* Thrombocytopenia: progression to bleeding, need for further platelet transfusion
* Anemia: progression to bleeding, need for further transfusion
* Cancer: progression, need for further oncological therapy
* Hip pain: worsening of pain, need for further evaluation and treatment
* Delirium: worsening of cognitive status, need for further psychiatric evaluation
* Nutrition: malnutrition, need for further nutritional support
* Glycemic control: hyperglycemia, need for further insulin therapy
* Lines: complications such as infection, need for further monitoring and management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis (AS), history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, who presented with left hip pain and hypotension. She had resolved pseudomonal urosepsis and was diagnosed with acute renal failure (ATN), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and respiratory failure. She was intubated and extubated yesterday. The patient is currently stable, with excellent ventilation and oxygenation, and is in the auto-diuresis phase of ATN. She has a history of thrombocytopenia and is being monitored for potential bleeding complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she is at risk for further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Renal failure: The patient has ATN, and her creatinine levels are increasing. She may require further management of her renal function, including dialysis.
3. Sepsis: Although the patient's pseudomonal urosepsis has resolved, she is at risk for further septic complications, such as septic shock or organ dysfunction.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has severe AS, which increases her risk for cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which increases her risk for bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
6. Delirium: The patient has a history of delirium, which may require further management, including the use of antipsychotics.
7. Hip pain: The patient has hip pain, which may require further evaluation and management, including the use of pain medication or physical therapy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her ventilator settings as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's renal function, including the use of diuretics and monitoring of creatinine levels.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status, including her heart rate and blood pressure.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding risk, including her platelet count and bleeding time.
5. Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's hip pain, including the use of pain medication or physical therapy.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's delirium, including her mental status and response to antipsychotics.
7. Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's sepsis, including the use of antibiotics or other antimicrobial agents."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis and chronic heart failure, admitted to the ICU for presumed urosepsis. The patient has undergone several interventions, including intubation, extubation, and diuresis, and has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, urinary tract infection, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a blood pressure of 111/36 mmHg, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 24 inspirations per minute. The patient is still confused and has not been able to eat or drink, pending further evaluation.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 40 K/uL. The patient's creatinine level is 2.9 mg/dL, and her urine output is improving.

The patient's radiology results show a chest X-ray with effusions and pulmonary edema, and a computed tomography (CT) scan showing possible airspace disease in the left lung.

The patient's medications include furosemide, metoprolol, and Zosyn, which is being continued for the urinary tract infection. The patient is also receiving lasix, digoxin, and olanzapine.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a history of severe aortic stenosis and chronic heart failure, which increases the risk of cardiovascular instability.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Urinary tract infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection, which may progress to sepsis if not treated properly.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, which may recur if not managed properly.
6. Delirium: The patient has delirium, which may be caused by polypharmacy, prolonged ICU stay, and other factors.
7. Left hip pain: The patient has left hip pain, which may be caused by an infectious source or other factors.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue diuresis with lasix and furosemide to manage fluid overload and improve renal function.
2. Continue Zosyn for the urinary tract infection and monitor for signs of sepsis.
3. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider platelet transfusions if necessary.
4. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory status with supplemental oxygen and diuresis.
5. Continue to manage the patient's delirium with olanzapine and other medications as necessary.
6. Continue to manage the patient's left hip pain with Tylenol and dilaudid as necessary.
7. Consider a speech and swallow evaluation prior to advancing the patient's diet."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

She has been receiving IV antibiotics, diuretics, and vasopressors. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 111/36 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is still confused and has a history of anaphylaxis to certain medications.

The patient has a central venous catheter and an arterial line, which were stopped due to the development of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate. She has also developed a rash on her sacrum and diffuse intertriginous rash.

Laboratory results show:

* Platelet count: 40 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.3 g/dL
* Creatinine: 2.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 26 mEq/L
* Electrolyte imbalance: hypokalemia (3.6 mEq/L) and hypocalcemia (7.0 mg/dL)

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury
* Cardiogenic shock with potential for cardiac arrest
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias
* Renal failure with potential for further deterioration
* Anaphylaxis to certain medications, potentially life-threatening
* Respiratory failure, potentially requiring mechanical ventilation
* Gastrointestinal bleeding, potentially due to stress ulcer disease
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and hypercoagulability
* Infection control issues, potentially due to the patient's immunocompromised state and presence of central lines and urinary catheters."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF), who was admitted to the ICU with presumed urosepsis and intubated for worsening acidosis and respiratory changes. The patient was successfully extubated on the 3rd day of admission.

The patient has been experiencing significant medical complications, including:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) with oliguric renal failure, likely due to hypoperfusion or acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
2. Respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A.Fib with RVR), which has responded to IV bolus and beta blockers.
4. Thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 40,000/μL, which has responded to holding heparin products.
5. Left hip pain, etiology unclear, but unlikely due to infectious source.
6. Confusion and delirium, likely secondary to intubation, polypharmacy, and prolonged ICU stay.
7. Urinary tract infection (UTI) with positive urine culture for Pseudomonas, which is pan-sensitive and being treated with Zosyn.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 6.1 K/μL
* Hct: 25.4%
* Plt: 40,000/μL
* Cr: 2.9 mg/dL
* TCO2: 27 mmHg
* Glucose: 91 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 13.0/36.2/1.1, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 39/8/0.11, ALT/AST: 20/25, Alk Phos/T Bili: 54/0.5, Differential-Neuts: 91.2%, Band: 0.0%, Lymph: 4.2%, Mono: 4.5%, Eos: 0.1%, Fibrinogen: 603 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 1.0 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.1 g/dL, LDH: 124 IU/L, Ca++: 8.8 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL, PO4: 4.7 mg/dL

The patient's current medications include:

* Furosemide (Lasix) 120mg IV prn for a goal of negative 1L/day
* Metoprolol 5mg IV x 1 for rate control
* Olanzapine for delirium
* Zosyn 2g IV q8h for UTI
* Colace, Allopurinol, ISS, Lidocaine patch, Famotidine, Lasix prn
* Tylenol standing for pain management

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue diuresis with Lasix 120mg IV prn for a goal of negative 1L/day
* Monitor creatinine with diuresis
* Renally dose all medications
* Continue Zosyn 2g IV q8h for UTI
* D/c foley as soon as possible
* Speech and swallow f/u eval prior to adv diet
* PT consultation for left hip pain
* Continue Olanzapine for delirium
* Monitor platelet count and consider holding heparin products and f/u HIT Ab

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further decline in kidney function
* Development of sepsis or septic shock
* Prolonged mechanical ventilation
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
* Skin breakdown or pressure ulcers
* Respiratory failure or worsening lung injury
* Infectious complications, such as pneumonia or catheter-related infections."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female with a complex medical history, including severe aortic stenosis, renal cell and ovarian cancer, and a current diagnosis of urosepsis. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has undergone various interventions, including antibiotics, fluid management, and cardiac medications.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 35.5°C, HR 143 bpm, BP 106/44 mmHg, RR 25 insp/min, SpO2 99%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 11 mmHg, MAP 60 mmHg
* Respiratory support: O2 delivery device, nasal cannula, SpO2 99%
* Cardiovascular: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, tachycardic, and hypotensive
* Renal function: Acute kidney injury with anuria, creatinine 3.5 mg/dL, and urine output 3.275 mL
* Laboratory results: WBC 6.1, Hct 25.4, Plt 42, Cr 2.9, TCO2 25, Glucose 91
* Imaging: Chest X-ray shows bilateral effusions and chronic changes in the right base
* Microbiology: Urine culture negative for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ciprofloxacin-resistant, and multiple antibiotic-resistant organisms

The patient's active issues include:

* Atrial fibrillation: Recurrent atrial fibrillation overnight, likely due to significant diuresis and volume shifts, improving with IV fluids and beta-blockers
* Thrombocytopenia: Baseline thrombocytopenia in the 50-70 range, with initial elevation likely from hemoconcentration, then at baseline
* Delirium: ICU and impaired sleep-wake cycle, likely due to narcotics, continue zyprexa, reorient, and optimize sleep cycle at night
* Renal failure: Acute kidney injury with anuria, creatinine 3.5 mg/dL, and urine output 3.275 mL, expect to start seeing improvement in creatinine with auto-diuresis phase
* Sepsis: Pseudomonal urosepsis, now resolved, completing Zosyn course day 9
* Shock: Cardiogenic in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypotension, resolved

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke
* Thrombocytopenia, which may increase the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage
* Delirium, which may worsen cognitive function, increase risk of falls, and prolong ICU stay
* Renal failure, which may lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and cardiovascular instability
* Sepsis, which may recur or progress to septic shock
* Shock, which may recur or progress to cardiogenic shock, leading to cardiac arrest and death

In summary, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical issues, including atrial fibrillation, thrombocytopenia, delirium, renal failure, and sepsis. The patient's condition is stable, but ongoing close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent potential medical complications and optimize outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, who presented with left hip pain and hypotension. She had resolved pseudomonal urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute renal failure (ATN), delirium, and respiratory failure. She was extubated and is currently stable. Active issues include atrial fibrillation, thrombocytopenia, delirium, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial Fibrillation: Recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is a concern, especially given the patient's history of severe aortic stenosis. Monitoring of heart rate and rhythm, as well as management of digoxin and beta blockers, is crucial.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's baseline thrombocytopenia, likely due to her history of cancer, may be exacerbated by her current condition. Monitoring of platelet count and platelet transfusions may be necessary.
3. Delirium: The patient's delirium is likely due to ICU stay, impaired sleep-wake cycle, and narcotics. Optimization of sleep cycle, reduction of narcotics, and reorientation are important.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure (ATN) is likely due to sepsis and hypotension. Monitoring of creatinine levels and adjusting of medications to renal dosing is crucial.
5. Sepsis: Although the patient's pseudomonal urosepsis has resolved, she is still at risk for sepsis. Monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results is essential.
6. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock, likely due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypotension, has resolved. However, monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is necessary.
7. Hip Pain: The patient's hip pain does not seem to be the source of infection, and further evaluation with a bone scan was negative. Management of pain with lidocaine patch and readdressing pain level once extubated is necessary.
8. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to her underlying medical conditions and sepsis. Monitoring of oxygen saturation and adjusting of respiratory support is crucial.
9. Nutrition: The patient is currently NPO, and further evaluation of her nutritional needs is necessary.
10. Glycemic Control: The patient is on regular insulin sliding scale, and monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential.
11. Lines: The patient has an indwelling port, and monitoring of line patency and potential complications is necessary.
12. Prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP, and prophylactic measures should be taken.
13. Code Status: The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order, and her family should be informed of this decision.
14. Disposition: The patient is currently in the ICU, and possible transfer to the floor later if her heart rate is stable."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, who presented with left hip pain and hypotension. She has resolved pseudomonal urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR), acute renal failure (ATN), delirium, and respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is stable since extubation, with the following active issues:

1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has recurrent AFib overnight, which is improving with IV fluids and beta blockers. The plan is to continue digoxin and beta blockers as needed, monitor urine output, and give lasix as needed.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a slow drop in platelet count, but the suspicion of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is low. Heparin products have been stopped, and a HIT panel has been sent. The platelet count has improved and is now at a prior baseline.
3. Delirium: The patient has impaired sleep-wake cycle, which is being managed with zyprexa, reorientation, and optimization of sleep cycle at night. Narcotics are being limited.
4. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF): The patient has ATN from sepsis and hypotension. The plan is to continue phosphorus binder and renal dosing of medications pending further improvement.
5. Sepsis, Severe (with Organ Dysfunction): The patient has resolved pseudomonal urosepsis, and the course of Zosyn is being completed. The patient remains afebrile with normal white blood cell count.
6. Shock, Cardiogenic: The patient had cardiogenic shock in the setting of AF with RVR and hypotension, but it has resolved. The plan is to mobilize fluids, continue digoxin, and monitor blood pressure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recurrent AFib with RVR, which can lead to further cardiac complications.
2. Thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Delirium, which can lead to further cognitive decline and increased risk of falls.
4. Renal failure, which can progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed properly.
5. Sepsis, which can recur if the patient is not properly managed.
6. Cardiogenic shock, which can recur if the patient's cardiac condition is not properly managed.

The patient's current medications include:

1. Digoxin
2. Beta blockers
3. Lasix
4. Phosphorus binder
5. Zyprexa
6. Regular insulin sliding scale
7. Lido patch
8. Dilaudid

The patient's current lab results include:

1. White blood cell count: 6.1
2. Hemoglobin: 8.3 g/dL
3. Platelet count: 42
4. Creatinine: 2.9
5. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 156 mg/dL

11. LDH: 124 IU/L
12. Calcium: 8.6 mg/dL
13. Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
14. Phosphorus: 4.7 mg/dL

The patient's current imaging results include:

1. Chest X-ray: showing bilateral effusions, small volumes, and chronic changes in the right base.

The patient's current microbiology results include:

1. Urine culture: negative for pseudomonal urosepsis.
2. Blood culture: negative.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Continuing digoxin and beta blockers as needed.
2. Monitoring urine output and giving lasix as needed.
3. Continuing phosphorus binder and renal dosing of medications pending further improvement.
4. Completing the course of Zosyn.
5. D/c Foley catheter as mental status clears.
6. Mobilizing fluids and monitoring blood pressure.
7. Evaluating hip pain with a bone scan, which was negative.
8. Continuing lido patch and readdressing pain level once extubated.
9. ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
10. Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate).
11. Possible floor transfer later if heart rate stable, given recurrent AFib with RVR."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted to the ICU for urosepsis. She had been intubated on day 1 and extubated on day 3, but has since developed intermittent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and delirium. She is currently receiving IV metoprolol and furosemide, and has a free water deficit of approximately 2.5L. She has also developed oliguric renal failure, which has responded to diuresis. Her respiratory status is stable, but she is at risk for aspiration due to her delirium and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of severe AS and CHF makes her susceptible to cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's delirium and altered mental status make her at risk for aspiration, which can lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia.
4. Infectious Complications: The patient's history of urosepsis and positive urine culture for Pseudomonas makes her susceptible to future infectious complications.
5. Thrombotic Complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and history of heparin exposure make her at risk for thrombotic complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
6. Wound Complications: The patient's sacral skin breakdown and intertriginous rash make her at risk for wound complications such as infection and dehiscence.
7. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen if not managed properly, leading to increased risk of falls, respiratory complications, and other medical complications.
8. Nutritional Complications: The patient's NPO status and altered mental status make her at risk for malnutrition and dehydration.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust medications as necessary to prevent cardiac complications.
2. Manage the patient's renal failure with diuresis and monitor her fluid status closely to prevent further complications.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide supplemental oxygen as necessary to prevent respiratory complications.
4. Monitor the patient's infectious status closely and treat any new infections promptly to prevent further complications.
5. Monitor the patient's thrombotic risk factors closely and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary to prevent thrombotic complications.
6. Provide wound care consult and follow recommendations to prevent wound complications.
7. Manage the patient's delirium with non-pharmacological interventions and monitor her closely for signs of worsening delirium.
8. Provide nutritional support and monitor the patient's nutritional status closely to prevent malnutrition and dehydration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of stroke.
	* Severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF) can worsen the patient's cardiac condition, leading to increased mortality.
	* Metoprolol therapy may not be sufficient to control AFib with RVR, and the patient may require additional anticoagulation or cardioversion.
2. Renal complications:
	* Acute renal failure (ARF) is likely due to hypoperfusion or ATN in the setting of shock.
	* Oliguric renal failure may worsen if the patient is not adequately diuresed, leading to further fluid overload and increased risk of cardiovascular complications.
	* Renal dysfunction may require continued monitoring and adjustment of diuretic therapy to avoid aggressive volume loss and precipitate AFib with RVR.
3. Respiratory complications:
	* Pneumonia or aspiration can worsen the patient's respiratory status, leading to increased risk of respiratory failure and mortality.
	* Chronic changes in the lungs, such as pleurodeisis, may be contributing to the patient's respiratory issues.
	* The patient's respiratory status may require continued monitoring and adjustment of supplemental oxygen and diuresis therapy.
4. Infectious complications:
	* Presumed urosepsis with positive urine culture for Pseudomonas may require further antibiotic therapy and monitoring for signs of sepsis.
	* Sputum positive for yeast may indicate an opportunistic infection, which may require additional antifungal therapy.
5. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Delirium may be secondary to intubation, polypharmacy, and prolonged ICU stay, and may require continued monitoring and adjustment of sedation therapy.
	* Aspiration risk is high due to the patient's respiratory status and delirium, and may require continued monitoring and adjustment of nutrition and hydration therapy.
6. Thrombocytopenia:
	* The patient's platelet count has trended down over the last 2 days, which may be related to heparin therapy.
	* Holding heparin products and monitoring platelet counts may be necessary to prevent further thrombocytopenia.

Overall, the patient requires continued close monitoring and adjustment of therapy to manage these potential complications and prevent further deterioration in their condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, who presented with left hip pain and hypotension. She was diagnosed with pseudomonal urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), acute renal failure (ATN), delirium, and respiratory failure. She has been stabilized since extubation.

Active issues remain:

1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): Recurrent AFib overnight, and the patient is being treated with digoxin and beta blockers.
2. Delirium: The patient continues to exhibit delirium, which is a main issue, and the team is working to optimize sleep cycle at night, limit narcotics, and consult with a delirium specialist.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is stable on minimal oxygen, but a chest X-ray is needed to recheck her condition.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are being maintained with D5, and her sodium levels will be followed.
5. Sacral abrasions: The patient has sacral abrasions, and wound care is being provided.
6. Nutrition: The patient's nutrition is being managed due to aspiration risk and agitation, and a nasogastric tube (NGT) has not been placed.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and the team is monitoring it closely.
8. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF): The patient has ARF due to sepsis and hypotension, and her creatinine levels are improving.
9. Sepsis, Severe (with Organ Dysfunction): The patient's sepsis has resolved, and she is being monitored for any signs of organ dysfunction.
10. Shock, Cardiogenic: The patient's cardiogenic shock has resolved, and she is being managed with fluids and medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Recurrent atrial fibrillation: The patient's AFib is recurring, and the team needs to continue monitoring her condition.
2. Delirium: The patient's delirium is a significant issue, and the team needs to continue optimizing her sleep cycle and managing her agitation.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia can worsen if her oxygen saturation levels drop further.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia can lead to complications if not managed properly.
5. Sacral abrasions: The patient's sacral abrasions can become infected or worsen if not managed properly.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can worsen if not managed properly.
7. Renal failure: The patient's ARF can worsen if her creatinine levels continue to rise.
8. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis can recur if not properly managed.
9. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock can recur if her cardiac function worsens.

The patient's overall condition is critical, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent complications and improve her outcome."

free water deficit in setting of NPO and diuresis,
   maintenance with D 5 [**11-24**]--follow sodium
   >  Sacral abrasions--wound care following, mattress
   >  Nutrition--aspiration risk and agitated so will hold on placing NGT,
   and start maintenance ivf
   >  Thrombocytopenia--
       Low ate baseline, though low suspicion of hit, heparin products
   stopped and Hit panel sent,  Now improved and at prior baseline.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) atn from sepsis and
   hypotension
        Auto-diureses phase of atn, creatinine improving, holding on
   diuresis
        d/c phoslo
        Renal dosing of meds pending further improvement
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)-pseudomonal urosepsis, now
   resolved
        Completed  zosyn course X 10 days
        Remains af with normal wbc ct
        d/c foley as mental status clears
 SHOCK, CARDIOGENIC--cardiogenic in setting of a-fib with RVR and
   hypotension and severe AS, resolved
        mobilizing fluids, continue dig, BB
   >  Hip pain--dose not seem source of infection, given pain have further
   evaluated with bone scan which was  negative,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, who presented with left hip pain and hypotension. She developed pseudomonal urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute renal failure, delirium, and respiratory failure. She was extubated and has been stable since then. Current issues include atrial fibrillation, delirium, hypoxemia, hypernatremia, sacral abrasions, nutrition concerns, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and hip pain.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is recurrent and may lead to further complications such as stroke or heart failure.
2. Delirium: The patient's delirium is a major concern and may worsen if not managed properly. It may lead to increased risk of falls, respiratory complications, and prolonged hospital stay.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory failure or cardiac complications.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to further complications such as seizures, coma, or even death if not managed properly.
5. Sacral Abrasions: The patient's sacral abrasions may lead to infection, further complicating her condition.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase her risk of bleeding complications if not managed properly.
7. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, or even death.
8. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may recur if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as organ dysfunction or death.
9. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as cardiac arrest or death.
10. Hip Pain: The patient's hip pain may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as infection, arthritis, or even amputation.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and chronic heart failure (CHF) who was admitted to the hospital with left hip pain, urosepsis, and sepsis. The patient has undergone several interventions, including extubation, diuresis, and antibiotic therapy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.6°C, HR 57 bpm, BP 95/26 mmHg, RR 25 inspirations per minute, SpO2 100%
* Laboratory results: WBC 6.1, Hct 25.4, Plt 40, Cr 2.9, TCO2 26, Glucose 91
* Imaging studies: Portable CXR shows bilateral pleural effusions with probable basilar atelectasis and some engorgement of the pulmonary vessels
* Infectious work-up: Blood culture negative, urine culture positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was treated with Zosyn for 10 days
* Renal failure: Oliguric renal failure likely due to hypoperfusion or acute tubular necrosis, responded well to diuresis and has a goal of net negative fluid balance
* Respiratory failure: Patient was intubated due to worsening acidosis and metabolic changes, extubated successfully on day 5, currently receiving supplemental oxygen
* Neurological status: Patient has delirium likely secondary to intubation, polypharmacy, and prolonged ICU stay
* Wound care: Sacral skin breakdown and intertriginous rash, being managed with kinair mattress, reg position changes, flexiseal, NS cleanser, and aquacel dressing

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of severe AS and CHF, there is a high risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
2. Renal failure: The patient's current renal function is compromised, and further deterioration can occur if not managed properly.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and further deterioration can occur if not managed properly.
4. Wound infection: The patient's wound is at risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and further complications.
5. Delirium: The patient's delirium is likely secondary to polypharmacy and prolonged ICU stay, and can lead to further complications if not managed properly.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and further management is needed to prevent bleeding complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve her overall condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis and chronic heart failure, admitted to the hospital with left hip pain and urosepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, and sepsis. She has been treated with antibiotics, diuretics, and other medications, and has undergone various interventions, including extubation and removal of restraints.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.6°C, heart rate 57 beats per minute, blood pressure 95/26 mmHg, respiratory rate 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%.
* Laboratory results: White blood cell count 6.1 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin 7.3 g/dL, platelet count 61 x 10^9/L, creatinine 3.1 mg/dL, and sodium 155 mmol/L.
* Imaging studies: Chest X-ray shows bilateral pleural effusions with probable basilar atelectasis and engorgement of pulmonary vessels.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's history of severe aortic stenosis and chronic heart failure increases her risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure exacerbation, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
* Renal complications: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory arrest or the need for mechanical ventilation.
* Infectious complications: The patient's history of urosepsis and sepsis increases her risk of developing further infections, such as pneumonia or bloodstream infections.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and constipation increases her risk of developing further gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
* Neurological complications: The patient's history of delirium and altered mental status increases her risk of developing further neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition and history of multiple comorbidities increase her risk of developing further complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Code status: DNR/DNI
   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF), who was admitted to the ICU with urosepsis and subsequently developed acute kidney injury (AKI) and respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tachycardic, hypotensive, and tachypneic
* Cardiac rhythm: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR)
* Respiratory status: Oliguric with possible pulmonary edema
* Renal function: Acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 3.1 mg/dL
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is on IV fluids and vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 907 mL of IV fluids and has a positive fluid balance of 752 mL

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Worsening pulmonary edema: The patient's fluid overload and pulmonary edema can worsen, leading to respiratory failure and potentially requiring intubation.
2. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response can lead to cardiac tamponade, which can worsen the patient's cardiac function.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury can worsen, leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and potentially requiring dialysis.
4. Sepsis: The patient's urosepsis can worsen, leading to septic shock and potentially requiring vasopressors and mechanical ventilation.
5. Delirium: The patient's delirium can worsen, leading to increased agitation, confusion, and potentially requiring sedation and mechanical ventilation.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can worsen, leading to bleeding complications and potentially requiring platelet transfusions.
7. Wound complications: The patient's sacral skin breakdown and intertriginous rash can worsen, leading to increased risk of infection and potentially requiring wound care and debridement.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continued IV fluids and vasopressors to maintain a MAP of 60 mmHg
2. Stat ECHO to rule out effusion/tamponade
3. Empiric antibiotics for urosepsis
4. Renally dosed antibiotics for possible urinary tract infection
5. Gentle bolus with lactated Ringer's solution as needed
6. Monitor creatinine and adjust dosing of medications accordingly
7. Continue supplemental oxygen and monitor respiratory status
8. Continue Olanzapine for delirium and consider sitter or ECHO
9. NPO for now, per s/s recs, high risk of aspiration
10. Tylenol standing to avoid medication-induced skin rash

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and improve outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis and congestive heart failure, who was admitted to the ICU for urosepsis and underwent extubation on January 23rd. The patient has developed several medical complications, including:

1. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient has experienced recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which has led to hypotension and required repeated IV fluid boluses.
2. Hypotension: The patient has developed recurrent episodes of hypotension, which has responded to fluid resuscitation, but is a concern given the patient's underlying cardiac condition and risk of pulmonary edema.
3. Renal Failure, Acute: The patient has developed oliguric renal failure, which is likely due to hypoperfusion rather than acute tubular necrosis. The patient has responded to Lasix diuresis and has spontaneously diuresed 1.5L overnight.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due to worsening acidosis and metabolic changes, and was successfully extubated on January 23rd. The patient is currently maintaining oxygen saturation on 2LNC, but has increased respiratory rate noted today.
5. Myocardial Stunning: The patient has developed myocardial stunning, which is likely secondary to intubation, polypharmacy, and prolonged ICU stay.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has developed thrombocytopenia, which is likely due to Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HITS), although the suspicion is low and a specimen was never sent.
7. Wound Complications: The patient has developed sacral skin breakdown and intertriginous rash, which requires close monitoring and treatment.

The patient's current medications include Digoxin, Metoprolol, Olanzapine, and PPI, and the patient is currently DNR/DNI. The patient's care plan includes:

1. Continue Digoxin and hold Metoprolol for hypotension.
2. Monitor ABG and stat ECHO to rule out effusion/tamponade.
3. Start Vanc/Zosyn renally dosed and cover with empiric antibiotics until all Cx data are negative at 48 hours.
4. Gentle bolus with LR prn to maintain MAPs.
5. Monitor creatinine and renally dose all medications.
6. Continue with supplemental O2 and stat ABG.
7. Appreciate Geripsych recommendations and continue Olanzapine.
8. Consider sitter and ECHO.
9. NPO for now, per s/s recommendations, high risk of aspiration.
10. Tylenol standing to avoid MS.
11. Continue holding heparin products for now.

The patient's fluid balance is critical, and the team must carefully monitor the patient's fluid status to avoid pulmonary edema and compromise respiratory status. The patient's cardiac condition and risk of pulmonary edema make it essential to avoid aggressive fluid resuscitation."

   recurrant afib, hypotension
   Active issues remains:
   # hypotension--
            #   Recurrent afib this am, appears cardiogenic, likely
   ischemic in setting of severe AS, though infection possibility given
   off antibx
                 Continues to be senstivie to volume shifts, preload
   dependant but appears clinically asnd by imaging to be
                  Vol up
             Continue dig, hold bb, ecg, cardiac enzymes, echo to reasess
   as, wedge, blood transfuse though may require pressors, a-line
             Family discussions regarding goals of care
             Empiric antibx vanco/zosyn with cx's
             Daily stoke risk low and would not anticoagulate at this time
   given low plts at baseline, though would reassess as clinical picture
   improves as may remain in paroxysmal afib
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) atn from sepsis and
   hypotension now with recurrent hypotension
        Auto-diureses phase of atn with good u/o, creatinine stable
       blood and hemodynamic management as above
        Renal dosing of meds pending further improvement
    >  Delirium
continues to be main issue, large component of sundowning
   at night and altered sleep schedule [**12-25**]  icu, now with recurrent
   hyppotension
         continue low dose zyprexa, haldol prn, re-orient, optimize sleep
   cycle at night
      h2 b d/c and changed to PPI
         limit narcotics
       anticipate extremely slow recovery
   # anemia--transfuse colloid--prbc's given slow drop
   >  hypoxemia--stable on minimal NC o2 though with very tenuous
   respiratory status in setting of hypotension and severe AS, would prob
   not tol central line/lying flat without intubation, continue family
   discussion
   >  Hypernatremia
improving with free water, remains NPO and diuresis,
   >  Sacral abrasions--wound care following, mattress
   >  Nutrition--aspiration risk and agitated so will hold on placing NGT
   NPO given tenuous status
   >  Thrombocytopenia--
       Low ate baseline, though low suspicion of hit, heparin products
   stopped resend hit , Now improved and at prior baseline.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, who presented with left hip pain and hypotension. She was diagnosed with pseudomonal urosepsis, acute kidney injury (ATN), and respiratory failure. The patient has since developed recurrent atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock is likely due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and hypotension in the setting of severe aortic stenosis. This condition requires close monitoring and management with digoxin, beta blockers, and possible pressors.
2. Recurrent atrial fibrillation: The patient's recurrent atrial fibrillation is likely due to cardiogenic shock and may require further management with digoxin, beta blockers, and possible cardioversion.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury (ATN) is likely due to sepsis and hypotension. The patient requires continued fluid management, blood and hemodynamic monitoring, and renal dosing of medications pending further improvement.
4. Delirium: The patient's delirium is a main issue, with a large component of sundowning and altered sleep schedule. The patient requires continued management with low-dose zyprexa, haldol as needed, and re-orientation.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia requires transfusion with colloid and PRBCs given the slow drop in hemoglobin.
6. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is stable on minimal NC oxygen, but the patient's respiratory status is tenuous in the setting of hypotension and severe aortic stenosis. The patient may require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is improving with free water, but the patient remains NPO and diuresis.
8. Sacral abrasions: The patient's sacral abrasions require wound care and mattress management.
9. Nutrition: The patient's nutrition is limited due to aspiration risk and agitation, and the patient may require placement of a nasogastric tube.
10. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is improving, but the patient remains at risk for bleeding, especially with the use of heparin products.
11. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis has resolved, but the patient remains at risk for sepsis due to the presence of a Foley catheter and the patient's underlying medical conditions.
12. Shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock has resolved, but the patient remains at risk for shock due to the patient's underlying medical conditions.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of multiple complex medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, a history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, and currently presenting with recurrent atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and respiratory failure. She was admitted with pseudomonal urosepsis, which has since been resolved. The patient is critically ill, with ongoing issues including:

1. Hypotension: likely cardiogenic, possibly due to ischemia in the setting of severe AS and reduced CO.
2. Recurrent atrial fibrillation: with hypotension and elevated JVD.
3. Acute renal failure (ATN): due to sepsis and hypotension, with auto-diuresis phase and stable creatinine.
4. Delirium: component of sundowning at night and altered sleep schedule.
5. Anemia: requiring transfusion of colloid and PRBCs.
6. Hypoxemia: stable on minimal NC O2, but with tenuous respiratory status.
7. Hypernatremia: improving with free water, remains NPO.
8. Sacral abrasions: wound care following.
9. Nutrition: NPO due to aspiration risk and agitated status.
10. Thrombocytopenia: improved after stopping heparin products.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: further ischemia or infarction due to hypotension and reduced CO.
2. Renal complications: further deterioration of ATN or acute kidney injury (AKI).
3. Respiratory complications: worsening hypoxemia or respiratory failure.
4. Delirium: progression to more severe forms, such as coma or death.
5. Anemia: worsening anemia or bleeding complications.
6. Infection: development of new infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
7. Thrombotic complications: development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
8. Nutritional complications: malnutrition or aspiration pneumonia due to NPO status.
9. Wound complications: infection or delayed healing of sacral abrasions.
10. Cardiovascular complications: further deterioration of AS or cardiac function.

Given the patient's critical condition and ongoing medical issues, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management, including cardiovascular support, renal dosing of medications, and wound care. Family discussions regarding goals of care are also necessary to ensure that the patient's wishes are respected."

    RPR Negative
    Urine & Blood Cx are NGTD
    C. Diff pending
   ECHO [**2163-1-27**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity
   size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
   normal (LVEF 50%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
   aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
   thickened/deformed. There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis.
   Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
   of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The left
   ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the
   tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There is a small pericardial
   effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2162-8-31**], the findings are similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o F with PMHx of severe AS & CHF admitted with urosepsis, s/p
   extubation on [**2163-1-23**], had recurrent A.fib with RVR & hypotension that
   responded to repeat IV fluid boluses, made DNR/DNI on [**1-27**] with
   continued delirium.
   .
   # A.Fib/CV: Pt with severe AS & CHF with EF 45%. Pt naturally diuresed
   >1.5L overnight and developped Afib with RVR c/b hypotension that
   responded to repeated IVF boluses. Concern for aggressive fluid
   resuscitation sending pt into pulm edema, likely to compromise resp
   status. Per family meeting, pt was made DNR/DNI.    Pt developped
   recurrent hypotension overnight required 750cc bolus, BP stable this
   am.
   - continue Digoxin 0.125mg every other day, holding Metoprolol for
   hypotension
   - no plan for systemic anticoagulation currently for intermittent A.Fib
   given other co-morbidities
   .
   #Hypotension: Pt recently completed a 10 day course of Zosyn for
   pseudomonas urosepsis, successfully extubated on [**1-23**]. WBC had trended
   down, afebrile. However, pt developed recurrent hypotension likely
   cardiogenic but will continue to cover with empiric ABx until all Cx
   data negative at 48hrs
   - blood & urine Cx pending
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn renally dosed (follow up am Vanc level) Day 2
   - avoid bolusing IVF if possible
   .
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE: Pt developed oliguric renal failure likely [**12-25**]
   hypoperfusion vs ATN in setting of shock. UOP has dropped in setting of
   hypotension, avoiding volume overload/pulm edema, labs pending this am
   - monitor creatinine
   - renally dose all [**Month/Day (2) 1361**]
   .
   # RESP FAILURE: Pt was intubated on [**1-18**] due to worsening acidosis & MS
   changes.  CXR with effusions R>L & pulm edema.  CT showed ?airspace
   disease in RLL likely chronic changes [**12-25**] to h/o right sided
   pleurodeisis. Pt extubated successfully on [**1-23**] and still maintaining
   sats on 3-4LNC, thought increased resp rate noted this am.  Expiratory
   wheeze noted  on exam today
   - f/u am CXR
   - continue with supplemental O2
   - albuterol nebs prn

   # MS CHANGES: Pt with delirium likely secondary to intubation,
   polypharmacy & prolonged ICU stay.  Sleep/wake cycles now very
   disturbed.  All restraints have been removed, pt has been pulling out

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis and congestive heart failure, admitted with urosepsis. She developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypotension, which responded to repeated IV fluid boluses. The patient was made DNR/DNI due to her poor prognosis and has been experiencing delirium.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (97°F)
* Heart rate: 83 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 94/34 mmHg (71/16 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 5.7-8.5 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 25.8-22.5%
* Platelet count: 58-61 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 2.9-3.1 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.20 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.5 mmol/L

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly dilated, and there is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal, and overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated, and the aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis, and mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened, and there is moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation. There is a small pericardial effusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypotension may lead to pulmonary edema, which can compromise respiratory status.
2. Renal failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further compromise of her overall condition.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is increased, and she has expiratory wheezes on examination, which may indicate respiratory failure.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypotension may lead to cardiovascular instability, which can worsen her overall condition.
5. Infection: The patient's urosepsis may lead to further infection, which can worsen her condition.
6. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further compromise of her overall condition.
7. Wound complications: The patient's sacral skin breakdown and intertriginous rash may lead to wound complications if not managed properly.

Based on the patient's condition, I recommend the following:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with rate control and anticoagulation as needed.
3. Continue to manage the patient's oliguric renal failure with fluid restriction and diuretics as needed.
4. Provide respiratory support as needed to manage the patient's respiratory failure.
5. Manage the patient's cardiovascular instability with vasopressors and inotropes as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's infection and treat accordingly.
7. Manage the patient's delirium with sedation and antipsychotics as needed.
8. Monitor the patient's wound for complications and treat accordingly.
9. Consider consult with geriatrics and palliative care teams to optimize the patient's care and comfort."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

    C. Diff pending
   ECHO [**2163-1-27**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity
   size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
   normal (LVEF 50%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
   aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
   thickened/deformed. There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis.
   Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
   of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The left
   ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the
   tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There is a small pericardial
   effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2162-8-31**], the findings are similar.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted with urosepsis, successfully extubated on day 3, and developed atrial fibrillation (Afib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and hypotension, which responded to repeated IV fluid boluses. The patient was made DNR/DNI with no lines, no pressors, and is currently experiencing recurrent hypotension.

The patient has a complex medical history, including:

1. Severe AS and CHF, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 50%.
2. Urosepsis, treated with empiric antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn).
3. Recurrent Afib with RVR, which responded to IV fluid boluses.
4. Hypotension, likely cardiogenic in origin, requiring close monitoring.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI), with a creatinine level of 3.2 mg/dL and minimal urine output.
6. Respiratory failure, with bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema.
7. Delirium, likely secondary to intubation, polypharmacy, and prolonged ICU stay.
8. Thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 40-60 x 10^9/L.
9. Wound care issues, including sacral skin breakdown and intertriginous rash.

The patient is currently receiving the following treatments:

1. Digoxin 0.125mg every other day, with close monitoring of digoxin levels.
2. Renally dosed antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) for urosepsis.
3. Gentle IV fluid boluses to avoid volume overload.
4. Supplemental oxygen therapy.
5. Albuterol nebs as needed for respiratory symptoms.
6. Olanzapine 2.5mg qam and 5mg qhs for delirium.
7. Pureed nectar thickened feeds with aspiration precautions and monitoring.
8. Tylenol standing for pain management.
9. Heparin products held due to thrombocytopenia.
10. Wound care with kinair mattress, reg position changes, NS cleanser, and aquacel dressing.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or respiratory failure.
3. Renal complications, such as acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
4. Wound complications, such as infection, dehiscence, or delayed healing.
5. Delirium or cognitive decline, which may worsen the patient's overall condition.
6. Thrombocytopenia or bleeding complications, which may require closer monitoring and treatment.
7. Infection or sepsis, which may arise from the patient's urosepsis or other sources.

Close monitoring and management of these potential complications are crucial to ensure the patient's safety and optimal care."

   ECHO [**2163-1-27**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity
   size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
   normal (LVEF 50%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
   aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
   thickened/deformed. There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis.
   Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
   of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The left
   ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the
   tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There is a small pericardial
   effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and hypotension. The patient has a history of anaphylaxis to Cipro, sulfonamides, and levofloxacin, and is currently on empiric antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 83 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 94/34 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild agitation, confusion, and dry mucous membranes. The patient's cardiovascular examination shows a harsh grade 2-3 systolic murmur over the left sternal border, and the patient's abdominal examination shows soft, non-tender, non-distended, and non-necrotic bowel sounds.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.7-8.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.3-25.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 58-61 K/uL. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 22.5%, and creatinine is 2.8-3.1 mg/dL. The patient's troponin-T is 0.20 ng/mL, and lactate is 1.5 mmol/L.

The patient's echocardiogram shows mild left atrial dilation, moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, and normal left ventricular cavity size. The patient's left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). The patient's aortic valve shows severe stenosis, and the mitral valve shows moderate regurgitation.

The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR) and do not intubate (DNI), and the patient is not to receive any lines or pressors.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, or cardiac failure.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, which may indicate respiratory distress or failure.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's dry mucous membranes and abdominal examination may indicate gastrointestinal distress or failure.
4. Infection complications: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate infection.
5. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate kidney failure.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's echocardiogram shows severe aortic stenosis and moderate mitral regurgitation, which may indicate cardiac failure or arrhythmias.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a complex medical history, including severe aortic stenosis, renal cell and ovarian cancer, and a prolonged ICU course.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Urosepsis, which has been resolved with the completion of a 10-day course of Zosyn.
2. Atrial fibrillation with recurrent episodes, which is likely contributing to the patient's hypotension.
3. Acute kidney injury (ATN) due to sepsis and hypotension.
4. Delirium, which is likely related to multiple factors, including the patient's underlying medical conditions, altered sleep schedule, and recurrent hypotension.
5. Respiratory failure, which is being managed with minimal NC O2 and nebs as needed.
6. Hypoxemia, which is stable on minimal NC O2.
7. Hypernatremia, which is improving with free water.
8. Sacral abrasions, which require wound care.
9. Thrombocytopenia, which is stable but low suspicion of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
10. Hip pain, which does not appear to be related to the patient's current infection and has been evaluated with a negative bone scan.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or ischemia, due to the patient's severe aortic stenosis and recurrent atrial fibrillation.
2. Renal failure, which may worsen if the patient's hypotension persists.
3. Respiratory failure, which may worsen if the patient's oxygenation and ventilation status deteriorate.
4. Delirium, which may worsen if the patient's underlying medical conditions and sleep schedule are not optimized.
5. Infection, which may recur if the patient's immune system is compromised.
6. Bleeding, which may occur if the patient's thrombocytopenia worsens or if the patient has a bleeding diathesis.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current conditions, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management to prevent and address potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, history of renal cell and ovarian cancer, who was admitted with left hip pain and hypotension. She was diagnosed with pseudomonal urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), acute kidney injury (ATN), delirium, and respiratory failure. She has undergone treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) antibiotics, and has received gentle IV fluid boluses for hypotension.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.2°C (97.2°F)
* Heart rate: 113 bpm (40-113)
* Blood pressure: 115/42 mmHg (66-123/86)
* Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute (16-45)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Agitated and confused
* Recurrent transient hypotension
* Poor cooperation with examination
* Decreased radial pulses
* Diminished pedal pulses
* Warm skin
* Responds to somnolent movements

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 5.7-10.0 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 58-68 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.8-3.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.20 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.5 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.1 g/dL
* LDH: 124 IU/L

The patient's medical issues include:

* Recurrent atrial fibrillation
* Hypotension
* Acute kidney injury (ATN)
* Delirium
* Respiratory failure
* Hypernatremia
* Sacral abrasions
* Thrombocytopenia
* Pseudomonal urosepsis (resolved)

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Gentle IV fluid boluses for hypotension
* Monitoring of respiratory status
* Autodiuresis and sensitive to volume shifts
* Continue digoxin and hold beta-blockers
* Empiric antibiotics (vancomycin and Zosyn) for 48 hours pending CX data
* Supportive care for acute kidney injury
* Monitoring of creatinine levels
* Continue low-dose zyprexa for delirium
* Optimize sleep cycle at night
* Limit narcotics
* Wound care for sacral abrasions
* Aspiration risk management
* Thrombocytopenia monitoring
* Pseudomonal urosepsis follow-up with new CX data
* Hip pain management with lido patch and tylenol

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiogenic shock due to hypotension
* Ischemia in the setting of severe aortic stenosis and reduced cardiac output
* Infection recurrence despite completion of antibiotics
* Acute kidney injury progression
* Respiratory failure worsening
* Delirium progression
* Thrombocytopenia worsening
* Hypernatremia worsening
* Sacral abrasions infection
* Aspiration risk management failure"
