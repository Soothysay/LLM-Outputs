   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo woman with ESRD on HD with recent line sepsis presenting with
   fever.
   # EKG changes: CP on presentation thought to be [**12-26**] hyperkalemia with
   rate and metabolic related changes resolved w/ sedation and BP control
   with nitro paste. Now CP free x 36 hours but with persistently abnormal
   ST-T changes on EKGs despite HD. Likely demand-related changes in
   setting of fluid shifts post-HD. Less likely ACS as pt asymptomatic and
   downtrending CKs with stable trops.
   - Appreciate Cards c/s; will f/u recs and check TTE today for new WMA.
   - Cont ASA, beta blocker
   - Holding heparin gtt for now in setting of bleed
   - Transfuse for Hct <30
   - CK has peaked. Trops stabilizing in high 0.60
s likely [**12-26**] renal
   failure. No need to cycle enzymes now.
   - F/U am EKG
   - check cholesterol and start statin
   # Dropping Hct: Likely [**12-26**] continued oozing from femoral line insertion
   site in setting of heparin gtt, now discontinued.
   - Compression applied to fem line
   - IR made aware. F/U recs.
   - Maintain active T&S with adequate peripheral access
   - Check post-transfusion hct; transfuse for Hct <30
   # Sepsis/fever: Hypotension resolved; no leukocytosis. On vanc/zosyn
   for empiric tx of infection with most likely source her dialysis
   catheter given her history although cx neg to date; cath pulled and
   temp HD line placed. Concern for osteomyelitis given initial complaint
   of back pain but without tenderness to palpation on exam. Endocarditis
   also possible. DFA neg for influenza. Ucx neg.
   - F/u pending cultures
   - influenza DFA
   - Continue vancomycin;
   - d/c zosyn as cx NGTD x 48 h
   - Evaluate for evidence of endocarditis on TTE being done for WMA
   - Consider MRI spine if above w/u negative
   # Back pain: Osteomyelitis is possibility but pt currently w/o spine
   tenderness.
   - Follow exam; morphine prn
   - Consider MRI if not improving
   # ESRD: MWF dialysis.  HD cath pulled and temp lined placed; dialyzed
   yesterday.
   - F/u renal recs for HD and plan for new HD line (AV fistula

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress:

The patient is a 66-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who presented with fever and line sepsis. She was treated with kayexalate, calcium, D50, and insulin for hyperkalemia, and stress dose steroids were decreased. A femoral HD line was placed, and she underwent HD. The patient was noted to be bleeding from the HD site, and heparin gtt was discontinued. Her hemoglobin (Hct) decreased from 31.3% to 25.3%.

The patient's EKG changes were initially thought to be related to hyperkalemia, but they have persisted despite HD. The cardiologist suspected demand-related changes in the setting of fluid shifts post-HD. The patient's cardiac enzymes (CK and CKMB) have peaked, and her troponin-T levels have stabilized.

The patient has a history of DVT/PE and is on anticoagulation therapy. However, heparin gtt was held in the setting of active bleed. The patient's back pain is a concern, and osteomyelitis or endocarditis are possibilities.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* K: 5.9 mmol/L
* Hct: 25.3%
* WBC: 11.2 x 10^9/L
* Plt: 214 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 6.7 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.60 ng/mL
* Glucose: 128 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Bleeding complications due to the discontinuation of heparin gtt
* Osteomyelitis or endocarditis if the patient's back pain is not managed promptly
* Renal failure if the patient's creatinine levels continue to rise
* Cardiac complications if the patient's EKG changes persist or worsen
* Infection complications if the patient's dialysis catheter is not properly managed
* Hypertension complications if the patient's blood pressure is not managed adequately

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing ASA and beta blocker therapy
* Holding heparin gtt for now and transfusing for Hct <30
* F/u with cardiologist for WMA and TTE
* Evaluating for evidence of endocarditis on TTE
* Considering MRI spine if above w/u is negative
* F/u with renal team for HD and plan for new HD line
* Restarting ACE inhibitor if tolerated
* Monitoring for signs of bleeding complications and adjusting therapy as necessary."

   for empiric tx of infection with most likely source her dialysis
   catheter given her history although cx neg to date; cath pulled and
   temp HD line placed. Concern for osteomyelitis given initial complaint
   of back pain but without tenderness to palpation on exam. Endocarditis
   also possible. DFA neg for influenza. Ucx neg.
   - F/u pending cultures
   - influenza DFA
   - Continue vancomycin; consider d/c zosyn as cx NGTD x 48 h
   - Evaluate for evidence of endocarditis on TTE
   - Consider MRI spine if above w/u negative
   # Back pain: Osteomyelitis is possibility but pt currently w/o spine
   tenderness.
   - Follow exam; morphine prn
   - Consider MRI if not improving
   # ESRD: MWF dialysis.  HD cath pulled and temp lined placed; dialyzed
   yesterday.
   - Monitor lytes q8h in setting of EKG changes
   - F/u renal recs for HD and plan for new HD line (AV fistula
   thrombosed)
   # Diabetes: Cont lantus + ISS
   # Hypertension: BP nomotense
   - Restarted on low-dose beta blocker; uptitrate as tolerated
   - Holding ACE for now but would restart as tolerated as pt has resumed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old woman with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who presented with fever, back pain, and abnormal electrocardiogram (EKG) changes. She has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient's condition has been managed with stress dose steroids, calcium, and insulin for hyperkalemia, and she has undergone hemodialysis with a temporary line. She has also been treated with antibiotics for empiric therapy of infection.

The patient's EKG changes are attributed to demand-related changes in the setting of fluid shifts post-HD, rather than acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient is asymptomatic and has downtrending cardiac enzymes.

However, the patient is experiencing bleeding from the femoral line insertion site, which has been managed by applying compression and discontinuing heparin. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has dropped to 25.3%, and she has been transfused with 2 units of blood.

The patient's sepsis workup is pending, with cultures and DFA tests pending. She has been treated with vancomycin and zosyn for empiric therapy of infection, and consideration is being given to discontinuing zosyn if cultures are negative.

The patient's back pain is a concern for osteomyelitis, and consideration is being given to MRI of the spine if the patient's exam does not improve.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hemorrhagic shock due to ongoing bleeding from the femoral line insertion site.
2. Infection and sepsis due to the patient's underlying ESRD and dialysis catheter.
3. Osteomyelitis or endocarditis due to the patient's back pain and history of DVT/PE.
4. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) despite downtrending cardiac enzymes.
5. Hypotension and cardiovascular instability due to fluid shifts and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Further bleeding complications due to the patient's low Hct and ongoing bleeding from the femoral line insertion site.
7. Infection and sepsis due to the patient's underlying diabetes and hypertension.

The patient's care plan includes continued monitoring of her EKG changes, electrolyte levels, and bleeding status. She will also be evaluated for evidence of endocarditis on TTE and consideration will be given to MRI of the spine if her exam does not improve."
