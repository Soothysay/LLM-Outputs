You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and atrial fibrillation. He underwent a percutaneous pulmonary valve insertion (PVI) procedure, which was complicated by cardiogenic shock, hypotension, and respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is critical, with the following potential medical complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's condition is likely due to demand ischemia or acute coronary syndrome, which requires immediate attention to prevent further deterioration.
2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a marked metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate levels, which may be related to cardiogenic shock or other underlying conditions.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation to assist his respiratory status, and there is a risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia: The patient has experienced episodes of tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia, which may be related to ischemia or other cardiac conditions.
5. Volume overload: The patient appears to be volume overloaded, which may contribute to his respiratory failure and other complications.
6. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's abdominal CT scan did not reveal any evidence of intra-abdominal process, but there is a risk of developing abdominal compartment syndrome due to his abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.

The patient's laboratory results indicate the following:

* Elevated cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, and Troponin-T)
* Abnormal liver function tests (ALT, AST, and Alk Phos)
* Elevated lactate levels
* Abnormal electrolyte levels (Ca++, Mg++, and PO4)

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Repeat TTE to assess cardiac function
* Continue to cycle EKG, cardiac enzymes, CVO2, and lactate levels
* Place a central venous line to monitor CVP and CVO2
* Continue antibiotics and monitor for sepsis
* Manage the patient's volume status with CVVH and aim for a target blood volume of 150/hr
* Continue hyperventilation to assist acid-base status
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider the need for tracheostomy
* Consider the need for surgical intervention to address any underlying conditions

In summary, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple complex medical conditions, and his condition requires immediate attention and management to prevent further deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities and complications. The patient has been diagnosed with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is currently on hemodialysis. They also have atrial fibrillation, acute respiratory failure, and hypotension.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.5°F)
* Heart rate: 143 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 101/74 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 28 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and sedatives. They are also receiving respiratory support through a ventilator.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 24.6 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 42.9%
* Platelet count: 217 K/uL
* Creatinine: 4.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 18 mEq/L
* Sodium: 138 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.5 mEq/L
* Glucose: 163 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: [image002.jpg]

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their critical condition, but they are noted to have a normal skin tone and a normal respiratory rate.

The patient's medical history is significant for ESRD, atrial fibrillation, and acute respiratory failure. They have also had multiple episodes of hypotension and have required vasopressor support.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Septicemia due to the presence of multiple lines and the risk of infection
* Pneumonia or respiratory failure due to the patient's respiratory status and the risk of aspiration
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's atrial fibrillation and the risk of cardiac arrest
* Renal failure due to the patient's ESRD and the risk of further kidney damage
* Infections due to the patient's immunosuppressed state and the risk of sepsis
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis and the risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, AF
   who underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was
   transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension, and is now
   transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic
   shock.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Unclear etiology.  Differential diagnosis
   includes cardiogenic shock possibly from MI, PE, or decompensated CHF
   in the setting of volume overload.  No evidence of hemorrhage with
   stable Hct and no tamponade on echo. Septic shock also in the
   differential, but the rapid onset and temporal relation to post op make
   this less likely.  Episodes of poly and monoporphic Vtach and
   increasing troponin lead one to cardiogenic shock due to ischemic
   event.  Tachycardia and hypoxia in setting of recent surgery indicate
   possible PE, however no clots on LENIs.
   - continue cvvh at 150
 200  cc/hr fluid removal
   - cycle enzymes for nadir (although troponin leak to be expected s/p
   PVI)
   - serial EKGs, monitor on tele
   - continue levophed/vasporessin though would consider dopamine
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl for now
   - f/u blood, urine, and urine cx
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT
   thought secondary to [**3-5**] ischemia, given magnesium and started on
   amiodarone.  Then had atrial tachycardia and is now s/p cardioversion
   with reversion into sinus for a short time before spontaneously
   reverting back to tachycardia.
   - continue amio gtt
   - f/u EP recs
   - would trend lytes, aggressive repletion
   - can start beta blocker when BP stabilizes
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - treat pain
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis:  Secondary to profoundly elevated lactate in
   setting of hypoperfusion and now drifting downward.  Abd CT neg for
   bowel ischemia and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 542**] following.  Lactate improving.
   - trend lacate with ABGs q6 hr
   - support blood pressure and perfusion
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely primarily secondary to volume
   overload/pulmonary edema.  Oxygenation improving with diuresis with
   CVVH.  Would also consider PE with INR 1.7 on admission, not on
   coumadin b/c of GI bleeds.
   - management of heart failure as above
   - continue to wean vent settings
   - will continue hyperventilation to assist acid-base status
   .
   # Gastroparesis:  No bowel sounds.  NG lavage revealed stagnant gastric
   contents.  Medications not likely to be absorbed PO right now.
   -- NPO including medications
   .
   # elevated liver enzymes: likely shock liver from poor perfusion.
   - hold statin
   - watch for encephalopathy
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG: holding bb and asa while npo
   .
   # Afib:  Currently in afib and s/p PVI on [**2154-5-14**] with complications as
   described above.
   - continue aspirin, amio
   - Patient not anticoagulated given history of GIB
   - EP reccs
   .
   # ESRD on HD:
   - Continue phoslo and nephrocaps (when able to take PO)
   - continue cvvh at goal 150-200 ml/hr fluid removal
   .
   # Hypothyroid
   - Continue levothyroxine (when able to take PO)
   .
   #FEN: NPO pending bowel function return
   #Access: Groin line via sheath, R arterial line, R PIV, Right
   subclavian HD catheter
   #PPX PPI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's tachycardia, hypotension, and increasing troponin levels suggest cardiogenic shock, possibly due to an ischemic event, PE, or decompensated CHF.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support requirements, including mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy, indicate respiratory failure. The likely cause is volume overload/pulmonary edema, but PE cannot be ruled out.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's lactate levels are elevated, indicating hypoperfusion. The metabolic acidosis is likely secondary to this, but it is improving with CVVH and diuresis.
4. Gastroparesis: The patient's lack of bowel sounds and stagnant gastric contents suggest gastroparesis, making it difficult to absorb medications orally.
5. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient's elevated liver enzymes, including ALT and AST, are likely due to shock liver from poor perfusion.
6. Renal failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on hemodialysis.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which requires continued levothyroxine therapy.
8. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient has AFib, which was not well-controlled post-procedure and has led to complications.
9. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Although the patient's LENIs did not show evidence of clot, PE remains a possibility, especially given the patient's history of CAD and AFib.
10. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels suggest the possibility of sepsis, although the rapid onset and temporal relation to post-op make this less likely.

To manage these complications, the patient will require:

* Continued CVVH and diuresis to manage fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances
* Monitoring of cardiac enzymes and troponin levels to assess for ischemic events
* Serial EKGs to monitor for arrhythmias
* Aggressive repletion of electrolytes, including magnesium and potassium
* Management of pain and respiratory support as needed
* Close monitoring of liver enzymes and lactate levels to assess for signs of shock liver or sepsis
* Continued anticoagulation therapy to prevent PE and DVT
* Consideration of dopamine or other vasopressors to support blood pressure
* Weaning of vent settings and hyperventilation to assist acid-base status
* Nutritional support, including glycemic control and consideration of parenteral nutrition if necessary
* Close communication with the patient's family and healthcare team to ensure coordinated care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities. The patient's chief complaint is hypotension, and they are currently receiving various medications to manage their condition.

The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 109/53 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. They are also experiencing atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate renal failure, with a creatinine level of 3.4 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 157 mg/dL. They also have elevated liver enzymes, with an alanine transaminase (ALT) level of 2524 IU/L and an aspartate transaminase (AST) level of 5311 IU/L.

The patient's imaging studies reveal that the tip of the endotracheal tube is projecting 9.8 cm above the carina, and they have a CXR showing no relevant change in appearance of the lung parenchyma or cardiac silhouette.

The patient's microbiology results indicate that they have a urine culture positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and a blood culture pending.

Based on the patient's condition, potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's positive MRSA culture and pending blood culture results indicate a high risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and BUN levels indicate acute kidney injury, which can worsen their hypotension and increase their risk of cardiovascular complications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 99% indicate a high risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypotension increase their risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and stroke.
5. Infections: The patient's positive MRSA culture and pending blood culture results indicate a high risk of infections, which can lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and death.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and abdominal tenderness increase their risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and perforation.

In summary, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities, and their condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, AF
   who underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was
   transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension, and is now
   transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic
   shock.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Unclear etiology.  Differential diagnosis
   includes cardiogenic shock possibly from MI, PE, or decompensated CHF
   in the setting of volume overload.  No evidence of hemorrhage with
   stable Hct and no tamponade on echo. Septic shock also in the
   differential, but the rapid onset and temporal relation to post op make
   this less likely.  Episodes of poly and monoporphic Vtach and
   increasing troponin lead one to conclude cardiogenic shock due to
   ischemic event.  Tachycardia and hypoxia in setting of recent surgery
   indicate possible PE, however no clots on LENIs.
   - continue cvvh at 150
 200  cc/hr fluid removal
   - cycle enzymes for nadir
   - serial EKGs, monitor on tele
   - continue levophed/vasporessin though would consider dopamine
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl for now
   - f/u blood, urine, and urine cx
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT
   thought secondary to [**3-5**] ischemia, given magnesium and started on
   amiodarone.  Then had atrial tachycardia and is now s/p cardioversion
   with reversion into sinus for a short time before spontaneously
   reverting back to tachycardia.
   - continue amio gtt
   - f/u EP recs
   - would trend lytes, aggressive repletion
   - can start beta blocker when BP stabilizes
 hold for today
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - treat pain
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Secondary to profoundly elevated lactate in
   setting of hypoperfusion and now drifting downward.  Abd CT neg for
   bowel ischemia and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 542**] following.  Lactate improving.
   - trend lacate with ABGs q6 hr
   - support blood pressure and perfusion
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely primarily secondary to volume
   overload/pulmonary edema.  Oxygenation improving with diuresis with
   CVVH.  Would also consider PE with INR 1.7 on admission, not on
   coumadin b/c of GI bleeds.
   - management of heart failure as above
   - continue to wean vent settings reduce rate and reduce PEEP
   - slow down hyperventilation given improvement with acid-base status
   .
   # Gastroparesis:  No bowel sounds.  NG lavage revealed stagnant gastric
   contents.  Medications not likely to be absorbed PO right now likely
   secondary to ileus.
   -- NPO including medications
   .
   # elevated liver enzymes: likely shock liver from poor perfusion.
   - hold statin
   - watch for encephalopathy
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG: holding bb and asa while npo
   .
   # Afib:  Currently in afib and s/p PVI on [**2154-5-14**] with complications as
   described above.
   - continue aspirin, amio
   - Patient not anticoagulated given history of GIB
   - EP recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, AF
   who underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was
   transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension, and is now
   transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic
   shock.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Unclear etiology.  Differential diagnosis
   includes cardiogenic shock possibly from MI, PE, or decompensated CHF
   in the setting of volume overload.  No evidence of hemorrhage with
   stable Hct and no tamponade on echo. Septic shock also in the
   differential, but the rapid onset and temporal relation to post op make
   this less likely.  Episodes of poly and monoporphic Vtach and
   increasing troponin lead one to conclude cardiogenic shock due to
   ischemic event.  Tachycardia and hypoxia in setting of recent surgery
   indicate possible PE, however no clots on LENIs.
   - continue cvvh at 150
 200  cc/hr fluid removal
   - cycle enzymes for nadir
   - serial EKGs, monitor on tele
   - continue levophed/vasporessin though would consider dopamine
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl for now
   - f/u blood, urine, and urine cx
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT
   thought secondary to [**3-5**] ischemia, given magnesium and started on
   amiodarone.  Then had atrial tachycardia and is now s/p cardioversion
   with reversion into sinus for a short time before spontaneously
   reverting back to tachycardia.
   - continue amio gtt
   - f/u EP recs
   - would trend lytes, aggressive repletion
   - can start beta blocker when BP stabilizes
 hold for today
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - treat pain
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Secondary to profoundly elevated lactate in
   setting of hypoperfusion and now drifting downward.  Abd CT neg for
   bowel ischemia and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 542**] following.  Lactate improving.
   - trend lacate with ABGs q6 hr
   - support blood pressure and perfusion
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely primarily secondary to volume
   overload/pulmonary edema.  Oxygenation improving with diuresis with
   CVVH.  Would also consider PE with INR 1.7 on admission, not on
   coumadin b/c of GI bleeds.
   - management of heart failure as above
   - continue to wean vent settings reduce rate and reduce PEEP
   - slow down hyperventilation given improvement with acid-base status
   .
   # Gastroparesis:  No bowel sounds.  NG lavage revealed stagnant gastric
   contents.  Medications not likely to be absorbed PO right now likely
   secondary to ileus.
   -- NPO including medications
   .
   # elevated liver enzymes: likely shock liver from poor perfusion.
   - hold statin

   # Afib:  Currently in afib and s/p PVI on [**2154-5-14**] with complications as

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and a recent pulmonary vein isolation procedure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 109/53 mmHg, which is considered hypotensive.
* Cardiac arrhythmia: The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has had episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, and his oxygenation is improving with diuresis and CVVH.
* Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a lactate level of 3.1 mmol/L, which is elevated, but improving.
* Renal failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on hemodialysis.
* Gastroparesis: The patient has no bowel sounds and stagnant gastric contents on NG lavage.
* ESRD on HD: The patient is on hemodialysis and has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Hypothyroid: The patient is taking levothyroxine.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and cardiac arrhythmia may indicate cardiogenic shock, which can lead to organ failure and death.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or death.
* Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen, leading to organ failure and death.
* Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances and organ failure.
* Gastroparesis: The patient's gastroparesis may lead to malnutrition and dehydration.
* Infections: The patient's immunosuppressed state and indwelling catheters make him susceptible to infections, including sepsis and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
* Bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and anticoagulation therapy make him susceptible to bleeding complications.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* CVVH at 150-200 ml/hr fluid removal
* Serial EKGs and monitor on tele
* Continue levophed/vasopressin and consider dopamine
* Continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl for now
* F/u blood, urine, and urine cx
* Trend lytes and aggressive repletion
* Consider beta blocker when BP stabilizes
* Trend cardiac enzymes
* Treat pain
* Continue phoslo and nephrocaps when able to take PO
* Continue levothyroxine when able to take PO
* NPO pending bowel function return"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, AF
   who underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was
   transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension, and is now
   transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic
   shock.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Most likely cardiogenic shock. Differential
   diagnosis includes cardiogenic shock possibly from MI, PE, or
   decompensated CHF in the setting of volume overload.  No evidence of
   hemorrhage with stable Hct and no tamponade on echo. Septic shock also
   in the differential, but the rapid onset and temporal relation to post
   op make this less likely.  Episodes of poly and monoporphic Vtach and
   increasing troponin lead one to conclude cardiogenic shock due to
   ischemic event.  Tachycardia and hypoxia in setting of recent surgery
   indicate possible PE, however no clots on LENIs.
   - continue cvvh at 150
 200  cc/hr fluid removal
   - cycle enzymes for nadir
   - serial EKGs, monitor on tele
   - continue levophed/vasporessin for now titrate to maps >65
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl for now
   - f/u blood, urine, and urine cx
   - obtain endotracheal sputum prior to extubation
   - Check c diff given ileus, consider KUB
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT
   thought secondary to [**3-5**] ischemia, given magnesium and started on
   amiodarone.  Then had atrial tachycardia and is now s/p cardioversion
   with reversion into sinus for a short time before spontaneously
   reverting back to tachycardia.
   - continue amio gtt
   - f/u EP recs
   - would trend lytes, aggressive repletion
   - can start beta blocker when BP stabilizes
 hold for today
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - treat pain
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely primarily secondary to volume
   overload/pulmonary edema.  Oxygenation improving with diuresis with
   CVVH.  Would also consider PE with INR 1.7 on admission, not on
   coumadin b/c of GI bleeds.
   - goal to extubate today, no need to readjust tube
   - management of heart failure as above
   - continue to wean vent settings reduce rate and reduce PEEP
   - slow down hyperventilation given improvement with acid-base status
   # Metabolic acidosis: Secondary to profoundly elevated lactate in
   setting of hypoperfusion and now drifting downward.  Abd CT neg for
   bowel ischemia and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 542**] following.  Lactate improving.
   - trend lacate with ABGs q6 hr
   - support blood pressure and perfusion
   .
   # Gastroparesis:  No bowel sounds.  NG lavage revealed stagnant gastric
   contents.  Medications not likely to be absorbed PO right now likely
   secondary to ileus.
   -- NPO including medications
   - Consider KUB per above
   .
   # elevated liver enzymes: likely shock liver from poor perfusion.
   - hold statin
   - watch for encephalopathy
   - monitor INR (2.8 now)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG: holding bb and asa while npo
   .
   # Afib:  Currently in afib and s/p PVI on [**2154-5-14**] with complications as

   - continue aspirin, amio

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia suggest cardiogenic shock, which can lead to multi-organ failure and increased mortality.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload and pulmonary edema. Prolonged mechanical ventilation and respiratory failure can lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia and lung injury.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is secondary to hypoperfusion and lactate production. This can lead to further organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
4. Gastroparesis: The patient's gastroparesis is likely secondary to ileus and poor gut motility. This can lead to malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of aspiration pneumonia.
5. Shock liver: The patient's elevated liver enzymes are likely secondary to shock liver from poor perfusion. This can lead to further liver damage and increased risk of encephalopathy.
6. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate production suggest sepsis, which can lead to further organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of recent surgery and immobility make them at high risk for DVT. This can lead to pulmonary embolism and increased mortality.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient's history of recent surgery and critical illness make them at high risk for stress ulcer. This can lead to bleeding and further complications.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and respiratory failure make them at high risk for VAP. This can lead to further respiratory failure and increased mortality.
10. Catheter-related complications: The patient's multiple catheters and lines make them at high risk for catheter-related complications, such as infection and bleeding.

To address these potential complications, the patient requires aggressive management of their cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, and metabolic acidosis. This includes continuous monitoring of their vital signs, cardiac enzymes, and laboratory results. The patient also requires close monitoring for signs of sepsis, DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. Additionally, the patient's family should be educated on the patient's condition and treatment plan to ensure proper care and support."

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, AF
   who underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was
   transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension, and is now
   transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic
   shock.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Most likely cardiogenic shock. Differential
   diagnosis includes cardiogenic shock possibly from MI, PE, or
   decompensated CHF in the setting of volume overload.  No evidence of
   hemorrhage with stable Hct and no tamponade on echo. Septic shock also
   in the differential, but the rapid onset and temporal relation to post
   op make this less likely.  Episodes of poly and monoporphic Vtach and
   increasing troponin lead one to conclude cardiogenic shock due to
   ischemic event.  Tachycardia and hypoxia in setting of recent surgery
   indicate possible PE, however no clots on LENIs.
   - continue cvvh at 150
 200  cc/hr fluid removal
   - cycle enzymes for nadir
   - serial EKGs, monitor on tele
   - continue levophed/vasporessin for now titrate to maps >65
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl for now
   - f/u blood, urine, and urine cx
   - obtain endotracheal sputum prior to extubation
   - Check c diff given ileus, consider KUB
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT
   thought secondary to [**3-5**] ischemia, given magnesium and started on
   amiodarone.  Then had atrial tachycardia and is now s/p cardioversion
   with reversion into sinus for a short time before spontaneously
   reverting back to tachycardia.
   - continue amio gtt
   - f/u EP recs
   - would trend lytes, aggressive repletion
   - can start beta blocker when BP stabilizes
 hold for today
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - treat pain
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely primarily secondary to volume
   overload/pulmonary edema.  Oxygenation improving with diuresis with
   CVVH.  Would also consider PE with INR 1.7 on admission, not on
   coumadin b/c of GI bleeds.
   - goal to extubate today, no need to readjust tube
   - management of heart failure as above
   - continue to wean vent settings reduce rate and reduce PEEP
   - slow down hyperventilation given improvement with acid-base status
   # Metabolic acidosis: Secondary to profoundly elevated lactate in
   setting of hypoperfusion and now drifting downward.  Abd CT neg for
   bowel ischemia and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 542**] following.  Lactate improving.
   - trend lacate with ABGs q6 hr
   - support blood pressure and perfusion
   .
   # Gastroparesis:  No bowel sounds.  NG lavage revealed stagnant gastric
   contents.  Medications not likely to be absorbed PO right now likely
   secondary to ileus.
   -- NPO including medications
   - Consider KUB per above
   .
   # elevated liver enzymes: likely shock liver from poor perfusion.
   - hold statin
   - watch for encephalopathy
   - monitor INR (2.8 now)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG: holding bb and asa while npo
   .
   # Afib:  Currently in afib and s/p PVI on [**2154-5-14**] with complications as
   described above.
   - continue aspirin, amio
   - Patient not anticoagulated given history of GIB
   - EP recs
   .
   # ESRD on HD:
   - Continue phoslo and nephrocaps (when able to take PO)
   - continue cvvh at goal 150-200 ml/hr fluid removal
   .
   # Hypothyroid
   - Continue levothyroxine (when able to take PO)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition: CCU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and atrial fibrillation (AF). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypotension and is now being transferred to the coronary care unit (CCU) for further management of cardiogenic shock.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including cardioversion, vasopressin infusion, and continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). His hemodynamic monitoring shows a heart rate of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure of 109/53 mmHg, and a cardiac index of 2.4 L/min/m2.

The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 252 mmHg. His oxygenation is improving with diuresis and CVVH. He is also experiencing metabolic acidosis, with a lactate level of 3.1 mmol/L.

The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, likely due to shock liver from poor perfusion. His coagulation profile is abnormal, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.8.

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is not anticoagulated. He is also experiencing gastroparesis, with no bowel sounds and stagnant gastric contents.

The patient's medication regimen includes vasopressin, norepinephrine, and amiodarone for cardiogenic shock, as well as antibiotics for suspected sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock is likely due to ischemic event, and further interventions may be necessary to improve cardiac function.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and further interventions may be necessary to improve oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely due to poor perfusion and hypoxia, and further interventions may be necessary to improve lactate clearance and acid-base balance.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, and further interventions may be necessary to improve liver function and prevent further liver damage.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, and further interventions may be necessary to improve coagulation function and prevent bleeding complications.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and may be at risk for further bleeding complications.
7. Infection: The patient has a suspected sepsis and may be at risk for further infection complications.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications requiring ongoing monitoring and interventions to improve his condition."

   Chief Complaint: Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD,
   renal cell carcinoma, GIB, AAA s/p repair, AF who underwent elective
   pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was transferred to the MICU
   post-procedure for hypotension, and is now transferred to the CCU for
   further management of likely cardiogenic shock.
   24 Hour Events:
 INVASIVE VENTILATION - STOP [**2154-5-17**] 04:36 PM
 PICC LINE - START [**2154-5-17**] 10:36 PM
   - discussed with renal: concerned that he has citrate toxicity, because
   total Ca is high while iCal is low. They want to switch to heparin as
   the anticoagulant. Agreed this was okay, with understanding we will
   have to watch HCT closely give prior chronic GI bleeding.
   - Extubation after level of arousal increased
   - SVT and hypotension after hypotension - responded to 2.5 mg verapamil
   - pressure actually came up so repeated
   - CXR report not final and scheduled not yet performed at 18:50
   - ID approval for vancomycin done - this is empiric Rx for hypotension
   - Called PICC team and they are going to try to come by soon, or worst
   case in a.m., then we can remove sheaths (likely with EP in a.m.)
   - Updated family
   - Repeat EKG tonight, now slower after verapamil.
   - CVVH filter clotted and replaced
   - PICC placed late evening - confirm placement then okay to pull
   sheaths - EP will likely do this.

   Per renal: evidence of citrate toxicity given low ionized calcium
   despite calcium boluses
   - change anticoagulation to heparin
   - Continue phoslo and nephrocaps (when able to take PO)
   - continue cvvh at goal 150-200 ml/hr fluid removal and increase as bp
   tolerates
   - daily vanc troughs

   # Respiratory failure: Likely primarily secondary to volume
   overload/pulmonary edema.  Oxygenation improved with diuresis with CVVH
   and pt extubated yesterday.
   - management of heart failure as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 71-year-old male with a history of CAD, ESRD on HD, AAA repair, AF, and renal cell carcinoma, underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**] and was transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension. He is now transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic shock.

The patient has experienced multiple complications, including:

* Hypotension/shock, likely due to cardiogenic shock from decompensated CHF and volume overload
* Tachycardia, potentially secondary to ischemia, treated with magnesium, amiodarone, and cardioversion
* ESRD on HD, with evidence of citrate toxicity and low ionized calcium levels
* Respiratory failure, likely secondary to volume overload and pulmonary edema
* Metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to hypoperfusion and lactate elevation
* Gastroparesis, with no bowel sounds and stagnant gastric contents
* Elevated liver enzymes, likely due to shock liver
* CAD s/p CABG, with holding of beta blockers and aspirin
* AFib, with PVI on [**2154-5-14**] and complications
* Hypothyroidism, with continuation of levothyroxine

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia suggest a high risk of cardiogenic shock, which could worsen if not managed promptly.
2. Citrate toxicity: The patient's low ionized calcium levels and evidence of citrate toxicity from CVVH may lead to further complications, such as arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not managed effectively, leading to respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen if not managed promptly, leading to further complications, such as arrhythmias and organ dysfunction.
5. Gastroparesis: The patient's gastroparesis may lead to further complications, such as malnutrition, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver dysfunction, which could worsen if not managed promptly.
7. AFib: The patient's AFib may lead to further complications, such as stroke, heart failure, and arrhythmias.

Recommendations:

1. Continue CVVH at 150-200 mL/hr fluid removal and increase as tolerated.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and troponin levels closely.
3. Continue amiodarone and magnesium therapy for tachycardia.
4. Manage the patient's respiratory failure with diuresis and CVVH.
5. Monitor the patient's metabolic acidosis and lactate levels closely.
6. Consider KUB and NG lavage to evaluate gastroparesis.
7. Monitor the patient's liver enzymes and INR levels closely.
8. Continue levothyroxine therapy for hypothyroidism.
9. Monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust therapy accordingly.
10. Consider consultation with a cardiologist and intensivist to optimize management."

   Chief Complaint: Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD,
   renal cell carcinoma, GIB, AAA s/p repair, AF who underwent elective
   pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was transferred to the MICU
   post-procedure for hypotension, and is now transferred to the CCU for
   further management of likely cardiogenic shock.
   24 Hour Events:
 INVASIVE VENTILATION - STOP [**2154-5-17**] 04:36 PM
 PICC LINE - START [**2154-5-17**] 10:36 PM
   - discussed with renal: concerned that he has citrate toxicity, because
   total Ca is high while iCal is low. They want to switch to heparin as
   the anticoagulant. Agreed this was okay, with understanding we will
   have to watch HCT closely give prior chronic GI bleeding.
   - Extubation after level of arousal increased
   - SVT and hypotension after hypotension - responded to 2.5 mg verapamil
   - pressure actually came up so repeated
   - CXR report not final and scheduled not yet performed at 18:50
   - ID approval for vancomycin done - this is empiric Rx for hypotension
   - Called PICC team and they are going to try to come by soon, or worst
   case in a.m., then we can remove sheaths (likely with EP in a.m.)
   - Updated family
   - Repeat EKG tonight, now slower after verapamil.
   - CVVH filter clotted and replaced
   - PICC placed late evening - confirm placement then okay to pull
   sheaths - EP will likely do this.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD,
   renal cell carcinoma, GIB, AAA s/p repair, AF who underwent elective
   pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was transferred to the MICU
   post-procedure for hypotension, and is now transferred to the CCU for
   further management of likely cardiogenic shock.
   24 Hour Events:
 INVASIVE VENTILATION - STOP [**2154-5-17**] 04:36 PM
 PICC LINE - START [**2154-5-17**] 10:36 PM
   - discussed with renal: concerned that he has citrate toxicity, because
   total Ca is high while iCal is low. They want to switch to heparin as
   the anticoagulant. Agreed this was okay, with understanding we will
   have to watch HCT closely give prior chronic GI bleeding.
   - Extubation after level of arousal increased
   - SVT and hypotension after hypotension - responded to 2.5 mg verapamil
   - pressure actually came up so repeated
   - CXR report not final and scheduled not yet performed at 18:50
   - ID approval for vancomycin done - this is empiric Rx for hypotension
   - Called PICC team and they are going to try to come by soon, or worst
   case in a.m., then we can remove sheaths (likely with EP in a.m.)
   - Updated family
   - Repeat EKG tonight, now slower after verapamil.
   - CVVH filter clotted and replaced
   - PICC placed late evening - confirm placement then okay to pull
   sheaths - EP will likely do this.

Summary:

The patient, a 71-year-old male with a complex medical history, was transferred to the CCU from the MICU for further management of likely cardiogenic shock. He underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**] and was intubated due to hypotension. The patient has a history of CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, AF, and GIB. He has been experiencing tachycardia, hypotension, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's condition is likely due to decompensated CHF, volume overload, and ischemic event, which can lead to further complications such as cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and cardiac failure.
2. Citrate toxicity: The patient's low ionized calcium levels despite calcium boluses suggest citrate toxicity, which can lead to cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and muscle weakness.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload and pulmonary edema, which can lead to further complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's elevated lactate levels can lead to further complications such as cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and organ failure.
5. Gastroparesis: The patient's ileus and lack of bowel sounds can lead to further complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, and sepsis.
6. ESRD on HD: The patient's ESRD on HD can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and cardiovascular disease.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism can lead to further complications such as fatigue, weakness, and cognitive impairment.
8. Delirium: The patient's delirium can lead to further complications such as falls, injuries, and increased risk of mortality.

Recommendations:

1. Continue CVVH at 150-200 ml/hr fluid removal and increase as BP tolerates.
2. Change anticoagulation to heparin and continue phoslo and nephrocaps (when able to take PO).
3. Continue amiodarone and trend lytes, aggressive repletion.
4. Start beta blocker when BP stabilizes.
5. Trend cardiac enzymes and treat pain.
6. Continue soft restraints until improves.
7. Continue olanzapine PRN.
8. Manage heart failure as above.
9. Trend lactate with ABGs Q day and support blood pressure and perfusion.
10. Consider KUB and hold statin.
11. Monitor INR and watch for encephalopathy.
12. Continue aspirin, amio, and EP recs.
13. Continue levothyroxine (when able to take PO).

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, AF
   who underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was
   transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension, and is now
   transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic
   shock.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Most likely cardiogenic shock from decompensated
   CHF in the setting of volume overload.  Septic shock still in the
   differential given hypotension, but less likely.  Patient had episodes
   of poly and monoporphic Vtach and increasing troponin likely from
   cardiogenic shock due to ischemic event.
   - talk with renal for course of CVVH given length of stay fluid removal
   is 5 L negative (about what he received following his ablation
   procedure) and he should be nearing euvolemia. Will continue 150
 200
   cc/hr fluid removal for now
   - BP better when rates in the low 100s (versus rate control in 70s
   yesterday)
   - serial EKGs, monitor on tele
   - continue levophed/vasporessin for now and wean as tolerated
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - f/u blood, urine, and urine cx
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT
   thought secondary to [**3-5**] ischemia, given magnesium and started on
   amiodarone.  Then had atrial tachycardia and is now s/p cardioversion x
   2 with reversion back into atrial tachycardia vs a fib vs atrial
   flutter.
   - continue amio gtt
   - hold off on more verapamil for now, given hemodynamically stable
   - f/u EP recs
   - pm lytes, aggressive repletion
   - can start beta blocker when BP stabilizes
 hold for today
   - treat pain
   .
   # ESRD on HD:  Currently on CVVH with rate of 150 cc/hr fluid removal.
   Per renal: evidence of citrate toxicity given low ionized calcium
   despite calcium boluses.
   - as above, will discuss with renal the appropriate time to switch back
   to HD now that most of the extra fluid has been removed (although this
   will likely be after his pressors are weaned)
   - change anticoagulation to heparin secondary to citrate toxicity
   - Continue phoslo and nephrocaps (when able to take PO)
   - decrease cvvh  goal o 100 - 150 ml/hr fluid removal to aid weaning
   pressors
   - daily vanc troughs
   .
   # Altered mental status: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to weaning of sedation
   medications now s/p extubation, ICU delirium, hepatic encephalopathy.
   Pt received zyprexa last night with little effect.  Currently in 4
   point restraints for protection.
   - continue soft restraints until improves
   - may need to try haldol insteat of zyprexa if this happens again as
   zyprexa was not very effective
   .
   # Groin sheaths: still in place.  Plan to pull now that has PICC.  Will
   need to hold heparin/CVVH for 6 hrs post.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely primarily secondary to volume
   overload/pulmonary edema.  Oxygenation improved with diuresis with CVVH
   and pt extubated yesterday.
   - management of heart failure as above
   # Metabolic acidosis: Secondary to profoundly elevated lactate in
   setting of hypoperfusion and now drifting downward.  Abd CT neg for
   bowel ischemia and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 542**] following.  Lactate improving.
   - trend lacate with ABGs Q day
   - support blood pressure and perfusion
   .
   # Gastroparesis:  No bowel sounds.  NG lavage revealed stagnant gastric
   contents initially.  Medications not likely to be absorbed PO right now
   likely secondary to ileus.  Abdomen soft and less distended inidating
   improvement.
   -- NPO including medications
   -- anticipate improvement over the next day as pt sedation wears off
   and mental status improves, but will consider NGT tomorrow if needed
   (defer for now given aspiration risk)
   .
   # elevated liver enzymes: likely shock liver from poor perfusion.
   - hold statin
   - watch for encephalopathy
   - monitor INR (2.8 now)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG: holding bb and asa while npo
   .
   # Afib:  Currently in afib alternating with atrial tach or flutter, s/p
   PVI on [**2154-5-14**] with complications as described above.
   - continue aspirin, amio
   - Patient not anticoagulated given history of GIB, although on hep for
   CVVH
   - EP recs
   .
   # Hypothyroid
   - Continue levothyroxine (when able to take PO)
   .
   #FEN: NPO pending bowel function return
   #Access: Groin line via sheath (to be pulled today now that has PICC),
   R arterial line, R PIV, Right subclavian HD catheter, right PICC
   #PPX PPI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD,
   renal cell carcinoma, GIB, AAA s/p repair, AF who underwent elective
   pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was transferred to the MICU
   post-procedure for hypotension, and is now transferred to the CCU for
   further management of likely cardiogenic shock.
   24 Hour Events:
 INVASIVE VENTILATION - STOP [**2154-5-17**] 04:36 PM
 PICC LINE - START [**2154-5-17**] 10:36 PM
   - discussed with renal: concerned that he has citrate toxicity, because
   total Ca is high while iCal is low. They want to switch to heparin as
   the anticoagulant. Agreed this was okay, with understanding we will
   have to watch HCT closely give prior chronic GI bleeding.
   - Extubation after level of arousal increased
   - SVT and hypotension after hypotension - responded to 2.5 mg verapamil
   - pressure actually came up so repeated
   - CXR report not final and scheduled not yet performed at 18:50
   - ID approval for vancomycin done - this is empiric Rx for hypotension
   - Called PICC team and they are going to try to come by soon, or worst
   case in a.m., then we can remove sheaths (likely with EP in a.m.)
   - Updated family
   - Repeat EKG tonight, now slower after verapamil.
   - CVVH filter clotted and replaced
   - PICC placed late evening - confirm placement then okay to pull
   sheaths - EP will likely do this.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 71-year-old male, is currently in the Cardiac Care Unit (CCU) after being transferred from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to likely cardiogenic shock. The patient has a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD) post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), renal cell carcinoma, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Hypotension/shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) with volume overload. Septic shock is still in the differential diagnosis, but less likely.
2. Tachycardia: The patient has had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) thought to be secondary to ischemia. Magnesium and amiodarone have been started, and the patient has been cardioverted twice with reversion back into atrial tachycardia or atrial fibrillation (AF).
3. ESRD on HD: The patient is currently on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) with a rate of 150 cc/hr fluid removal. There is evidence of citrate toxicity, and the anticoagulation has been switched to heparin.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to weaning of sedation medications, ICU delirium, and hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Groin sheaths: The patient has groin sheaths in place, which will be removed once the PICC line is confirmed.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient likely has respiratory failure secondary to volume overload and pulmonary edema. Oxygenation has improved with diuresis and CVVH, and the patient has been extubated.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis secondary to elevated lactate levels in the setting of hypoperfusion.
8. Gastroparesis: The patient has gastroparesis with stagnant gastric contents and no bowel sounds.
9. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient has elevated liver enzymes likely secondary to shock liver from poor perfusion.
10. CAD s/p CABG: The patient has CAD with a history of CABG.
11. Afib: The patient has AF with complications from pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) on [**2154-5-14**].

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock can worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or death.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock can progress, leading to multi-organ failure and death.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to respiratory arrest or death.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis can worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction and death.
5. Gastroparesis: The patient's gastroparesis can worsen, leading to further gastrointestinal complications and potential sepsis.
6. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic encephalopathy can worsen, leading to further cognitive decline and potential death.
7. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure can worsen, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and potential death.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of his cardiogenic shock, sepsis, respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, gastroparesis, and other potential complications."

   Chief Complaint: Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD,
   renal cell carcinoma, GIB, AAA s/p repair, AF who underwent elective
   pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was transferred to the MICU
   post-procedure for hypotension, and is now transferred to the CCU for
   further management of likely cardiogenic shock.
   24 Hour Events:
 INVASIVE VENTILATION - STOP [**2154-5-17**] 04:36 PM
 PICC LINE - START [**2154-5-17**] 10:36 PM
   - discussed with renal: concerned that he has citrate toxicity, because
   total Ca is high while iCal is low. They want to switch to heparin as
   the anticoagulant. Agreed this was okay, with understanding we will
   have to watch HCT closely give prior chronic GI bleeding.
   - Extubation after level of arousal increased
   - SVT and hypotension after hypotension - responded to 2.5 mg verapamil
   - pressure actually came up so repeated
   - CXR report not final and scheduled not yet performed at 18:50
   - ID approval for vancomycin done - this is empiric Rx for hypotension
   - Called PICC team and they are going to try to come by soon, or worst
   case in a.m., then we can remove sheaths (likely with EP in a.m.)
   - Updated family
   - Repeat EKG tonight, now slower after verapamil.
   - CVVH filter clotted and replaced
   - PICC placed late evening - confirm placement then okay to pull
   sheaths - EP will likely do this.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD,
   renal cell carcinoma, GIB, AAA s/p repair, AF who underwent elective
   pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was transferred to the MICU
   post-procedure for hypotension, and is now transferred to the CCU for
   further management of likely cardiogenic shock.
   24 Hour Events:
 INVASIVE VENTILATION - STOP [**2154-5-17**] 04:36 PM
 PICC LINE - START [**2154-5-17**] 10:36 PM
   - discussed with renal: concerned that he has citrate toxicity, because
   total Ca is high while iCal is low. They want to switch to heparin as
   the anticoagulant. Agreed this was okay, with understanding we will
   have to watch HCT closely give prior chronic GI bleeding.
   - Extubation after level of arousal increased
   - SVT and hypotension after hypotension - responded to 2.5 mg verapamil
   - pressure actually came up so repeated
   - CXR report not final and scheduled not yet performed at 18:50
   - ID approval for vancomycin done - this is empiric Rx for hypotension
   - Called PICC team and they are going to try to come by soon, or worst
   case in a.m., then we can remove sheaths (likely with EP in a.m.)
   - Updated family
   - Repeat EKG tonight, now slower after verapamil.
   - CVVH filter clotted and replaced
   - PICC placed late evening - confirm placement then okay to pull
   sheaths - EP will likely do this.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, AF
   who underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was
   transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension, and is now
   transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic
   shock.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Most likely cardiogenic shock from decompensated
   CHF in the setting of volume overload.  Septic shock still in the
   differential given hypotension, but less likely.  Patient had episodes
   of poly and monoporphic Vtach and increasing troponin likely from
   cardiogenic shock due to ischemic event.
   - talk with renal for course of CVVH given length of stay fluid removal
   is 5 L negative (about what he received following his ablation
   procedure) and he should be nearing euvolemia. Will continue 150
 200
   cc/hr fluid removal for now
   - BP better when rates in the low 100s (versus rate control in 70s
   yesterday)
   - serial EKGs, monitor on tele
   - continue levophed/vasporessin for now and wean as tolerated
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - f/u blood, urine, and urine cx
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT
   thought secondary to [**3-5**] ischemia, given magnesium and started on
   amiodarone.  Then had atrial tachycardia and is now s/p cardioversion x
   2 with reversion back into atrial tachycardia vs a fib vs atrial
   flutter.
   - continue amio gtt
   - hold off on more verapamil for now, given hemodynamically stable
   - f/u EP recs
   - pm lytes, aggressive repletion
   - can start beta blocker when BP stabilizes
 hold for today
   - treat pain
   .
   # ESRD on HD:  Currently on CVVH with rate of 150 cc/hr fluid removal.
   Per renal: evidence of citrate toxicity given low ionized calcium
   despite calcium boluses.
   - as above, will discuss with renal the appropriate time to switch back
   to HD now that most of the extra fluid has been removed (although this
   will likely be after his pressors are weaned)
   - change anticoagulation to heparin secondary to citrate toxicity
   - Continue phoslo and nephrocaps (when able to take PO)
   - decrease cvvh  goal o 100 - 150 ml/hr fluid removal to aid weaning
   pressors
   - daily vanc troughs
   .
   # Altered mental status: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to weaning of sedation
   medications now s/p extubation, ICU delirium, hepatic encephalopathy.
   Pt received zyprexa last night with little effect.  Currently in 4
   point restraints for protection.
   - continue soft restraints until improves
   - may need to try haldol insteat of zyprexa if this happens again as
   zyprexa was not very effective
   .
   # Groin sheaths: still in place.  Plan to pull now that has PICC.  Will
   need to hold heparin/CVVH for 6 hrs post.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely primarily secondary to volume
   overload/pulmonary edema.  Oxygenation improved with diuresis with CVVH
   and pt extubated yesterday.
   - management of heart failure as above
   # Metabolic acidosis: Secondary to profoundly elevated lactate in
   setting of hypoperfusion and now drifting downward.  Abd CT neg for
   bowel ischemia and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 542**] following.  Lactate improving.
   - trend lacate with ABGs Q day
   - support blood pressure and perfusion
   .
   # Gastroparesis:  No bowel sounds.  NG lavage revealed stagnant gastric
   contents initially.  Medications not likely to be absorbed PO right now
   likely secondary to ileus.  Abdomen soft and less distended inidating
   improvement.
   -- NPO including medications
   -- anticipate improvement over the next day as pt sedation wears off
   and mental status improves, but will consider NGT tomorrow if needed
   (defer for now given aspiration risk)
   .
   # elevated liver enzymes: likely shock liver from poor perfusion.
   - hold statin
   - watch for encephalopathy
   - monitor INR (2.8 now)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG: holding bb and asa while npo
   .
   # Afib:  Currently in afib alternating with atrial tach or flutter, s/p
   PVI on [**2154-5-14**] with complications as described above.
   - continue aspirin, amio
   - Patient not anticoagulated given history of GIB, although on hep for
   CVVH
   - EP recs
   .
   # Hypothyroid
   - Continue levothyroxine (when able to take PO)
   .
   #FEN: NPO pending bowel function return
   #Access: Groin line via sheath (to be pulled today now that has PICC),
   R arterial line, R PIV, Right subclavian HD catheter, right PICC

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 71-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, renal cell carcinoma, gastrointestinal bleeding, and atrial fibrillation, underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on May 14th. He was transferred to the MICU post-procedure due to hypotension and is now transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic shock.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 35.9°C (96.7°F)
* Heart rate: 101 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 89/60 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 93%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient has several medical complications, including:

* Hypotension/shock: likely due to cardiogenic shock from decompensated heart failure, possibly exacerbated by volume overload
* Tachycardia: secondary to ischemia, atrial tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation
* ESRD on HD: currently on CVVH with a rate of 150 cc/hr fluid removal, with evidence of citrate toxicity
* Altered mental status: possibly due to weaning of sedation medications, ICU delirium, and hepatic encephalopathy
* Groin sheaths: still in place, with plans to pull once the PICC line is removed
* Respiratory failure: likely secondary to volume overload/pulmonary edema
* Metabolic acidosis: secondary to profoundly elevated lactate levels
* Gastroparesis: no bowel sounds, with stagnant gastric contents initially
* Elevated liver enzymes: likely due to shock liver from poor perfusion
* CAD s/p CABG: holding beta blockers and aspirin while NPO
* Afib: currently in atrial fibrillation, alternating with atrial tachycardia or flutter, with complications from PVI on May 14th

The patient is being managed with various medications, including:

* Vasopressors: levophed and vasopressin
* Anticoagulation: heparin for CVVH, with plans to switch to heparin once the patient is euvolemic
* Anti-arrhythmic medications: amiodarone, verapamil, and beta blockers
* Sedation medications: zyprexa and haldol
* Pain management: Percocet
* Antihypertensive medications: norepinephrine and vasopressin
* Anticoagulant medications: warfarin and aspirin

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 12.3 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 39.6%
* White blood cell count: 13.2 K/uL
* Platelet count: 141 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.3 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 24 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.1 mmol/L
* Troponin-T: 3.39 ng/mL
* Liver enzymes: elevated ALT and AST levels
* Electrolytes: potassium 4.5 mEq/L, magnesium 2.0 mg/dL, phosphorus 3.4 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: shows a right PICC line entering the superior vena cava, but the distal tip is not confidently visualized due to overlap with a pre-existing right internal jugular dialysis catheter
* Abdominal CT: shows a soft and less distended abdomen, with no evidence of bowel ischemia

The patient's plan is to:

* Continue CVVH with a rate of 150 cc/hr fluid removal
* Wean vasopressors and sedation medications as tolerated
* Monitor and manage the patient's cardiac status, including arrhythmias and hypotension
* Monitor and manage the patient's respiratory status, including oxygenation and ventilation
* Monitor and manage the patient's metabolic acidosis and liver enzymes
* Monitor and manage the patient's gastroparesis and bowel function
* Continue anticoagulation therapy with heparin and aspirin
* Continue antihypertensive therapy with norepinephrine and vasopressin
* Continue pain management with Percocet
* Continue anticoagulant therapy with warfarin and aspirin

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Cardiogenic shock
* Sepsis
* Respiratory failure
* Metabolic acidosis
* Gastroparesis
* Elevated liver enzymes
* CAD s/p CABG
* Afib
* DVT
* VAP
* Stress ulcer

The patient's family has been updated on the patient's condition and plan, and the patient's code status is full code."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, AF
   who underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was
   transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension, and is now
   transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic
   shock.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Most likely cardiogenic shock from decompensated
   CHF in the setting of volume overload.  Septic shock still in the
   differential given hypotension, but less likely.  Patient had episodes
   of poly and monoporphic Vtach and increasing troponin likely from
   cardiogenic shock due to ischemic event. Iatrogenic hypovolemia is also
   a possibility. Sepsis less likely given white  count trending down and
   no growth in cultures and no obvious source.
   - Will discuss with renal whether pt needs some fluid repletion via
   CVVH (4L neg negative length of stay)
   - BP better when rates in the low 100s (versus rate control in 70s
   yesterday)
   - serial EKGs, monitor on tele
   - continue levophed/vasporessin for now and wean as tolerated
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - f/u blood, urine, and urine cx
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT
   thought secondary to [**3-5**] ischemia, given magnesium and started on
   amiodarone.  Then had atrial tachycardia and is now s/p cardioversion x
   2 with reversion back into atrial tachycardia vs a fib vs atrial
   flutter.
   - continue amio gtt
   - hold off on more verapamil for now, given hemodynamically stable
   - f/u EP recs
   - pm lytes, aggressive repletion
   - can start beta blocker when BP stabilizes
 hold for today
   - treat pain
   .
   # ESRD on HD:  Currently on CVVH with rate of 150 cc/hr fluid removal.
   Per renal: evidence of citrate toxicity given low ionized calcium
   despite calcium boluses.
   - as above, will discuss with renal the appropriate time to switch back
   to HD now that most of the extra fluid has been removed (although this
   will likely be after his pressors are weaned)
   - change anticoagulation to heparin secondary to citrate toxicity
   - Continue phoslo and nephrocaps (when able to take PO)
   - decrease cvvh  goal o 100 - 150 ml/hr fluid removal to aid weaning
   pressors
   - daily vanc troughs
   .
   # Altered mental status: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to weaning of sedation
   medications now s/p extubation, ICU delirium, hepatic encephalopathy.
   Pt received zyprexa last night with little effect.  Currently in 4
   point restraints for protection.
   - continue soft restraints until improves
   - may need to try haldol insteat of zyprexa if this happens again as
   zyprexa was not very effective
   .
   # Groin sheaths: still in place.  Plan to pull now that has PICC.  Will
   need to hold heparin/CVVH for 6 hrs post.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Likely primarily secondary to volume overload/pulmonary
   edema.  Oxygenation improved with diuresis with CVVH and pt extubated
   on Friday.
   - management of heart failure as above
   # Metabolic acidosis: Secondary to profoundly elevated lactate in
   setting of hypoperfusion and now drifting downward.  Abd CT neg for
   bowel ischemia and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 542**] following.  Lactate improving.
   - trend lacate with ABGs Q day
   - support blood pressure and perfusion
   .
   # Gastroparesis:  No bowel sounds.  NG lavage revealed stagnant gastric
   contents initially.  Medications not likely to be absorbed PO right now
   likely secondary to ileus.  Abdomen soft and less distended inidating
   improvement.
   -- NPO including medications
   -- anticipate improvement over the next day as pt sedation wears off
   and mental status improves, but will consider NGT tomorrow if needed
   (defer for now given aspiration risk)
   .
   # elevated liver enzymes: improvement given improving INR. likely shock
   liver from poor perfusion.
   - hold statin
   - watch for encephalopathy
   - monitor INR (1.7 now)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG: holding bb and asa while npo
   .
   # Afib:  Currently in afib alternating with atrial tach or flutter, s/p
   PVI on [**2154-5-14**] with complications as described above.
   - continue aspirin, amio
   - Patient not anticoagulated given history of GIB, although on hep for
   CVVH
   - EP recs
   .
   # Hypothyroid
   - Continue levothyroxine (when able to take PO)
   .
   #FEN: NPO pending bowel function return
   #Access: Groin line via sheath (to be pulled today now that has PICC),
   R arterial line, R PIV, Right subclavian HD catheter, right PICC
   #PPX Pneumaboots, PPI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 83/56 mmHg, which is a significant drop from his normal pressure. The patient is receiving vasopressor support to maintain blood pressure.
* Cardiogenic shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to decompensated CHF, volume overload, and possible ischemic event. The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating possible myocardial infarction.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to volume overload and pulmonary edema.
* Renal failure: The patient is on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD).
* Delirium and confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium and confusion, likely secondary to weaning off sedation medications and possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient is in atrial fibrillation, which is a complication of the pulmonary vein isolation procedure performed on May 14th.
* Metabolic acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to hypoperfusion and lactate elevation.
* Gastroparesis: The patient has gastroparesis, which is likely secondary to ileus and poor bowel function.
* Elevated liver enzymes: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, likely secondary to shock liver from poor perfusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is at risk for further cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
* Renal failure: The patient is at risk for further renal failure, including acute kidney injury (AKI).
* Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis, particularly if there is a source of infection that is not yet identified.
* Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is at risk for further hepatic encephalopathy, particularly if his liver function continues to deteriorate.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly if his gastroparesis worsens.
* Cardiac tamponade: The patient is at risk for cardiac tamponade, particularly if his atrial fibrillation is not adequately managed.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to address these potential complications and prevent further deterioration of his condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with hypotension, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure. They have a history of renal failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and delirium/confusion. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a blood pressure of 83/56 mmHg, heart rate of 102 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 97%. They are receiving multiple medications, including vasopressin, amiodarone, and norepinephrine, to manage their blood pressure and cardiac rhythm.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs, such as the kidneys, liver, and brain.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, which may worsen their hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, which may exacerbate their hypotension and increase their risk of acute kidney injury.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's cardiac rhythm is abnormal, which may increase their risk of cardiac arrhythmias, embolic events, and cardiac failure.
5. Delirium/confusion: The patient's mental status is altered, which may impair their ability to communicate effectively and increase their risk of falls, respiratory compromise, and other complications.
6. Infection: The patient's respiratory culture and urine culture are pending, and they have a history of MRSA colonization, which may increase their risk of infection.
7. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy, which may increase their risk of bleeding complications, such as hematuria, hematemesis, or other bleeding events.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, AF
   who underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was
   transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension, and is now
   transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic
   shock.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Most likely cardiogenic shock from decompensated
   CHF in the setting of volume overload.  Septic shock still in the
   differential given hypotension, but less likely.  Patient had episodes
   of poly and monoporphic Vtach and increasing troponin likely from
   cardiogenic shock due to ischemic event. Hypovolemia is also a
   possibility given 4L negative from ultrafiltration however less likely
   given he was given 4L during the procedure. Sepsis less likely given
   white count trending down and no growth in cultures and no obvious
   source.
   - Will discuss with renal whether pt needs some fluid repletion via
   CVVH (4L neg negative length of stay)
   - BP better when rates in the low 100s (versus rate control in 70s
   yesterday)
   - serial EKGs, monitor on tele
   - continue levophed/vasporessin for now and wean as tolerated
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - f/u blood, urine, and urine cx
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT
   thought secondary to [**3-5**] ischemia, given magnesium and started on
   amiodarone.  Then had atrial tachycardia and is now s/p cardioversion x
   2 with reversion back into atrial tachycardia vs a fib vs atrial
   flutter.
   - continue amio gtt
   - hold off on more verapamil for now, given hemodynamically stable
   - f/u EP recs
   - pm lytes, aggressive repletion
   - can start beta blocker when BP stabilizes
 hold for today
   - treat pain
   .
   # ESRD on HD:  Currently on CVVH with rate of 150 cc/hr fluid removal.
   Per renal: evidence of citrate toxicity given low ionized calcium
   despite calcium boluses.
   - as above, will discuss with renal the appropriate time to switch back
   to HD now that most of the extra fluid has been removed (although this
   will likely be after his pressors are weaned)
   - change anticoagulation to heparin secondary to citrate toxicity
   - Continue phoslo and nephrocaps (when able to take PO)
   - decrease cvvh  goal o 100 - 150 ml/hr fluid removal to aid weaning
   pressors
   - daily vanc troughs
   .
   # Altered mental status: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to weaning of sedation
   medications now s/p extubation, ICU delirium, hepatic encephalopathy.
   Pt received zyprexa last night with little effect.  Currently in 4
   point restraints for protection.
   - continue soft restraints until improves
   - may need to try haldol insteat of zyprexa if this happens again as
   zyprexa was not very effective
   .
   # Groin sheaths: still in place.  Plan to pull now that has PICC.  Will
   need to hold heparin/CVVH for 6 hrs post.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Likely primarily secondary to volume overload/pulmonary
   edema.  Oxygenation improved with diuresis with CVVH and pt extubated
   on Friday.
   - management of heart failure as above
   # Metabolic acidosis: Secondary to profoundly elevated lactate in
   setting of hypoperfusion and now drifting downward.  Abd CT neg for
   bowel ischemia and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 542**] following.  Lactate improving.
   - trend lacate with ABGs Q day
   - support blood pressure and perfusion
   .
   # Gastroparesis:  No bowel sounds.  NG lavage revealed stagnant gastric
   contents initially.  Medications not likely to be absorbed PO right now
   likely secondary to ileus.  Abdomen soft and less distended inidating
   improvement.
   -- NPO including medications
   -- anticipate improvement over the next day as pt sedation wears off
   and mental status improves, but will consider NGT tomorrow if needed
   (defer for now given aspiration risk)
   .
   # elevated liver enzymes: improvement given improving INR. likely shock
   liver from poor perfusion.
   - hold statin
   - watch for encephalopathy
   - monitor INR (1.7 now)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG: holding bb and asa while npo
   .
   # Afib:  Currently in afib alternating with atrial tach or flutter, s/p
   PVI on [**2154-5-14**] with complications as described above.
   - continue aspirin, amio
   - Patient not anticoagulated given history of GIB, although on hep for
   CVVH
   - EP recs
   .
   # Hypothyroid
   - Continue levothyroxine (when able to take PO)
   .
   #FEN: NPO pending bowel function return
   #Access: Groin line via sheath (to be pulled today now that has PICC),
   R arterial line, R PIV, Right subclavian HD catheter, right PICC
   #PPX Pneumaboots, PPI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, AF
   who underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was
   transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension, and is now
   transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic
   shock.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Most likely cardiogenic shock from decompensated
   CHF in the setting of volume overload.  Septic shock still in the
   differential given hypotension, but less likely.  Patient had episodes
   of poly and monoporphic Vtach and increasing troponin likely from
   cardiogenic shock due to ischemic event. Hypovolemia is also a
   possibility given 4L negative from ultrafiltration however less likely
   given he was given 4L during the procedure. Sepsis less likely given
   white count trending down and no growth in cultures and no obvious
   source.
   - Will discuss with renal whether pt needs some fluid repletion via
   CVVH (4L neg negative length of stay)
   - BP better when rates in the low 100s (versus rate control in 70s
   yesterday)
   - serial EKGs, monitor on tele
   - continue levophed/vasporessin for now and wean as tolerated
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - f/u blood, urine, and urine cx
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT
   thought secondary to [**3-5**] ischemia, given magnesium and started on
   amiodarone.  Then had atrial tachycardia and is now s/p cardioversion x
   2 with reversion back into atrial tachycardia vs a fib vs atrial
   flutter.
   - continue amio gtt
   - hold off on more verapamil for now, given hemodynamically stable
   - f/u EP recs
   - pm lytes, aggressive repletion
   - can start beta blocker when BP stabilizes
 hold for today
   - treat pain
   .
   # ESRD on HD:  Currently on CVVH with rate of 150 cc/hr fluid removal.
   Per renal: evidence of citrate toxicity given low ionized calcium
   despite calcium boluses.
   - as above, will discuss with renal the appropriate time to switch back
   to HD now that most of the extra fluid has been removed (although this
   will likely be after his pressors are weaned)
   - change anticoagulation to heparin secondary to citrate toxicity
   - Continue phoslo and nephrocaps (when able to take PO)
   - decrease cvvh  goal o 100 - 150 ml/hr fluid removal to aid weaning
   pressors
   - daily vanc troughs
   .
   # Altered mental status: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to weaning of sedation
   medications now s/p extubation, ICU delirium, hepatic encephalopathy.
   Pt received zyprexa last night with little effect.  Currently in 4
   point restraints for protection.
   - continue soft restraints until improves
   - may need to try haldol insteat of zyprexa if this happens again as
   zyprexa was not very effective
   .
   # Groin sheaths: still in place.  Plan to pull now that has PICC.  Will
   need to hold heparin/CVVH for 6 hrs post.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Likely primarily secondary to volume overload/pulmonary
   edema.  Oxygenation improved with diuresis with CVVH and pt extubated
   on Friday.
   - management of heart failure as above
   # Metabolic acidosis: Secondary to profoundly elevated lactate in
   setting of hypoperfusion and now drifting downward.  Abd CT neg for
   bowel ischemia and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 542**] following.  Lactate improving.
   - trend lacate with ABGs Q day
   - support blood pressure and perfusion
   .
   # Gastroparesis:  No bowel sounds.  NG lavage revealed stagnant gastric
   contents initially.  Medications not likely to be absorbed PO right now
   likely secondary to ileus.  Abdomen soft and less distended inidating
   improvement.
   -- NPO including medications
   -- anticipate improvement over the next day as pt sedation wears off
   and mental status improves, but will consider NGT tomorrow if needed
   (defer for now given aspiration risk)
   .
   # elevated liver enzymes: improvement given improving INR. likely shock
   liver from poor perfusion.
   - hold statin
   - watch for encephalopathy
   - monitor INR (1.7 now)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG: holding bb and asa while npo
   .
   # Afib:  Currently in afib alternating with atrial tach or flutter, s/p
   PVI on [**2154-5-14**] with complications as described above.
   - continue aspirin, amio
   - Patient not anticoagulated given history of GIB, although on hep for
   CVVH
   - EP recs
   .
   # Hypothyroid
   - Continue levothyroxine (when able to take PO)

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to hypotension, which is likely secondary to cardiogenic shock from decompensated congestive heart failure. The patient's heart rate is elevated, and he has had episodes of polymorphic and monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.

The patient's respiratory status is also compromised, with acute respiratory failure not related to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is oxygen-dependent and has a high inspired oxygen fraction.

The patient's renal function is compromised, with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis. He is currently on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) with a rate of 150 cc/hr fluid removal.

The patient's mental status is altered, with delirium and confusion, which may be secondary to weaning of sedation medications, ICU delirium, or hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient has several medications, including vasopressin, norepinephrine, and amiodarone, which are being used to manage his cardiogenic shock and arrhythmias. He is also receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, to cover potential sepsis.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock is likely to continue if his heart failure is not adequately managed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen if his respiratory status is not improved.
3. Renal failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease may worsen if his renal function is not adequately managed.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may worsen if his sedation medications are not carefully managed.
5. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis if his infections are not adequately managed.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding if his coagulopathy is not adequately managed.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if his thyroid function is not adequately managed.

To mitigate these risks, the patient's cardiogenic shock and arrhythmias should be carefully managed, and his respiratory status should be closely monitored. His renal function should be closely monitored, and his medications should be carefully managed to minimize the risk of adverse effects. His mental status should be closely monitored, and his sedation medications should be carefully managed to minimize the risk of delirium."

   Patient was undergoing a KUB to assess his abdominal pain, during this
   film the patient became unresponsive and pulseless with electrical
   activity. CPR was immediately initiated with several rounds of
   epinephrine and bicarbonate given. The patient regained his pulse 3
   times and each time lost his pulse and went into PEA. The patient at
   one point had a wide complex tachycardia and was shocked to no affect.
   The patient was started on a dopamine and epinephrine drip in addition
   to his vasopressin and norepinephrine. The patient also received
   heparin bolus + gtt for empiric PE tx, bicarb for empiric acidosis and
   hyperkalemia tx, empiric insulin/glucagon/calcium for empiric
   hyperkalemia treatment. EKG revealed ST elevations in aVR and V1, V2
   consistent with global ischemia. Code STEMI was called and pt was to be
   taken to the cath lab until he lost his pulse again. No reversible
   cause could be identified. After the third set of CPR of over 90
   minutes of a code, the patient remained pulseless and the code was

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 980**] is a 71M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, AAA s/p repair, AF
   who underwent elective pulmonary vein isolation on [**2154-5-14**], was
   transferred to the MICU post-procedure for hypotension, and is now
   transferred to the CCU for further management of likely cardiogenic
   shock.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Most likely cardiogenic shock from decompensated
   CHF in the setting of volume overload.  Septic shock still in the
   differential given hypotension, but less likely.  Patient had episodes
   of poly and monoporphic Vtach and increasing troponin likely from
   cardiogenic shock due to ischemic event. Hypovolemia is also a
   possibility given 4L negative from ultrafiltration however less likely
   given he was given 4L during the procedure. Sepsis less likely given
   white count trending down and no growth in cultures and no obvious
   source.
   - Will discuss with renal whether pt needs some fluid repletion via
   CVVH (4L neg negative length of stay)
   - BP better when rates in the low 100s (versus rate control in 70s
   yesterday)
   - serial EKGs, monitor on tele
   - continue levophed/vasporessin for now and wean as tolerated
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - f/u blood, urine, and urine cx
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Had multiple episodes of monomorphic and polymorphic VT
   thought secondary to [**3-5**] ischemia, given magnesium and started on
   amiodarone.  Then had atrial tachycardia and is now s/p cardioversion x
   2 with reversion back into atrial tachycardia vs a fib vs atrial
   flutter.
   - continue amio gtt
   - hold off on more verapamil for now, given hemodynamically stable
   - f/u EP recs
   - pm lytes, aggressive repletion
   - can start beta blocker when BP stabilizes
 hold for today
   - treat pain
   .
   # ESRD on HD:  Currently on CVVH with rate of 150 cc/hr fluid removal.
   Per renal: evidence of citrate toxicity given low ionized calcium
   despite calcium boluses.
   - as above, will discuss with renal the appropriate time to switch back
   to HD now that most of the extra fluid has been removed (although this
   will likely be after his pressors are weaned)
   - change anticoagulation to heparin secondary to citrate toxicity
   - Continue phoslo and nephrocaps (when able to take PO)
   - decrease cvvh  goal o 100 - 150 ml/hr fluid removal to aid weaning
   pressors
   - daily vanc troughs
   .
   # Altered mental status: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to weaning of sedation
   medications now s/p extubation, ICU delirium, hepatic encephalopathy.
   Pt received zyprexa last night with little effect.  Currently in 4
   point restraints for protection.
   - continue soft restraints until improves
   - may need to try haldol insteat of zyprexa if this happens again as
   zyprexa was not very effective
   .
   # Groin sheaths: still in place.  Plan to pull now that has PICC.  Will
   need to hold heparin/CVVH for 6 hrs post.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Likely primarily secondary to volume overload/pulmonary
   edema.  Oxygenation improved with diuresis with CVVH and pt extubated
   on Friday.
   - management of heart failure as above
   # Metabolic acidosis: Secondary to profoundly elevated lactate in
   setting of hypoperfusion and now drifting downward.  Abd CT neg for
   bowel ischemia and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 542**] following.  Lactate improving.
   - trend lacate with ABGs Q day
   - support blood pressure and perfusion
   .
   # Gastroparesis:  No bowel sounds.  NG lavage revealed stagnant gastric
   contents initially.  Medications not likely to be absorbed PO right now
   likely secondary to ileus.  Abdomen soft and less distended inidating
   improvement.
   -- NPO including medications
   -- anticipate improvement over the next day as pt sedation wears off
   and mental status improves, but will consider NGT tomorrow if needed
   (defer for now given aspiration risk)
   .
   # elevated liver enzymes: improvement given improving INR. likely shock
   liver from poor perfusion.
   - hold statin
   - watch for encephalopathy
   - monitor INR (1.7 now)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG: holding bb and asa while npo
   .
   # Afib:  Currently in afib alternating with atrial tach or flutter, s/p
   PVI on [**2154-5-14**] with complications as described above.
   - continue aspirin, amio
   - Patient not anticoagulated given history of GIB, although on hep for
   CVVH
   - EP recs
   .
   # Hypothyroid
   - Continue levothyroxine (when able to take PO)

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, post-coronary artery bypass grafting, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypotension and underwent pulmonary vein isolation procedure. He is currently on vasopressors and has a low blood pressure, likely due to cardiogenic shock from decompensated heart failure. He has also developed atrial fibrillation and is at risk for cardiac arrest.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low blood pressure and decreased cardiac output may lead to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to respiratory arrest or death.
3. Sepsis: The patient's low white blood cell count and lack of growth in cultures may indicate a low risk of sepsis, but the possibility of sepsis cannot be ruled out entirely.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and possible liver dysfunction may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may worsen if not properly managed, leading to hemorrhagic shock or death.
6. Renal failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease and current use of hemodialysis may lead to further renal dysfunction or failure.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if not properly managed, leading to decreased metabolic function and potentially life-threatening complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue vasopressors as needed to maintain blood pressure.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust therapy accordingly.
3. Manage the patient's respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's liver function and adjust therapy accordingly.
5. Manage the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding with endoscopy and medication as needed.
6. Continue hemodialysis as prescribed and monitor the patient's renal function.
7. Monitor the patient's thyroid function and adjust therapy accordingly."
