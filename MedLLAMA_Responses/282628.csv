You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS) and acute anemia secondary to blood loss. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and has been experiencing low-grade fevers, blood and urine cultures were sent. A lumbar puncture was performed, and EEG was ordered. Imaging studies revealed a right lower lobe pulmonary embolism, and a possible pyelonephritis. The patient has a PICC line in place and is receiving diltiazem infusions. His vital signs are stable, but he is tachycardic and has a low hemoglobin level of 19%. His physical examination reveals no acute distress, but he is nonresponsive except to painful stimuli.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's low-grade fevers and altered mental status may indicate the presence of an infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's right lower lobe pulmonary embolism could worsen and cause respiratory distress or even death.
3. Pyelonephritis: The patient's possible pyelonephritis could lead to sepsis, acute kidney injury, or even kidney failure.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation could worsen and lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even stroke.
5. Anemia: The patient's acute anemia could worsen and lead to respiratory distress, cardiac failure, or even death.
6. Infection: The patient's PICC line and other invasive devices could increase his risk of infection.
7. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and possible bleeding could worsen and lead to hypovolemic shock.
8. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could worsen and lead to delirium, which could increase his risk of falls, injury, or even death."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o F w/ multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls in setting of
   severe peripheral neuropathy who now p/w acute on chronic subdural
   hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.  Transferred back to
   MICU after becoming non responsive, febrile and in afib with [**Year (4 digits) 1978**].
   .
   # AMS - unclear etiology, CT of head negative for change in SDH and
   patient moving all 4 extremities.  Would continue to monitor CTs for
   changes as needed.  Neuro consult, checking dilantin levels and EEG.
   Could be secondary to infection as patient is febrile.  Has known
   pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be c.diff in the setting of broad spectrum abx.  Maybe
   meningitis, although LP initially negative.  Could be drug effect,
   although not on any sedating meds now except oxybutinin.  Is
   hemodynamically stable and should have adequate perfusion to brain.
   Recent MRI showed nonobstruction flow.
   - f/u pan cultures of blood, urine, stool
   - f/u LP cultures
   - EEG today to rule out subclinical seizures
   - MRI to rule out stroke
   - LENIs and CTA neg for clots
   - hold oxybutinin
   - follow up neuro recs
   - could be delirium in setting of pain
   .
   # Fever - fever today, culturing, is immunecompromised secondary to
   pulse steroids for MM.  Being treated for HAP and aspiration pneumonia
   with broad spectrum vanco, cefepime, flagyl.  Not covering ESBLs.  Also
   not covering fungal infections.
   - f/u cultures
   - continue current abx
 see if infection declares itself
   - consider DVT as source of fever, f/u LENIs
   - hemodynamically stable, does not appear septic
   .
   # RUQ pain - unclear etiology, patient is post cholecystectomy so not
   gallbladder pain.  Could be rib fracture v. pleural pain v. colitis vs.
   pneumonia pain.
   - f/u abdominal ultrasound
 negative
   - CT abd and pelvis did not show pathology which could account for
   pain; consider possible obstructing stone as cause as it would not be
   well visualized on CT
   - no abx for now
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma: Neurosurgery following, no acute change from OSH
   imaging, no changes in CT today.
   - transfuse plt's with goal of >80, plt 96 now
   - INR 1.5, s/p Vit K treatment
   - continue dilantin at an appropriately corrected level; holding lyrica
   is in setting of no POs
   .
   # Afib with [**Name (NI) 1978**] - unclear precipitating factor, likley in setting of
   fever and new infection.  BPs stable, HRs to 140s.  Not changed with
   metoprolol; IV dilt pushes work.
   - start dilt gtt, transition to PO if GI access achieved
   - echo done earlier in admission, no need to repeat at this time
   - no PE based on CTA
   - EKG without signs of ischemia
   .
   # Respiratory/PNA: Has known PNA on CXR, treated from the start.  Abx
   treatment included vanco and cefepime started [**3-29**].  Did get one dose
   of ceftriaxone.  Was started on levo for atypical coverage on [**3-29**]
   which was stopped [**4-2**].  Flagyl was started [**4-2**] (today).  Culture data
   only positive for GPCs in sputum, no speciation done.  Is tachypneic
   but oxygentating well.
   - cont vancomycin, cefepime for 7 days (until [**4-5**])
   - oxygen to maintain sats >92%
   - CXR and CTA without changes, still with RLL PNA
   .
   # Falls/?Syncope: recent admit with extensive work-up attributing LE
   weakness and falls to cervical spondylosis and multilevel degenerative
   disease with myelopathy and neuropathy. Unclear if LOC with fall.
   - tele
   - MRA of neck done on last admit showing no flow limiting lesions
   - dilantin as above for seizure ppx
   - monitor resp status
   .
   # Myeloma: On pulse decadron as per heme-onc for tx of myeloma.
   - Next pulse due in 1 week.
   - will touch base with heme onc about next steroid dose
   .
   # Pancytopenia: [**3-7**] to myeloma.
   - Transfuse platelets with goal > 80K
   - Transfuse hct < 21
   .
   # Renal Failure: At baseline from last admission. Unclear etiology to
   CKD, but may represent complication from myeloma.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls, and severe peripheral neuropathy. She was admitted to the ICU with acute on chronic subdural hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 38.3°C, heart rate 106 bpm, blood pressure 120/61 mmHg, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 96%.
* Neurological status: The patient is non-responsive except to painful stimuli, with no purposeful movements, and no assessment of tone.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has atrial fibrillation, with a normal pulse and blood pressure.
* Respiratory status: The patient has pneumonia, with a chest X-ray showing right lower lobe pneumonia.
* Renal status: The patient has chronic kidney disease, with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL.
* Hematological status: The patient has pancytopenia, with a platelet count of 96,000/mm³, and a hemoglobin level of 6.6 g/dL.
* Infectious status: The patient has a fever, with cultures pending for blood, urine, and stool.
* Other medical conditions: The patient has a history of myeloma, and is taking pulse steroids for treatment.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Meningitis: The patient's fever and lack of response to painful stimuli suggest the possibility of meningitis, although the lumbar puncture was initially negative.
* Sepsis: The patient's fever and pancytopenia suggest the possibility of sepsis, although the patient is not showing signs of septic shock.
* Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen and lead to respiratory failure.
* Subdural hematoma: The patient's subdural hematoma may worsen and lead to increased intracranial pressure and neurological deterioration.
* Myeloma: The patient's myeloma may progress and lead to further complications.
* Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen and lead to further complications.
* Bleeding: The patient's pancytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitoring of vital signs and neurological status
* Administration of antibiotics for pneumonia
* Administration of anticoagulation therapy for subdural hematoma
* Transfusion of platelets and red blood cells as needed
* Monitoring of renal function and adjusting treatment as needed
* Monitoring of infectious status and adjusting treatment as needed
* Consultation with neurology and hematology services as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o F w/ multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls in setting of
   severe peripheral neuropathy who now p/w acute on chronic subdural
   hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.  Transferred back to
   MICU after becoming non responsive, febrile and in afib with [**Year (4 digits) 1978**].
   .
   # AMS - unclear etiology, CT of head negative for change in SDH and
   patient moving all 4 extremities.  Would continue to monitor CTs for
   changes as needed.  Could be secondary to infection as patient is
   febrile.  Has known pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be c.diff in the setting of broad
   spectrum abx.  Could be drug effect, although not on any sedating meds
   now except oxybutinin.  Is hemodynamically stable and should have
   adequate perfusion to brain.  Recent MRI showed nonobstruction flow.
   - f/u pan cultures of blood, urine, stool
   - hold oxybutinin
   - follow up neuro recs
   .
   # Fever - fever today, culturing, is immunecompromised secondary to
   pulse steroids for MM.  Being treated for HAP and aspiration pneumonia
   with broad spectrum vanco, cefepime, flagyl.  Not covering ESBLs.  Also
   not covering fungal infections.
   - f/u cultures
   - continue current abx
   - consider DVT as source of fever, f/u LENIs
   - hemodynamically stable, does not appear septic
   .
   # RUQ pain - unclear etiology, patient is post cholecystectomy so not
   gallbladder pain.  Could be rib fracture v. pleural pain v. colitis.
   - f/u abdominal ultrasound
   - consider abx
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma: Neurosurgery following, no acute change from OSH
   imaging, no changes in CT today.
   - q4H neuro checks overnight
   - transfuse plt's with goal of >80, plt 96 now
   - INR 1.3, s/p Vit K treatment
   - continue dilantin; was also on pregabalin but floor team was consider
   stopping it - will follow up with neuro recs
   .
   # Afib with [**Name (NI) 1978**] - unclear precipitating factor, likley in setting of
   fever and new infection.  BPs stable, HRs to 140s.  Not changed with
   metoprolol; IV dilt pushes work.
   - start dilt gtt
   - echo in AM, TSH (of note had echo initially in hospitalization as
   part of syncope workup which was unrevealing except for pulm HTN)
   - consider CTA to r/o PE as cause of new afib
   - EKG without signs of ischemia
   - trend CEs to rule out ischemia, although unlikely cause
   .
   # Respiratory/PNA: Has known PNA on CXR, treated from the start.  Abx
   treatment included vanco and cefepime started [**3-29**].  Did get one dose
   of ceftriaxone.  Was started on levo for atypical coverage on [**3-29**]
   which was stopped [**4-2**].  Flagyl was started [**4-2**] (today).  Culture data
   only positive for GPCs in sputum, no speciation done.  Is tachypneic
   but oxygentating well.
   - cont vancomycin, cefepime for 7 days (until [**4-5**])
   - oxygen to maintain sats >92%
   - CXR to look for new, changing infiltrates; pleural effusions or other
   lung changes.
   .
   # Falls/?Syncope: recent admit with extensive work-up attributing LE
   weakness and falls to cervical spondylosis and multilevel degenerative
   disease with myelopathy and neuropathy. Unclear if LOC with fall.
   - tele
   - MRA of neck done on last admit showing no flow limiting lesions
   - dilantin as above for seizure ppx
   - monitor resp status
   .
   # Myeloma: On pulse decadron as per heme-onc for tx of myeloma.
   - Next pulse due in 1 week.
   - d/w outpatient heme-onc
   .
   # Pancytopenia: [**3-7**] to myeloma.
   - Transfuse platelets with goal > 80K
   - Transfuse hct < 21
   .
   # Renal Failure: At baseline from last admission. Unclear etiology to
   CKD, but may represent complication from myeloma.
   - Trend Cr
   - Cr 1.2 up from 1.1 yesterday (high was 1.3 this admission)
   .
   # FEN: NPO for AMS, replete lytes PRN
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots (no SQ hep d/t SDH), PPI, pneumovax given at
   OSH
   .
   # Access: PICC line
   .
   # Code: Ok to intubate, patient declines resuscitation but son who is
   HCP says yes to intubation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including multiple myeloma, severe peripheral neuropathy, and a recent fall resulting in an acute on chronic subdural hematoma and pneumonia.

The patient's current condition is marked by:

1. Altered mental status (AMS) of unclear etiology, with a normal CT scan and no acute change in subdural hematoma.
2. Fever, which may be related to infection, particularly given the patient's immunocompromised state due to pulse steroids for myeloma.
3. Right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, which is unclear in etiology, but may be related to rib fracture, pleural pain, or colitis.
4. Atrial fibrillation (AF) of unclear precipitating factor, which may be related to fever and new infection.
5. Pneumonia, which is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl.
6. Pancytopenia, which is likely related to myeloma.
7. Renal failure, which is at baseline from the patient's previous admission and may be a complication of myeloma.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Meningitis, given the patient's altered mental status and the need for a lumbar puncture.
2. Sepsis, given the patient's fever and pancytopenia.
3. Respiratory failure, given the patient's pneumonia and tachypnea.
4. Bleeding complications, given the patient's pancytopenia and recent fall.
5. Thromboembolic events, given the patient's immobility and pancytopenia.
6. Fungal infections, given the patient's immunocompromised state and the lack of antifungal coverage in their antibiotic regimen.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics for pneumonia and possible secondary bacterial infections.
2. Platelet transfusions to maintain a platelet count > 80,000.
3. Hemodynamic monitoring to ensure adequate perfusion to the brain.
4. Neurological checks to monitor for signs of worsening subdural hematoma.
5. Respiratory support, including oxygen therapy and possible intubation.
6. Renal function monitoring to assess for worsening kidney function.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and their disposition is pending improvement in their respiratory status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status (AMS) and is currently being treated for anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding), abdominal pain, fever, and atrial fibrillation (AFib). The patient has a history of low-grade fevers, blood and urine cultures sent, and a CTA showing a right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA) and possible pyelonephritis. The patient has a PICC line inserted and is receiving antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have a low hemoglobin level of 19% and are receiving blood products.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's anemia is secondary to blood loss, and there is a risk of further bleeding complications, especially with the presence of a PICC line.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of low-grade fevers, and the cultures sent may reveal a bacterial or fungal infection, which could worsen the patient's condition.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has a right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA), which could lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has atrial fibrillation (AFib), which could lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, stroke, or arrhythmias.
5. Neurological complications: The patient has altered mental status (AMS), which could worsen if not properly managed, leading to further neurological complications.
6. Renal failure: The patient has possible pyelonephritis, which could lead to renal failure if not properly managed.
7. Sepsis: The patient's infection could lead to sepsis, which could worsen the patient's condition and lead to multiple organ failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with a subdural hematoma (SDH) following a fall. She also has pneumonia (PNA) and a chest X-ray (CXR) showing an infiltrate. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with poor mentation, right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, fever, and atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.3°C (100.9°F)
* Heart rate: 103 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 129/63 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Thin
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, absent right radial pulse, and present left radial and digital pulses
* Respiratory: Clear breath sounds
* Abdominal: Soft, tender RUQ
* Neurologic: Not attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has purposeful movement

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 6.6 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 8.4 K/uL
* Platelet count: 76 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.04 ng/mL
* Glucose: 143 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies reveal:

* Chest X-ray: Infiltrate
* Abdominal CT: No renal stones or obstruction

The patient's diagnosis is unclear, with potential causes including:

* Delirium versus subclinical seizures
* Meningitis (ruled out by LP)
* Pyelonephritis (unlikely due to negative U/A)
* Pulmonary hypertension and diastolic dysfunction (underlying cause of AFib)

The patient's plan includes:

* EEG to evaluate for seizures
* Follow-up LP results
* Dobhoff placement for total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
* Tolerating diltiazem drip, unable to take oral medications currently
* Consideration of stress ulcer prophylaxis

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis due to unknown source of infection
* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to atrial fibrillation
* Renal failure due to dehydration or underlying kidney disease
* Neurological decline due to subdural hematoma or sepsis
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer or underlying gastrointestinal disease

It is crucial to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust the plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o F w/ multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls in setting of
   severe peripheral neuropathy who now p/w acute on chronic subdural
   hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.  Transferred back to
   MICU after becoming non responsive, febrile and in afib with [**Year (4 digits) 1978**].
   .
   # AMS - unclear etiology, CT of head negative for change in SDH and
   patient moving all 4 extremities.  Would continue to monitor CTs for
   changes as needed.  Neuro consult, checking dilantin levels and EEG.
   Could be secondary to infection as patient is febrile.  Has known
   pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be c.diff in the setting of broad spectrum abx.  Maybe
   meningitis, although LP initially negative.  Could be drug effect,
   although not on any sedating meds now except oxybutinin.  Is
   hemodynamically stable and should have adequate perfusion to brain.
   Recent MRI showed nonobstruction flow.
   - f/u pan cultures of blood, urine, stool
   - f/u LP cultures
   - EEG today to rule out subclinical seizures
   - MRI to rule out stroke
   - LENIs and CTA neg for clots
   - hold oxybutinin
   - follow up neuro recs
   - could be delirium in setting of pain
   .
   # Fever - fever today, culturing, is immunecompromised secondary to
   pulse steroids for MM.  Being treated for HAP and aspiration pneumonia
   with broad spectrum vanco, cefepime, flagyl.  Not covering ESBLs.  Also
   not covering fungal infections.
   - f/u cultures
   - continue current abx
 see if infection declares itself
   - consider DVT as source of fever, f/u LENIs
   - hemodynamically stable, does not appear septic
   .
   # RUQ pain - unclear etiology, patient is post cholecystectomy so not
   gallbladder pain.  Could be rib fracture v. pleural pain v. colitis vs.
   pneumonia pain.
   - f/u abdominal ultrasound
 negative
   - CT abd and pelvis did not show pathology which could account for
   pain; consider possible obstructing stone as cause as it would not be
   well visualized on CT
   - no abx for now
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma: Neurosurgery following, no acute change from OSH
   imaging, no changes in CT today.
   - transfuse plt's with goal of >80, plt 96 now
   - INR 1.5, s/p Vit K treatment
   - continue dilantin at an appropriately corrected level; holding lyrica
   is in setting of no POs
   .
   # Afib with [**Name (NI) 1978**] - unclear precipitating factor, likley in setting of
   fever and new infection.  BPs stable, HRs to 140s.  Not changed with
   metoprolol; IV dilt pushes work.
   - start dilt gtt, transition to PO if GI access achieved
   - echo done earlier in admission, no need to repeat at this time
   - no PE based on CTA
   - EKG without signs of ischemia
   .
   # Respiratory/PNA: Has known PNA on CXR, treated from the start.  Abx
   treatment included vanco and cefepime started [**3-29**].  Did get one dose
   of ceftriaxone.  Was started on levo for atypical coverage on [**3-29**]
   which was stopped [**4-2**].  Flagyl was started [**4-2**] (today).  Culture data
   only positive for GPCs in sputum, no speciation done.  Is tachypneic
   but oxygentating well.
   - cont vancomycin, cefepime for 7 days (until [**4-5**])
   - oxygen to maintain sats >92%
   - CXR and CTA without changes, still with RLL PNA
   .
   # Falls/?Syncope: recent admit with extensive work-up attributing LE
   weakness and falls to cervical spondylosis and multilevel degenerative
   disease with myelopathy and neuropathy. Unclear if LOC with fall.
   - tele
   - MRA of neck done on last admit showing no flow limiting lesions
   - dilantin as above for seizure ppx
   - monitor resp status
   .
   # Myeloma: On pulse decadron as per heme-onc for tx of myeloma.
   - Next pulse due in 1 week.
   - will touch base with heme onc about next steroid dose
   .
   # Pancytopenia: [**3-7**] to myeloma.
   - Transfuse platelets with goal > 80K
   - Transfuse hct < 21
   .
   # Renal Failure: At baseline from last admission. Unclear etiology to
   CKD, but may represent complication from myeloma.
   - Trend Cr
   - Cr 1.2 up from 1.1 yesterday (high was 1.3 this admission)
   .
   # FEN: NPO for AMS, replete lytes PRN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls, severe peripheral neuropathy, and a recent unwitnessed fall leading to an acute on chronic subdural hematoma and pneumonia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Neurological: The patient is non-responsive, febrile, and in atrial fibrillation. The EEG shows diffuse encephalopathy, and the MRI shows a stable hematoma with chronic microvascular infarct.
* Respiratory: The patient has known pneumonia, treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and is oxygenating well.
* Cardiovascular: The patient is hemodynamically stable, with a normal blood pressure and heart rate.
* Renal: The patient has chronic kidney disease, with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL.
* Hematological: The patient has pancytopenia, with a platelet count of 76 K/uL and a hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a feeding tube in place, and has been tried to be placed with a Dobhoff tube, but was unable to cooperate with the procedure.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Seizures: The patient's EEG shows diffuse encephalopathy, which may be indicative of seizure activity.
* Infection: The patient is febrile, and has a known pneumonia. There is a possibility of secondary infections, such as c. difficile, or meningitis.
* Delirium: The patient's neurological status is altered, which may be contributing to her delirium.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias.
* Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen, leading to renal failure.
* Bleeding: The patient's pancytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia
* Diltiazem for atrial fibrillation
* Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis
* Platelet transfusions to increase platelet count
* Hemoglobin transfusions to increase hemoglobin level
* Oxybutinin to be held due to the patient's non-responsiveness
* Neurological consultation to rule out subclinical seizures
* MRI to rule out stroke
* CTA to rule out clots
* Follow-up of pan cultures of blood, urine, and stool
* Follow-up of LP cultures
* EEG to rule out subclinical seizures
* MRA of neck to evaluate cervical spondylosis and multilevel degenerative disease

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and her disposition is pending improvement in her respiratory status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-inch tall individual with a history of anemia, abdominal pain, fever, altered mental status, and atrial fibrillation. The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving various medications, including diltiazem, furosemide, lorazepam, and metoprolol.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 38.3°C (100.9°F) with a current temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F)
* Heart rate: 94 beats per minute with a range of 91-121 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 116/66 mmHg with a range of 75-158/60-100 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 34 breaths per minute with a range of 22-43 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient has a diffuse encephalopathy on preliminary EEG and a chronic microvascular infarct on preliminary MRI. The patient's family is aware of the plan to place a feeding tube and has given consent.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.4-10.7 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 7.7-9.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 76-117 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.1-1.3 mg/dL
* Trop T: 0.04 ng/mL
* Glucose: 102-246 mg/dL
* Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their altered mental status and inability to cooperate with procedures. The patient's skin, peripheral vascular, and neurologic examinations are not assessable.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Increased risk of bleeding due to the patient's anemia and recent blood loss
* Increased risk of infection due to the patient's altered mental status and inability to cooperate with procedures
* Increased risk of cardiac complications due to the patient's atrial fibrillation
* Increased risk of respiratory complications due to the patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation
* Increased risk of gastrointestinal complications due to the patient's abdominal pain and altered mental status
* Increased risk of kidney injury due to the patient's creatinine levels

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to minimize the risk of these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o F w/ multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls in setting of
   severe peripheral neuropathy who now p/w acute on chronic subdural
   hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.  Transferred back to
   MICU after becoming non responsive, febrile and in afib with [**Year (4 digits) 1978**].
   .
   # AMS - unclear etiology, CT of head negative for change in SDH and
   patient moving all 4 extremities.  Would continue to monitor CTs for
   changes as needed.  Neuro consult, checking dilantin levels and EEG.
   Could be secondary to infection as patient is febrile.  Has known
   pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be c.diff in the setting of broad spectrum abx.  Less
   likely meningitis, LP initially negative.  Could be drug effect,
   although not on any sedating meds now except oxybutinin.  Is
   hemodynamically stable and should have adequate perfusion to brain.
   Recent MRI showed nonobstruction flow.
   - f/u pan cultures of blood, urine, stool
   - f/u LP cultures
   - EEG
 prelim read is normal
   - MRI to r/o CVA
   - LENIs and CTA neg for clots
   - hold oxybutinin
   - follow up neuro recs
   - could be delirium in setting of pain
   .
   # Fever - fever again today, culturing, is immunocompromised secondary
   to pulse steroids for MM.  Being treated for HAP and aspiration
   pneumonia with broad spectrum vanco, cefepime,.  Not covering ESBLs.
   Also not covering fungal infections.
   - f/u cultures
   - continue current abx
 see if infection declares itself
   - remains hemodynamically stable
   .
   # RUQ pain
 stable, unclear etiology, patient is post cholecystectomy
   so not gallbladder pain.  Could be rib fracture v. pleural pain v.
   colitis vs. pneumonia pain.
   - f/u abdominal ultrasound
 negative
   - CT abd and pelvis did not show pathology which could account for
   pain; consider possible obstructing stone as cause as it would not be
   well visualized on CT
   - no abx for now
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma: Neurosurgery following, no acute change from OSH
   imaging, no changes in CT today.
   - transfuse plt's with goal of >80, plt 96 now
   - INR 1.5, s/p Vit K treatment
   - continue dilantin at an appropriately corrected level; holding lyrica
   is in setting of no POs
   .
   # Afib with [**Name (NI) 1978**] - unclear precipitating factor, likely in setting of
   fever and new infection.  BPs stable, HRs to 140s.  Not changed with
   metoprolol; IV dilt pushes work.
   - transitioned to PO dilt today, as NGT in place
   - echo done earlier in admission, no need to repeat at this time
   - no PE based on CTA
   - EKG without signs of ischemia
   .
   # Respiratory/PNA: Has known PNA on CXR, treated from the start.  Abx
   treatment included vanco and cefepime started [**3-29**].  Did get one dose
   of ceftriaxone.  Was started on levo for atypical coverage on [**3-29**]
   which was stopped [**4-2**].  Flagyl was started [**4-2**]. Culture data only
   positive for GPCs in sputum, no speciation done.  Is tachypneic but
   oxygentating well.
   - cont vancomycin, cefepime for 7 days (until [**4-5**]) , flagyl d/c
   - oxygen to maintain sats >92%
   - CXR stable
   .
   # Falls/?Syncope: recent admit with extensive work-up attributing LE
   weakness and falls to cervical spondylosis and multilevel degenerative
   disease with myelopathy and neuropathy. Unclear if LOC with fall.
   - tele
   - MRA of neck done on last admit showing no flow limiting lesions
   - dilantin as above for seizure ppx
   - monitor resp status
   .
   # Myeloma: On pulse decadron as per heme-onc for tx of myeloma.
   - Next pulse due in 1 week.
   - will touch base with heme onc about next steroid dose
   .
   # Pancytopenia: [**3-7**] to myeloma.
   - Transfuse platelets with goal > 80K
   - Transfuse hct < 21, rcv
d one unit [**2157-4-4**] in AM
   .
   # Renal Failure: At baseline from last admission. Unclear etiology to
   CKD, but may represent complication from myeloma.
   - Trend Cr
   - Cr stable at 1.1
   .
   # FEN: NPO for AMS, replete lytes PRN
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots (no SQ hep d/t SDH), PPI, pneumovax given at
   OSH

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls, and severe peripheral neuropathy. She was admitted to the ICU with acute on chronic subdural hematoma, pneumonia, and altered mental status. The patient is febrile, has atrial fibrillation, and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected infection. She has known pneumonia and is at risk for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient's neurological status is concerning, with non-purposeful movements and no orientation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's febrile state and altered mental status suggest the possibility of infection, which could be secondary to pneumonia, C. diff, or another source.
2. Seizure: The patient's recent EEG showed diffuse encephalopathy, and she is receiving Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's tachypnea and need for oxygen therapy suggest the possibility of respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by her pneumonia and atrial fibrillation.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and recent falls suggest the possibility of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's baseline renal failure and electrolyte imbalances may worsen with ongoing infection and antibiotic treatment.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's recent abdominal pain and diarrhea suggest the possibility of gastrointestinal complications, including Clostridium difficile infection or inflammatory bowel disease.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and non-purposeful movements suggest the possibility of neurological complications, including cerebral edema, hydrocephalus, or neurotoxicity from antibiotics or other medications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected infection.
2. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and consider EEG and MRI to rule out seizure or other neurological complications.
3. Adjust antibiotic therapy based on culture results and patient response.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and consider cardiac medications or interventions if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's renal status closely and consider dialysis if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely and consider gastrointestinal medications or interventions if necessary.
8. Consider consulting with a neurologist or other specialists to further evaluate the patient's neurological status and potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old individual with a history of diffuse encephalopathy, chronic microvascular infarct, and a stable hematoma on preliminary MRI. They are currently receiving Diltiazem IV infusion and have been transitioned to PO medication. The patient has a history of antibiotic use, including Vancomycin and Cefipime, and has been ordered for IR placement of a feeding tube due to inability to cooperate with the procedure. The patient has a fever, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, and is experiencing abdominal pain.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, altered mental status, and diffuse encephalopathy may indicate the presence of sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death if left untreated.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient's anemia and history of blood loss may increase the risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, or bleeding into the abdominal cavity.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's atrial fibrillation and altered mental status may increase the risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia and acidosis.
4. Infection: The patient's abdominal pain, fever, and altered mental status may indicate the presence of an infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting may indicate the presence of gastrointestinal complications, including gastritis, pancreatitis, or small intestine obstruction.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status, diffuse encephalopathy, and chronic microvascular infarct may increase the risk of neurological complications, including seizures, stroke, or cerebral edema.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may increase the risk of cardiac complications, including heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o F w/ multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls in setting of
   severe peripheral neuropathy who now p/w acute on chronic subdural
   hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.  Transferred back to
   MICU after becoming non responsive, febrile and in afib with [**Year (4 digits) 1978**].
   .
   # AMS - unclear etiology, CT of head negative for change in SDH and
   patient moving all 4 extremities.  Would continue to monitor CTs for
   changes as needed.  Neuro consult, checking dilantin levels and EEG.
   Could be secondary to infection as patient is febrile.  Has known
   pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be c.diff in the setting of broad spectrum abx.  Maybe
   meningitis, although LP initially negative.  Could be drug effect,
   although not on any sedating meds now except oxybutinin.  Is
   hemodynamically stable and should have adequate perfusion to brain.
   Recent MRI showed nonobstruction flow.
   - f/u pan cultures of blood, urine, stool
   - f/u LP cultures
   - EEG today to rule out subclinical seizures
   - MRI to rule out stroke
   - LENIs and CTA neg for clots
   - hold oxybutinin
   - follow up neuro recs
   - could be delirium in setting of pain
   .
   # Fever - fever today, culturing, is immunecompromised secondary to
   pulse steroids for MM.  Being treated for HAP and aspiration pneumonia
   with broad spectrum vanco, cefepime, flagyl.  Not covering ESBLs.  Also
   not covering fungal infections.
   - f/u cultures
   - continue current abx
 see if infection declares itself
   - consider DVT as source of fever, f/u LENIs
   - hemodynamically stable, does not appear septic
   .
   # RUQ pain - unclear etiology, patient is post cholecystectomy so not
   gallbladder pain.  Could be rib fracture v. pleural pain v. colitis vs.
   pneumonia pain.
   - f/u abdominal ultrasound
 negative
   - CT abd and pelvis did not show pathology which could account for
   pain; consider possible obstructing stone as cause as it would not be
   well visualized on CT
   - no abx for now
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma: Neurosurgery following, no acute change from OSH
   imaging, no changes in CT today.
   - transfuse plt's with goal of >80, plt 96 now
   - INR 1.5, s/p Vit K treatment
   - continue dilantin at an appropriately corrected level; holding lyrica
   is in setting of no POs
   .
   # Afib with [**Name (NI) 1978**] - unclear precipitating factor, likley in setting of
   fever and new infection.  BPs stable, HRs to 140s.  Not changed with
   metoprolol; IV dilt pushes work.
   - start dilt gtt, transition to PO if GI access achieved
   - echo done earlier in admission, no need to repeat at this time
   - no PE based on CTA
   - EKG without signs of ischemia
   .
   # Respiratory/PNA: Has known PNA on CXR, treated from the start.  Abx
   treatment included vanco and cefepime started [**3-29**].  Did get one dose
   of ceftriaxone.  Was started on levo for atypical coverage on [**3-29**]
   which was stopped [**4-2**].  Flagyl was started [**4-2**] (today).  Culture data
   only positive for GPCs in sputum, no speciation done.  Is tachypneic
   but oxygentating well.
   - cont vancomycin, cefepime for 7 days (until [**4-5**])
   - oxygen to maintain sats >92%
   - CXR and CTA without changes, still with RLL PNA
   .
   # Falls/?Syncope: recent admit with extensive work-up attributing LE
   weakness and falls to cervical spondylosis and multilevel degenerative
   disease with myelopathy and neuropathy. Unclear if LOC with fall.
   - tele
   - MRA of neck done on last admit showing no flow limiting lesions
   - dilantin as above for seizure ppx
   - monitor resp status
   .
   # Myeloma: On pulse decadron as per heme-onc for tx of myeloma.
   - Next pulse due in 1 week.
   - will touch base with heme onc about next steroid dose
   .
   # Pancytopenia: [**3-7**] to myeloma.
   - Transfuse platelets with goal > 80K
   - Transfuse hct < 21
   .
   # Renal Failure: At baseline from last admission. Unclear etiology to
   CKD, but may represent complication from myeloma.
   - Trend Cr
   - Cr 1.2 up from 1.1 yesterday (high was 1.3 this admission)
   .
   # FEN: NPO for AMS, replete lytes PRN
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots (no SQ hep d/t SDH), PPI, pneumovax given at
   OSH
   .
   # Access: PICC line
   .
   # Code: Ok to intubate, patient declines resuscitation but son who is
   HCP says yes to intubation.
   .
   # Communication: Patient, son is HCP, family meeting today
   .
   # Disposition: pending resp status improvement, PT c/s

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   82 y/o F w/ multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls in setting of
   severe peripheral neuropathy who now p/w acute on chronic subdural
   hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.  Transferred back to
   MICU after becoming non responsive, febrile and in afib with [**Year (4 digits) 1978**].
   .
   # AMS - unclear etiology, CT of head negative for change in SDH and
   patient moving all 4 extremities.  Would continue to monitor CTs for
   changes as needed.  Neuro consult, checking dilantin levels and EEG.
   Could be secondary to infection as patient is febrile.  Has known
   pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be c.diff in the setting of broad spectrum abx.  Maybe
   meningitis, although LP initially negative.  Could be drug effect,
   although not on any sedating meds now except oxybutinin.  Is
   hemodynamically stable and should have adequate perfusion to brain.
   Recent MRI showed nonobstruction flow.
   - f/u pan cultures of blood, urine, stool

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls, and severe peripheral neuropathy. She was admitted to the ICU with acute on chronic subdural hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall. She is currently non-responsive, febrile, and in atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 94 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 116/66 mmHg. She is receiving diltiazem, furosemide, lorazepam, and dilantin infusions. She is also receiving antibiotics for pneumonia, including vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's neurologic examination shows diffuse encephalopathy, with no acute changes on MRI. She is responding to noxious stimuli and has non-purposeful movement.

Potential medical complications:

1. Infection: The patient's fever and pneumonia make it likely that she has an infection. The possibility of central nervous system (CNS) infection, such as meningitis, should be considered.
2. Subdural hematoma: The patient's subdural hematoma is not acute, but it is still a concern. The patient's neurologic examination shows diffuse encephalopathy, which could be related to the hematoma.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is likely related to her infection and may be a complication of her underlying condition.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is likely related to her multiple myeloma and may be a complication of her treatment.
5. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure is likely related to her underlying condition and may be a complication of her treatment.
6. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could be related to her infection, pain, or other underlying conditions.
7. DVT: The patient's immobility and history of falls make it likely that she has a DVT. This should be evaluated further.

The patient's treatment plan includes antibiotics for pneumonia, treatment of her subdural hematoma, and management of her atrial fibrillation. She will also receive transfusions for her anemia and thrombocytopenia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of her pancytopenia and renal failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a diagnosis of acute embolic stroke affecting the right temporal and frontal lobes. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, and blood pressure of 140/81 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, and elevated white blood cell count with a count of 10.7 K/uL. The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, with an ALT of 60 IU/L and AST of 94 IU/L.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to altered mental status, and therefore, the peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic examinations were not assessed.

The patient's plan includes continued diltiazem infusion, and the plan is to wean off the drip. The patient is receiving nutrition through a nasogastric tube, and glycemic control is being maintained.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Increased risk of bleeding due to the patient's acute embolic stroke and the ongoing use of anticoagulant medications.
2. Development of pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and the use of mechanical ventilation.
3. Increased risk of sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's fever and altered mental status.
4. Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's immobility and the use of central lines.
5. Worsening of the patient's anemia, which may require blood transfusions.
6. Increased risk of electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia, due to the patient's altered mental status and the use of diuretics.
7. Development of cardiac arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation, which may require cardioversion or antiarrhythmic medications.
8. Increased risk of aspiration pneumonia due to the patient's altered mental status and the use of nasogastric tubes.

It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-inch tall individual with a weight not specified, admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute stroke likely due to embolic occlusion of the right temporal and frontal lobes. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 102 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 140/81 mmHg.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently receiving diltiazem at 5 mg/hour. They have been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefipime, and are being treated with pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, but they are non-verbal and respond to noxious stimuli. They have a left eye ecchymosis and are tender to palpation in the right upper quadrant. Their extremities are absent on the right side, and they have a normal skin temperature.

Laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver enzymes. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range, and they have a mild elevation in lactate levels.

The patient's medical complications include anemia, abdominal pain, fever, altered mental status, and atrial fibrillation. The patient has a code status of DNR and is receiving nutrition via a nasogastric tube.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute may increase their risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's abdominal pain and tenderness may increase their risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may increase their risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
5. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and fever may increase their risk of infection, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or bloodstream infections.
6. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's anemia and blood loss may lead to hemodynamic instability, which can increase their risk of cardiovascular complications.
7. Neurological deterioration: The patient's altered mental status and absent extremities may worsen, leading to neurological deterioration.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o F w/ multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls in setting of
   severe peripheral neuropathy who now p/w acute on chronic subdural
   hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.  Transferred back to
   MICU after becoming non responsive, febrile and in afib with [**Year (4 digits) 1978**].
   .
   # AMS - unclear etiology, CT of head negative for change in SDH and
   patient moving all 4 extremities.  Would continue to monitor CTs for
   changes as needed.  Neuro consult, checking dilantin levels and EEG.
   Could be secondary to infection as patient is febrile.  Has known
   pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be c.diff in the setting of broad spectrum abx.  Less
   likely meningitis, LP initially negative.  Could be drug effect,
   although not on any sedating meds now except oxybutinin.  Is
   hemodynamically stable and should have adequate perfusion to brain.
   Recent MRI showed nonobstruction flow.
   - f/u pan cultures of blood, urine, stool
   - f/u LP cultures
   - EEG
 prelim read is normal
   - MRI to r/o CVA
   - LENIs and CTA neg for clots
   - hold oxybutinin
   - follow up neuro recs
   - could be delirium in setting of pain
   .
   # Fever - fever again today, culturing, is immunocompromised secondary
   to pulse steroids for MM.  Being treated for HAP and aspiration
   pneumonia with broad spectrum vanco, cefepime,.  Not covering ESBLs.
   Also not covering fungal infections.
   - f/u cultures
   - continue current abx
 see if infection declares itself
   - remains hemodynamically stable
   .
   # RUQ pain
 stable, unclear etiology, patient is post cholecystectomy
   so not gallbladder pain.  Could be rib fracture v. pleural pain v.
   colitis vs. pneumonia pain.
   - f/u abdominal ultrasound
 negative
   - CT abd and pelvis did not show pathology which could account for
   pain; consider possible obstructing stone as cause as it would not be
   well visualized on CT
   - no abx for now
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma: Neurosurgery following, no acute change from OSH
   imaging, no changes in CT today.
   - transfuse plt's with goal of >80, plt 96 now
   - INR 1.5, s/p Vit K treatment
   - continue dilantin at an appropriately corrected level; holding lyrica
   is in setting of no POs
   .
   # Afib with [**Name (NI) 1978**] - unclear precipitating factor, likely in setting of
   fever and new infection.  BPs stable, HRs to 140s.  Not changed with
   metoprolol; IV dilt pushes work.
   - transitioned to PO dilt today, as NGT in place
   - echo done earlier in admission, no need to repeat at this time
   - no PE based on CTA
   - EKG without signs of ischemia
   .
   # Respiratory/PNA: Has known PNA on CXR, treated from the start.  Abx
   treatment included vanco and cefepime started [**3-29**].  Did get one dose
   of ceftriaxone.  Was started on levo for atypical coverage on [**3-29**]
   which was stopped [**4-2**].  Flagyl was started [**4-2**]. Culture data only
   positive for GPCs in sputum, no speciation done.  Is tachypneic but
   oxygentating well.
   - cont vancomycin, cefepime for 7 days (until [**4-5**]) , flagyl d/c
   - oxygen to maintain sats >92%
   - CXR stable
   .
   # Falls/?Syncope: recent admit with extensive work-up attributing LE
   weakness and falls to cervical spondylosis and multilevel degenerative
   disease with myelopathy and neuropathy. Unclear if LOC with fall.
   - tele
   - MRA of neck done on last admit showing no flow limiting lesions
   - dilantin as above for seizure ppx
   - monitor resp status
   .
   # Myeloma: On pulse decadron as per heme-onc for tx of myeloma.
   - Next pulse due in 1 week.
   - will touch base with heme onc about next steroid dose
   .
   # Pancytopenia: [**3-7**] to myeloma.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls, and severe peripheral neuropathy. She has been admitted to the ICU with an acute on chronic subdural hematoma, pneumonia, and altered mental status. She has been febrile and in atrial fibrillation, with a recent MRI showing small superficial cortical areas of likely embolic stroke in the right temporal and frontal lobes.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, and blood pressure of 140/81 mmHg. She is oxygenating well on a nasal cannula, with a SpO2 of 95%. Her respiratory support includes oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 8.4 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 22.2%
* Plt: 76 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 1.3 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.04 ng/mL
* Glucose: 143 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Diltiazem: 5 mg/hour
* Pantoprazole (Protonix): [**2157-4-4**] 08:22 AM
* Dilantin: [**2157-4-5**] 12:00 AM
* Vancomycin: [**2157-4-4**] 08:22 AM
* Cefepime: [**2157-4-4**] 10:00 PM

The patient's medical history includes:

* Multiple myeloma
* Cervical spondylosis and multilevel degenerative disease with myelopathy and neuropathy
* Cholecystectomy

The patient's current medical conditions include:

* Acute on chronic subdural hematoma
* Pneumonia
* Altered mental status
* Atrial fibrillation
* Renal failure (at baseline)
* Pancytopenia (attributed to myeloma)

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis due to pneumonia or other infections
* Worsening of renal failure
* Bleeding complications due to subdural hematoma
* Development of a seizure disorder
* Progression of atrial fibrillation
* Respiratory failure
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer disease
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
* Pneumonia
* Worsening of peripheral neuropathy

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing antibiotics for pneumonia and aspiration
* Monitoring of subdural hematoma and potential surgical intervention
* Management of atrial fibrillation
* Monitoring of renal function and potential dialysis
* Monitoring of blood counts and potential transfusions
* Pain management
* Respiratory support
* Nutritional support
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o F w/ multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls in setting of
   severe peripheral neuropathy who now p/w acute on chronic subdural
   hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.  Transferred back to
   MICU after becoming non responsive, febrile and in afib with [**Year (4 digits) 1978**].
   .
   # AMS - unclear etiology, CT of head negative for change in SDH and
   patient moving all 4 extremities. 24 hour EEG showing spikes that might
   represent subacute status epilepticus. Could be secondary to infection
   as patient is febrile and has known pneumonia.  MRI shows acute and
   subacute infarcts c/w infarcts, no hemorrhagic conversion, which has
   potential to contribute to the AMS. Recent MRI showed nonobstruction
   flow. [**Month (only) 8**] be c.diff in the setting of broad spectrum abx.  Less likely
   meningitis, LP initially negative.  Could be drug effect, although not
   on any sedating meds now except oxybutinin. Could be delirium in
   setting of pain.  Is hemodynamically stable and should have adequate
   perfusion to brain.  LENIs and CTA neg for clots
   - f/u pan cultures of blood, urine, stool
 so far negative
   - f/u LP cultures

   # RUQ pain
 stable, unclear etiology, patient is post cholecystectomy
   so not gallbladder pain.  Could be rib fracture v. pleural pain v.
   colitis vs. pneumonia pain.
   - f/u abdominal ultrasound
 negative
   - CT abd and pelvis did not show pathology which could account for
   pain; consider possible obstructing stone as cause as it would not be
   well visualized on CT
   - no abx for now
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma: Neurosurgery following, no acute change from OSH
   imaging, no changes in repeat CT
   - original plan was to transfuse plt's with goal of >80, but pt has no
   evidence of bleeding on recent MRI head, will hold off for now, unless
   NS has different indication
   - INR 1.4, s/p Vit K treatment
   - continue dilantin at an appropriately corrected level; restarted
   lyrica as patient has NGT

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma, severe peripheral neuropathy, and recent falls. She was admitted to the ICU after becoming non-responsive, febrile, and developing atrial fibrillation. Imaging studies revealed acute and subacute infarcts in the brain, likely due to embolic stroke. The patient is being treated for HAP and aspiration pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics. She has a history of recent falls and is at risk for further falls.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure activity: The patient is at risk for seizure activity due to the presence of acute and subacute infarcts in the brain.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of recent falls and is at risk for further falls, which may lead to additional infections.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has pneumonia and is at risk for respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has atrial fibrillation and is at risk for cardiac complications such as stroke or cardiac arrest.
5. Renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease and is at risk for further decline in renal function.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has diarrhea and is at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as sepsis or perforation.
7. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of severe peripheral neuropathy and is at risk for further neurological complications such as myelopathy or neuropathy.
8. Hematological complications: The patient has a history of pancytopenia and is at risk for further hematological complications such as bleeding or infection.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's seizure activity closely and consider administering anticonvulsant medication as needed.
2. Continue antibiotics for the treatment of HAP and aspiration pneumonia.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary.
4. Continue cardiac monitoring and consider adjusting anticoagulation therapy as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider adjusting diuretic therapy as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely and consider administering antidiarrheal medication as needed.
7. Continue neurological monitoring and consider consulting with a neurologist if necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's hematological status closely and consider transfusing blood products as needed.

ICU Care:

1. Nutrition: The patient is receiving enteral nutrition through a nasogastric tube.
2. Glycemic control: The patient's glucose levels are being monitored and controlled as needed.
3. Lines: The patient has a PICC line and two peripheral IV lines.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis.
5. Code status: The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate)."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o F w/ multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls in setting of
   severe peripheral neuropathy who now p/w acute on chronic subdural
   hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.  Transferred back to
   MICU after becoming non responsive, febrile and in afib with [**Year (4 digits) 1978**].
   .
   # AMS - unclear etiology, CT of head negative for change in SDH and
   patient moving all 4 extremities. 24 hour EEG showing spikes that might
   represent subacute status epilepticus. Could be secondary to infection
   as patient is febrile and has known pneumonia.  MRI shows acute and
   subacute infarcts c/w infarcts, no hemorrhagic conversion, which has
   potential to contribute to the AMS. Recent MRI showed nonobstruction
   flow. [**Month (only) 8**] be c.diff in the setting of broad spectrum abx.  Less likely
   meningitis, LP initially negative.  Could be drug effect, although not
   on any sedating meds now except oxybutinin. Could be delirium in
   setting of pain.  Is hemodynamically stable and should have adequate
   perfusion to brain.  LENIs and CTA neg for clots
   - f/u pan cultures of blood, urine, stool
 so far negative
   - f/u LP cultures
 Neg prelim, neg Crypto
   - EEG
 f/u final read
   - Neuro
 start Ativan on top of Dilantin, may take patient to Neuro

   with broad spectrum vanco, cefepime.  Not covering ESBLs.  Also not
   covering fungal infections.
   - f/u cultures
 so far negative

 last dose today [**2157-4-5**]
   - remains hemodynamically stable
   .
   # RUQ pain
 stable, unclear etiology, patient is post cholecystectomy
   so not gallbladder pain.  Could be rib fracture v. pleural pain v.
   colitis vs. pneumonia pain.
   - f/u abdominal ultrasound
 negative
   - CT abd and pelvis did not show pathology which could account for
   pain; consider possible obstructing stone as cause as it would not be
   well visualized on CT
   - no abx for now
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma: Neurosurgery following, no acute change from OSH
   imaging, no changes in repeat CT
   - original plan was to transfuse plt's with goal of >80, but pt has no
   evidence of bleeding on recent MRI head, will hold off for now, unless
   NS has different indication
   - INR 1.4, s/p Vit K treatment
   - continue dilantin at an appropriately corrected level; restarted
   lyrica as patient has NGT
   .
   # Afib with [**Name (NI) 1978**] - unclear precipitating factor, likely in setting of
   fever and new infection.  BPs stable, HRs to 140s.  Not changed with
   metoprolol; responsive to diltiazem
   - Titrating dilt po dose per pharmacy recs
   - echo done earlier in admission, no need to repeat at this time
   - no PE based on CTA
   - EKG without signs of ischemia
   .
   # Respiratory/PNA: Abx treatment included vanco and cefepime started
   [**3-29**].  Did get one dose of ceftriaxone.  Was started on levo for
   atypical coverage on [**3-29**] which was stopped [**4-2**].  Flagyl was started
   [**4-2**]. Culture data only positive for GPCs in sputum, no speciation
   done.  Is oxygentating well.
   - cont vancomycin, cefepime for 7 days (until [**4-5**]) , flagyl d/c
   - oxygen to maintain sats >92%
   - CXR stable

   # Diarrhea: patient had an episode of diarrhea on [**2157-4-4**]
   - C. diff pending
   .
   # Falls/?Syncope: recent admit with extensive work-up attributing LE
   weakness and falls to cervical spondylosis and multilevel degenerative
   disease with myelopathy and neuropathy. Unclear if LOC with fall.
   - Cont. tele
   - MRA of neck done on last admit showing no flow limiting lesions

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma, who was admitted to the ICU with an acute on chronic subdural hematoma, pneumonia, and severe peripheral neuropathy. She has been experiencing frequent falls, and her neurological examination is impaired. She has a prolonged QT interval, atrial fibrillation, and is receiving anticoagulation therapy. She has also been experiencing respiratory failure, oliguria, and RUQ pain.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure activity: The patient's EEG shows variable duration spikes, which may indicate seizure activity. Phenytoin was bolused, and the level will be rechecked in the morning.
2. Spontaneous rebleeding: The patient's platelet count is 30,000/uL, which is below the threshold for transfusion. Neurosurgery is concerned about the risk of spontaneous rebleeding into the subdural hematoma.
3. Infection: The patient has a fever, and cultures are pending. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia, but not covering ESBLs or fungal infections.
4. Oliguria: The patient's urine output is low, and she appears to be volume overloaded. Lasix will be given for diuresis today.
5. RUQ pain: The patient's pain is stable, but unclear etiology. Abdominal ultrasound and CT abdomen and pelvis did not show pathology, but consider possible obstructing stone as a cause.
6. Subdural hematoma: The patient's subdural hematoma is not changing, and Neurosurgery is concerned about the risk of spontaneous rebleeding.
7. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is unclear precipitating factor, but likely related to fever and new infection. Diltiazem is being titrated to control the heart rate.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and is being monitored for respiratory status.
9. Pancytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, and transfusion is being considered.
10. Renal failure: The patient has chronic kidney disease, and her creatinine level is stable at 1.2.
11. Diarrhea: The patient had an episode of diarrhea, and C. diff is pending.
12. Falls/syncope: The patient has a history of falls, and it is unclear if she lost consciousness with the fall.

Recommendations:

1. Continue anticonvulsant therapy with phenytoin and dilantin.
2. Monitor the patient's platelet count and transfuse if necessary.
3. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia.
4. Monitor the patient's urine output and consider diuresis with lasix.
5. Consider further evaluation of RUQ pain, including abdominal ultrasound and CT abdomen and pelvis.
6. Continue atrial fibrillation management with diltiazem.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as necessary.
8. Continue anticoagulation therapy for the subdural hematoma.
9. Consider transfusion of platelets and red blood cells as necessary.
10. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment as necessary.
11. Consider further evaluation of diarrhea, including C. diff testing.
12. Continue to monitor the patient's falls and syncope, and consider further evaluation if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a history of blood loss, abdominal pain, fever, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, and renal failure. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions, antibiotics, and medications to manage their condition. They have been experiencing increased oxygen requirements, tachypnea, and fluid overload, which has been managed with increased fluid and diuretics. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they are still experiencing fever, altered mental status, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's continued fever, altered mental status, and tachypnea may indicate the presence of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death if not managed promptly.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed with adequate fluid management and dialysis.
3. Bleeding: The patient's history of blood loss and continued bleeding may lead to further complications, such as hypovolemic shock and organ failure.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's increased oxygen requirements and tachypnea may indicate the presence of respiratory failure, which can lead to further complications, such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to cardiac complications, such as stroke, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
6. Infection: The patient's positive urine culture and continued fever may indicate the presence of a urinary tract infection, which can lead to further complications, such as sepsis and organ failure.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's abdominal pain and altered mental status may indicate the presence of gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status may indicate the presence of neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or encephalitis.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and manage their care promptly to prevent these potential complications from arising."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o F w/ multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls in setting of
   severe peripheral neuropathy who now p/w acute on chronic subdural
   hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.  Transferred back to
   MICU after becoming non responsive, febrile and in afib with [**Telephone/Fax (3) 1978**].
   .
   # Encephalopathy
 Likely secondary to seizure activity.  MRI showed
   acute on subacute embolic infarcts, which is likely contributing, in
   addition to SDH. LP cultures negative, which speaks against meningitis.
   - f/u pan cultures of blood, urine, stool
 continue to be negative
   - EEG -continuing epileptiform activity, but improved
   - Neuro
 start Ativan on top of Dilantin and Lyrica; dilantin level
   still low, will f/u with Neuro
   - Change Dilantin to fosphenytoin so PICC line obstruction will not
   recur
   - D/c Oxybutinin as anticholineric effects may contribute to AMS, will
   not need as pt has Foley
   .
   # Fever
 Following fever curve, is immunocompromised secondary to
   pulse steroids for MM.  Finished treatment for HAP and aspiration
   pneumonia with broad spectrum vanco, cefepime ([**4-5**]).  Did not cover
   with ESBLs or antifungals.  LENIs and CTA neg for clots
   - f/u cultures
 so far negative
   - remains hemodynamically stable
   - Spiked T on [**2157-4-6**], pan cultured, U/A pos for WBC, LE, Bact ->
   restarted vanc/Zosyn
   .
   # Oliguria
 Had UOP in 20s-30s over first few days. Patient appears to
   be volume up on exam.  Attempted to take off fluid
   - Was given Lasix x2 on [**4-11**] with UOP to 200-300/hr, however Cr incr
   from 1.2 to 1.5
   - Will hold Lasix until infection clears
   - Follow UOP
   .
   # RUQ pain
 stable, unclear etiology, patient is post cholecystectomy
   so not gallbladder pain.  Could be rib fracture v. pleural pain v.
   colitis vs. pneumonia pain. Abdominal ultrasound
 negative. CT abd and
   pelvis did not show pathology which could account for pain; consider
   possible obstructing stone as cause as it would not be well visualized
   on CT
   - no abx for now
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma: Neurosurgery following, no acute change from OSH
   imaging, no changes in repeat CT
   - original plan was to transfuse plt's with goal of >80, but pt has no
   evidence of bleeding on recent MRI head, will hold off for now, unless
   NS has different indication
   - INR 1.4, s/p Vit K treatment
   - continue dilantin at an appropriately corrected level; restarted
   lyrica as patient has NGT
   -F/u with NSurg if repeat imaging needed
   .
   # Afib with [**Name (NI) 1978**] - unclear precipitating factor, likely in setting of
   fever and new infection.  BPs stable, HRs to 140s.  Not changed with
   metoprolol; responsive to diltiazem
   - Titrating dilt po dose per pharmacy recs
   - echo done earlier in admission, no need to repeat at this time
   - no PE based on CTA
   - EKG without signs of ischemia
   .
   # Respiratory/PNA: Abx treatment included vanco and cefepime started
   [**3-29**].  Did get one dose of ceftriaxone.  Was started on levo for
   atypical coverage on [**3-29**] which was stopped [**4-2**].  Flagyl was started
   [**4-2**]. Culture data only positive for GPCs in sputum, no speciation
   done.  Needed incr O2 on [**2157-4-6**], CXR showed incr patchiness on R>L c/w
   probable aspiration pneumonitis and probable fluid overload. Finished 7
   day course of  vancomycin, cefepime (stopped [**4-5**]) , flagyl d/c
   - oxygen to maintain sats >92%
   - F/u CXR, [**2157-4-7**], some improvement after Lasix and O2 requirement down
   to FiO2 35%
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   # Diarrhea: patient had an episode of diarrhea on [**2157-4-4**]
   - C. diff negative x1
   - F/u 2^nd C diff
   .
   # Falls/?Syncope: recent admit with extensive work-up attributing LE
   weakness and falls to cervical spondylosis and multilevel degenerative
   disease with myelopathy and neuropathy. Unclear if LOC with fall. MRA
   of neck done on last admit showing no flow limiting lesions
   - Cont. tele  and monitor resp status
   - dilantin as above for seizure ppx
   .
   # Myeloma: On pulse decadron as per heme-onc for tx of myeloma.
   - Next pulse due in 1 week.
   - will touch base with heme onc about next steroid dose
   .
   # Pancytopenia: [**3-7**] to myeloma.
   - Transfuse platelets with absolute goal > 50K; transfused 1U [**4-6**]
   - Transfuse hct < 21, rcv
d one unit [**2157-4-4**] in AM
   .
   # Renal Failure: At baseline from last admission: 1.1-1.2. Unclear
   etiology to CKD, but may represent complication from myeloma.
   - Trend Cr
   - Cr incr after Lasix x2
   .
   # FEN: NGT TF at goal, replete lytes PRN
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots (no SQ hep d/t SDH), PPI, pneumovax given at
   OSH
   .
   # Access: PIV x 2; will try to resite PICC line.
   .
   # Code: DNR/DNI per discussion with pt
s son on [**2157-4-4**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o F w/ multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls in setting of
   severe peripheral neuropathy who now p/w acute on chronic subdural
   hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.  Transferred back to
   MICU after becoming non responsive, febrile and in afib with [**Telephone/Fax (3) 1978**].
   .
   # Encephalopathy
 Likely secondary to seizure activity.  MRI showed
   acute on subacute embolic infarcts, which is likely contributing, in
   addition to SDH. LP cultures negative, which speaks against meningitis.
   - f/u pan cultures of blood, urine, stool
 continue to be negative
   - EEG -continuing epileptiform activity, but improved
   - Neuro
 start Ativan on top of Dilantin and Lyrica; dilantin level
   still low, will f/u with Neuro
   - Change Dilantin to fosphenytoin so PICC line obstruction will not
   recur
   - D/c Oxybutinin as anticholineric effects may contribute to AMS, will
   not need as pt has Foley
   .
   # Fever
 Following fever curve, is immunocompromised secondary to
   pulse steroids for MM.  Finished treatment for HAP and aspiration
   pneumonia with broad spectrum vanco, cefepime ([**4-5**]).  Did not cover
   with ESBLs or antifungals.  LENIs and CTA neg for clots
   - f/u cultures
 so far negative
   - remains hemodynamically stable
   - Spiked T on [**2157-4-6**], pan cultured, U/A pos for WBC, LE, Bact ->
   restarted vanc/Zosyn
   .
   # Oliguria
 Had UOP in 20s-30s over first few days. Patient appears to
   be volume up on exam.  Attempted to take off fluid
   - Was given Lasix x2 on [**4-11**] with UOP to 200-300/hr, however Cr incr
   from 1.2 to 1.5
   - Will hold Lasix until infection clears
   - Follow UOP
   .
   # RUQ pain
 stable, unclear etiology, patient is post cholecystectomy
   so not gallbladder pain.  Could be rib fracture v. pleural pain v.
   colitis vs. pneumonia pain. Abdominal ultrasound
 negative. CT abd and
   pelvis did not show pathology which could account for pain; consider
   possible obstructing stone as cause as it would not be well visualized
   on CT
   - no abx for now
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma: Neurosurgery following, no acute change from OSH
   imaging, no changes in repeat CT
   - original plan was to transfuse plt's with goal of >80, but pt has no
   evidence of bleeding on recent MRI head, will hold off for now, unless
   NS has different indication
   - INR 1.4, s/p Vit K treatment
   - continue dilantin at an appropriately corrected level; restarted
   lyrica as patient has NGT
   -F/u with NSurg if repeat imaging needed
   .
   # Afib with [**Name (NI) 1978**] - unclear precipitating factor, likely in setting of
   fever and new infection.  BPs stable, HRs to 140s.  Not changed with
   metoprolol; responsive to diltiazem
   - Titrating dilt po dose per pharmacy recs
   - echo done earlier in admission, no need to repeat at this time
   - no PE based on CTA
   - EKG without signs of ischemia
   .
   # Respiratory/PNA: Abx treatment included vanco and cefepime started
   [**3-29**].  Did get one dose of ceftriaxone.  Was started on levo for
   atypical coverage on [**3-29**] which was stopped [**4-2**].  Flagyl was started
   [**4-2**]. Culture data only positive for GPCs in sputum, no speciation
   done.  Needed incr O2 on [**2157-4-6**], CXR showed incr patchiness on R>L c/w
   probable aspiration pneumonitis and probable fluid overload. Finished 7
   day course of  vancomycin, cefepime (stopped [**4-5**]) , flagyl d/c
   - oxygen to maintain sats >92%
   - F/u CXR, [**2157-4-7**], some improvement after Lasix and O2 requirement down
   to FiO2 35%
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   # Diarrhea: patient had an episode of diarrhea on [**2157-4-4**]
   - C. diff negative x1
   - F/u 2^nd C diff
   .
   # Falls/?Syncope: recent admit with extensive work-up attributing LE
   weakness and falls to cervical spondylosis and multilevel degenerative
   disease with myelopathy and neuropathy. Unclear if LOC with fall. MRA
   of neck done on last admit showing no flow limiting lesions
   - Cont. tele  and monitor resp status
   - dilantin as above for seizure ppx
   .
   # Myeloma: On pulse decadron as per heme-onc for tx of myeloma.
   - Next pulse due in 1 week.
   - will touch base with heme onc about next steroid dose
   .
   # Pancytopenia: [**3-7**] to myeloma.
   - Transfuse platelets with absolute goal > 50K; transfused 1U [**4-6**]
   - Transfuse hct < 21, rcv
d one unit [**2157-4-4**] in AM
   .
   # Renal Failure: At baseline from last admission: 1.1-1.2. Unclear
   etiology to CKD, but may represent complication from myeloma.
   - Trend Cr
   - Cr incr after Lasix x2
   .
   # FEN: NGT TF at goal, replete lytes PRN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple comorbidities. The patient has received transfusions of platelets, antibiotics, and has undergone various diagnostic tests.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.7°F, heart rate of 99 bpm, and blood pressure of 124/56 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with a SpO2 of 97% and an ABG showing a pH of 7.41, PaO2 of 389, and PaCO2 of 47 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin individual with no acute distress, but is nonverbal and opens eyes to voice. The patient has an elevated JVP, and the cardiovascular examination is normal. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, and bowel sounds are present.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.1 g/dL and a platelet count of 105 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L and a sodium level of 118 mg/dL. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL and an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level.

The patient's medical conditions include acute anemia secondary to blood loss, abdominal pain, fever, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, and acute renal failure. The patient has a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea may indicate sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's increased oxygen requirement and abnormal ABG results may indicate respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis.
3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and BUN level may indicate worsening renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
4. Infection: The patient's fever and abnormal laboratory results may indicate infection, which can spread to other parts of the body and cause sepsis.
5. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and platelet count may indicate bleeding, which can lead to hemorrhage and shock.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent potential complications and improve the patient's outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o F w/ multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls in setting of
   severe peripheral neuropathy who now p/w acute on chronic subdural
   hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.  Transferred back to
   MICU after becoming non responsive, febrile and in afib with [**Telephone/Fax (3) 1978**].
   .
   # Encephalopathy
 Likely secondary to seizure activity.  CT of head
   negative for change in SDH and patient moving all 4 extremities. LENIs
   and CTA neg for clots
   - f/u pan cultures of blood, urine, stool
 so far negative
   - f/u LP cultures
 Neg prelim, neg Crypto
   - EEG
 f/u final read
   - Neuro
 start Ativan on top of Dilantin and Lyrica; dilantin level
   still low, will f/u with neuron; may take patient to Neuro step-down
   .
   # Fever
 Following fever curve, is immunocompromised secondary to
   pulse steroids for MM.  Finished treatment for HAP and aspiration
   pneumonia with broad spectrum vanco, cefepime ([**4-5**]).  Not covering
   ESBLs.  Also not covering fungal infections.
   - f/u cultures
 so far negative
   - remains hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Oliguria
 Patient appears to be volume up on exam.  Was bolused
   yesterday.  Will give lasix for diuresis today.
   .
   # RUQ pain
 stable, unclear etiology, patient is post cholecystectomy
   so not gallbladder pain.  Could be rib fracture v. pleural pain v.
   colitis vs. pneumonia pain.
   - f/u abdominal ultrasound
 negative
   - CT abd and pelvis did not show pathology which could account for
   pain; consider possible obstructing stone as cause as it would not be
   well visualized on CT
   - no abx for now
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma: Neurosurgery following, no acute change from OSH
   imaging, no changes in repeat CT
   - original plan was to transfuse plt's with goal of >80, but pt has no
   evidence of bleeding on recent MRI head, will hold off for now, unless
   NS has different indication
   - INR 1.4, s/p Vit K treatment
   - continue dilantin at an appropriately corrected level; restarted
   lyrica as patient has NGT
   .
   # Afib with [**Name (NI) 1978**] - unclear precipitating factor, likely in setting of
   fever and new infection.  BPs stable, HRs to 140s.  Not changed with
   metoprolol; responsive to diltiazem
   - Titrating dilt po dose per pharmacy recs
   - echo done earlier in admission, no need to repeat at this time
   - no PE based on CTA
   - EKG without signs of ischemia
   .
   # Respiratory/PNA: Abx treatment included vanco and cefepime started
   [**3-29**].  Did get one dose of ceftriaxone.  Was started on levo for
   atypical coverage on [**3-29**] which was stopped [**4-2**].  Flagyl was started
   [**4-2**]. Culture data only positive for GPCs in sputum, no speciation
   done.  Is oxygentating well.
   - cont vancomycin, cefepime for 7 days (until [**4-5**]) , flagyl d/c
   - oxygen to maintain sats >92%
   - CXR stable
   .
   # Diarrhea: patient had an episode of diarrhea on [**2157-4-4**]
   - C. diff pending
   .
   # Falls/?Syncope: recent admit with extensive work-up attributing LE

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   pain; consider possible obstructing stone as cause as it would not be
   well visualized on CT
   - no abx for now
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma: Neurosurgery following, no acute change from OSH
   imaging, no changes in repeat CT
   - original plan was to transfuse plt's with goal of >80, but pt has no
   evidence of bleeding on recent MRI head, will hold off for now, unless
   NS has different indication
   - INR 1.4, s/p Vit K treatment
   - continue dilantin at an appropriately corrected level; restarted
   lyrica as patient has NGT
   .
   # Afib with [**Name (NI) 1978**] - unclear precipitating factor, likely in setting of
   fever and new infection.  BPs stable, HRs to 140s.  Not changed with
   metoprolol; responsive to diltiazem
   - Titrating dilt po dose per pharmacy recs
   - echo done earlier in admission, no need to repeat at this time
   - no PE based on CTA
   - EKG without signs of ischemia

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. **Infection**: The patient has a fever of 101.7°F, and pan-culture of blood, urine, and stool is pending. The patient is immunocompromised due to pulse steroids for multiple myeloma, which increases the risk of infection. The patient is also on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but the coverage is not optimal, and the patient is not being covered for ESBLs or fungal infections.
2. **Seizure activity**: The patient has continued epileptiform activity on EEG, which may indicate ongoing seizure activity. The patient is on Dilantin and Lyrica, but the Dilantin level is still low. The patient may require further anticonvulsant therapy and monitoring.
3. **Subdural hematoma**: The patient has a subdural hematoma, which is being monitored by neurosurgery. The patient's INR is 1.4, and the patient is on vitamin K treatment. The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
4. **Pneumonia**: The patient has pneumonia, which is being treated with antibiotics. The patient's oxygenation is stable, but the patient may require further monitoring and treatment.
5. **Renal failure**: The patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is at risk for further deterioration. The patient's creatinine level is stable at 1.2, but the patient's electrolytes and fluid status should be closely monitored.
6. **Falls**: The patient has a history of falls, which may be related to their multiple myeloma, peripheral neuropathy, and cervical spondylosis. The patient's fall risk should be assessed and monitored.
7. **Oliguria**: The patient has oliguria, which may be related to their volume status, cardiac function, or underlying kidney disease. The patient's fluid status should be closely monitored, and diuretics may be necessary.
8. **Diarrhea**: The patient has had an episode of diarrhea, which may be related to their antibiotic treatment or underlying gastrointestinal disease. The patient's diarrhea should be monitored and treated as necessary.
9. **Hematological complications**: The patient has pancytopenia, which may increase the risk of bleeding and infection. The patient's platelet count is low, and the patient may require further transfusions.

Overall, the patient is at risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with multiple myeloma, acute on chronic subdural hematoma, atrial fibrillation, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's recent course has been complicated by recurrent fevers, mild leukocytosis, and intermittent pulmonary congestion.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Fever (101.7°F) with cultures taken and antibiotics restarted
* Worsening hypoxemia with IV lasix therapy
* Thrombocytopenia (PLT 43 K/uL)
* Subdural hematoma
* Atrial fibrillation with rate control medication
* Renal failure (creatinine 1.5 mg/dL)
* Abnormal liver function tests (ALT 57, AST 73)
* Abnormal electrolyte levels (sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 4.5 mEq/L)
* Abnormal blood gas results (pH 7.41, pCO2 47 mmHg, pO2 136 mmHg)
* Abnormal imaging studies (CXR showing right-sided effusion)

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis due to the patient's fever, leukocytosis, and abnormal blood cultures
* Respiratory failure due to worsening hypoxemia and pulmonary congestion
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to atrial fibrillation and electrolyte imbalances
* Renal failure progression due to inadequate fluid management and underlying chronic kidney disease
* Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia and ongoing blood loss
* Infection progression due to inadequate antibiotic therapy and ongoing fevers
* Metabolic acidosis or alkalosis due to electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances
* Nutritional deficiencies due to inadequate nutrition and ongoing illness

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing antibiotics for possible pneumonia and UTI
* Monitoring for sepsis and adjusting therapy as needed
* Managing atrial fibrillation with rate control medication
* Monitoring for and treating hypoxemia with IV lasix and oxygen therapy
* Managing renal failure with fluid management and electrolyte correction
* Monitoring for and treating bleeding complications with blood product transfusions and platelet therapy
* Continuing nutrition support with a pulmonary diet and regular insulin sliding scale
* Monitoring for and treating infection progression with antibiotic therapy and wound care
* Maintaining aspiration precautions and npo status to prevent further aspiration pneumonitis and pneumonia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has a history of bleeding and has undergone multiple surgeries, which has resulted in significant blood loss. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 93 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 94/52 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is also compromised, with a respiratory rate of 39 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 93%.

The patient's neurological status is deteriorating, with minimal gag reflex and decreased mental status. The patient's renal function is compromised, with a creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 36 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with elevated potassium and phosphorus levels.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, acute kidney injury, and liver dysfunction. The patient's coagulation profile is also abnormal, with a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT).

The patient's medical conditions include acute anemia, acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation, and altered mental status. The patient is also at risk for developing sepsis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's treatment plan includes ongoing hemodynamic monitoring, fluid management, and respiratory support. The patient is also receiving antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and anticoagulation therapy. The patient's nutrition is being managed with a pulmonary diet, and glycemic control is being maintained with insulin therapy.

Based on the patient's condition, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate the presence of an infection. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and death if not promptly treated.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and the patient is at risk for developing VAP, which can lead to pneumonia and death.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, and the patient is at risk for developing DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and death.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and the patient is at risk for developing renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and death.
5. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver function is abnormal, and the patient is at risk for developing liver failure, which can lead to coagulopathy and death.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is severe, and the patient is at risk for developing anemia-related complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
7. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is untreated, and the patient is at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output.
8. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is deteriorating, and the patient is at risk for developing delirium, which can lead to increased mortality and morbidity.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient's condition is unstable, and the patient is at risk for developing multiple medical complications. Close monitoring and prompt treatment are necessary to prevent and manage these complications and to improve the patient's outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition remains critical. The patient's mental status has deteriorated, with minimal gag reflex and tachycardia despite being maximized on diltiazem and metoprolol. The patient's urine output has decreased, with blood-tinged urine, and creatinine levels have increased to 2.2 mg/dL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* Anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL
* Elevated potassium (K) and phosphorus (Phos) levels
* Elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels
* Elevated creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels
* Elevated liver enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
* Elevated troponin-T level, indicating cardiac injury
* Elevated lipase level, indicating pancreatic injury

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their altered mental status and decreased responsiveness. The patient's respiratory status remains stable, with a SpO2 of 93% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Further decline in mental status and respiratory function
* Development of sepsis or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) due to the patient's elevated WBC and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels
* Worsening of renal function and potential need for dialysis
* Development of cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure due to the patient's elevated troponin-T level
* Development of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to the patient's altered mental status and decreased responsiveness
* Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's immobility and elevated risk factors

Given the patient's critical condition, close monitoring and management of their respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal functions are essential. Additionally, the patient's family should be educated on the patient's condition and potential complications, and a plan for end-of-life care should be discussed and implemented as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o F w/ multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls in setting of
   severe peripheral neuropathy who now p/w acute on chronic subdural
   hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.  Transferred back to
   MICU after becoming non responsive, febrile and in afib with [**Year (4 digits) 1978**].
   .
   # Encephalopathy
 Likely secondary to seizure activity.  MRI showed
   acute on subacute embolic infarcts, which is likely contributing, in
   addition to SDH. LP cultures negative, which speaks against meningitis.
   Worsening MS as patient has diminished gag and min response to pain.
   - f/u pan cultures of blood, urine, stool
 continue to be negative
   - EEG
d per Neuro
   - Neuro
 cont Ativan on top of Dilantin and Lyrica; dilantin level
   still low, will f/u with Neuro
   - Changed Dilantin to fosphenytoin so PICC line obstruction will not
   recur
   - D/c Oxybutinin as anticholineric effects may contribute to AMS, will
   not need as pt has Foley
   .
   # Fever
 Following fever curve, is immunocompromised secondary to
   pulse steroids for MM.  Finished treatment for HAP and aspiration
   pneumonia with broad spectrum vanco, cefepime ([**4-5**]).  Did not cover
   with ESBLs or antifungals.  LENIs and CTA neg for clots
   - f/u cultures
 so far negative
   - remains hemodynamically stable
   - Spiked T on [**2157-4-6**], pan cultured, U/A pos for WBC, LE, Bact ->
   restarted vanc/Zosyn
   .
   # Oliguria
 Had UOP in 20s-30s over first few days. Patient appears to
   be volume up on exam.  Attempted to take off fluid
   - Was given Lasix x2 on [**4-11**] with UOP to 200-300/hr, however Cr incr
   from 1.2 to 1.5. Now oliguric after Lasix with hematuria and Cr rising
   to 2.2 c/w ARF
   - Will hold Lasix
   - Follow UOP
   - U/S bladder and flush Foley
   .
   # RUQ pain
 stable, unclear etiology, patient is post cholecystectomy
   so not gallbladder pain.  Could be rib fracture v. pleural pain v.
   colitis vs. pneumonia pain. Abdominal ultrasound
 negative. CT abd and
   pelvis did not show pathology which could account for pain; consider
   possible obstructing stone as cause as it would not be well visualized
   on CT
   - no abx for now
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma: Neurosurgery following, no acute change from OSH
   imaging, no changes in repeat CT
   - original plan was to transfuse plt's with goal of >80, but pt has no
   evidence of bleeding on recent MRI head, will hold off for now, unless
   NS has different indication
   - INR 1.4, s/p Vit K treatment
   - continue dilantin at an appropriately corrected level; restarted
   lyrica as patient has NGT
   - NSurg input: would consider taking pt to OR if rebleeds, if family
   wishes
   .
   # Afib with [**Name (NI) 1978**] - unclear precipitating factor, likely in setting of
   fever and new infection.  BPs stable, HRs to 140s.  Not changed with
   metoprolol; responsive to diltiazem
   - Titrating dilt po dose per pharmacy recs
   - Added metoprolol with good effect
   - echo done earlier in admission, no need to repeat at this time
   - no PE based on CTA
   - EKG without signs of ischemia
   .
   # Respiratory/PNA: Abx treatment included vanco and cefepime started
   [**3-29**].  Did get one dose of ceftriaxone.  Was started on levo for
   atypical coverage on [**3-29**] which was stopped [**4-2**].  Flagyl was started
   [**4-2**]. Culture data only positive for GPCs in sputum, no speciation
   done.  Needed incr O2 on [**2157-4-6**], CXR showed incr patchiness on R>L c/w
   probable aspiration pneumonitis and probable fluid overload. Finished 7
   day course of  vancomycin, cefepime (stopped [**4-5**]) , flagyl d/c
   - oxygen to maintain sats >92%
   - F/u CXR, [**2157-4-7**], some improvement after Lasix and O2 requirement down
   to FiO2 35%
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   # Diarrhea: patient had an episode of diarrhea on [**2157-4-4**]
   - C. diff negative x1
   - F/u 2^nd C diff
   .
   # Falls/?Syncope: recent admit with extensive work-up attributing LE
   weakness and falls to cervical spondylosis and multilevel degenerative
   disease with myelopathy and neuropathy. Unclear if LOC with fall. MRA
   of neck done on last admit showing no flow limiting lesions
   - Cont. tele  and monitor resp status
   - dilantin as above for seizure ppx
   .
   # Myeloma: On pulse decadron as per heme-onc for tx of myeloma.
   - Next pulse due in 1 week.
   - will touch base with heme onc about next steroid dose
   .
   # Pancytopenia: [**3-7**] to myeloma.
   - Transfuse platelets with absolute goal > 50K; transfused 1U [**4-6**]
   - Transfuse hct < 21, rcv
d one unit [**2157-4-4**] in AM
   .
   # Renal Failure: Baseline from last admission: 1.1-1.2. Unclear
   etiology to CKD, but may represent complication from myeloma.
   - Trend Cr
   - Cr incr after Lasix, and now incr K, phos and Cr to 2.2
   .
   # FEN: NGT TF at goal, replete lytes PRN
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots (no SQ hep d/t SDH), PPI, pneumovax given at
   OSH
   .
   # Access: PIV x 2; will try to resite PICC line.
   .
   # Code: DNR/DNI per discussion with pt

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma, frequent falls, and severe peripheral neuropathy. She was admitted to the ICU with acute on chronic subdural hematoma, pneumonia, and encephalopathy. She has been experiencing fever, oliguria, RUQ pain, and AFib. Her medical condition has been complicated by immunocompromise, pancytopenia, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's fever and positive blood cultures suggest the possibility of infection, which may be related to her immunocompromised state.
2. Oliguria: The patient's decreasing urine output and rising creatinine levels indicate acute kidney injury, which may be due to her underlying medical conditions or the use of Lasix.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's need for increased oxygen and her respiratory symptoms suggest the possibility of respiratory failure.
4. Seizure activity: The patient's encephalopathy and EEG findings suggest the possibility of seizure activity, which may be related to her underlying medical conditions or the use of anticonvulsant medications.
5. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's subdural hematoma and platelet count may increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications, such as bleeding or gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's elevated potassium and phosphate levels may indicate an electrolyte imbalance, which may be related to her underlying medical conditions or the use of certain medications.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's chest x-ray findings suggest the possibility of pneumonia, which may be related to her underlying medical conditions or the use of certain medications.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's RUQ pain and elevated liver enzymes may indicate the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding or cholecystitis.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. The patient's medical team should continue to monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to assess her condition and adjust her treatment plan as necessary. The patient's family should be informed of her condition and treatment plan, and the patient's son should be involved in her care as her healthcare proxy."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o F w/ multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls in setting of
   severe peripheral neuropathy who now p/w acute on chronic subdural
   hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.  Transferred back to
   MICU after becoming non responsive, febrile and in afib with [**Year (4 digits) 1978**].
   .
   # Encephalopathy
 Likely secondary to seizure activity.  MRI showed
   acute on subacute embolic infarcts, which is likely contributing, in
   addition to SDH. LP cultures negative, which speaks against meningitis.
   Worsening MS as patient has diminished gag and min response to pain.
   - f/u pan cultures of blood, urine, stool
 continue to be negative
   - EEG
d per Neuro
   - Neuro
 cont Ativan on top of Dilantin and Lyrica; dilantin level
   still low, will f/u with Neuro
   - Changed Dilantin to fosphenytoin so PICC line obstruction will not
   recur
   - D/c Oxybutinin as anticholineric effects may contribute to AMS, will
   not need as pt has Foley
   .
   # Fever
 Following fever curve, is immunocompromised secondary to
   pulse steroids for MM.  Finished treatment for HAP and aspiration
   pneumonia with broad spectrum vanco, cefepime ([**4-5**]).  Did not cover
   with ESBLs or antifungals.  LENIs and CTA neg for clots
   - f/u cultures
 so far negative
   - remains hemodynamically stable
   - Spiked T on [**2157-4-6**], pan cultured, U/A pos for WBC, LE, Bact ->
   restarted vanc/Zosyn
   .
   # Oliguria
 Had UOP in 20s-30s over first few days. Patient appears to
   be volume up on exam.  Attempted to take off fluid
   - Was given Lasix x2 on [**4-11**] with UOP to 200-300/hr, however Cr incr
   from 1.2 to 1.5. Now oliguric after Lasix with hematuria and Cr rising
   to 2.2 c/w ARF
   - Will hold Lasix
   - Follow UOP
   - U/S bladder and flush Foley if obstructed
   .
   # RUQ pain
 stable, unclear etiology, patient is post cholecystectomy
   so not gallbladder pain.  Could be rib fracture v. pleural pain v.
   colitis vs. pneumonia pain. Abdominal ultrasound
 negative. CT abd and
   pelvis did not show pathology which could account for pain; consider
   possible obstructing stone as cause as it would not be well visualized
   on CT
   - no abx for now
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma: Neurosurgery following, no acute change from OSH
   imaging, no changes in repeat CT
   - original plan was to transfuse plt's with goal of >80, but pt has no
   evidence of bleeding on recent MRI head, will hold off for now, unless
   NS has different indication
   - INR 1.4, s/p Vit K treatment
   - continue dilantin at an appropriately corrected level; restarted
   lyrica as patient has NGT
   - NSurg input: would consider taking pt to OR if rebleeds, if family
   wishes
   .
   # Afib with [**Name (NI) 1978**] - unclear precipitating factor, likely in setting of
   fever and new infection.  BPs stable, HRs to 140s.  Not changed with
   metoprolol; responsive to diltiazem
   - Titrating dilt po dose per pharmacy recs
   - Added metoprolol with good effect
   - echo done earlier in admission, no need to repeat at this time
   - no PE based on CTA
   - EKG without signs of ischemia
   .
   # Respiratory/PNA: Abx treatment included vanco and cefepime started
   [**3-29**].  Did get one dose of ceftriaxone.  Was started on levo for
   atypical coverage on [**3-29**] which was stopped [**4-2**].  Flagyl was started
   [**4-2**]. Culture data only positive for GPCs in sputum, no speciation
   done.  Needed incr O2 on [**2157-4-6**], CXR showed incr patchiness on R>L c/w
   probable aspiration pneumonitis and probable fluid overload. Finished 7
   day course of  vancomycin, cefepime (stopped [**4-5**]) , flagyl d/c
   - oxygen to maintain sats >92%
   - F/u CXR, [**2157-4-7**], some improvement after Lasix and O2 requirement down
   to FiO2 35%
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn
   - Worsening respiratory effort, will recheck venous blood gas
   .

   - C. diff negative x1
   - F/u 2^nd C diff
   .
   # Falls/?Syncope: recent admit with extensive work-up attributing LE
   weakness and falls to cervical spondylosis and multilevel degenerative

   # Myeloma: On pulse decadron as per heme-onc for tx of myeloma.
   - Next pulse due in 1 week.
   - will touch base with heme onc about next steroid dose
   .
   # Pancytopenia: [**3-7**] to myeloma.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o F w/ multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls in setting of
   severe peripheral neuropathy who now p/w acute on chronic subdural
   hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.  Transferred back to
   MICU after becoming non responsive, febrile and in afib with [**Year (4 digits) 1978**].
   .
   # Encephalopathy
 Likely secondary to seizure activity.  MRI showed
   acute on subacute embolic infarcts, which is likely contributing, in
   addition to SDH. LP cultures negative, which speaks against meningitis.
   Worsening MS as patient has diminished gag and min response to pain.
   - f/u pan cultures of blood, urine, stool
 continue to be negative
   - EEG
d per Neuro
   - Neuro
 cont Ativan on top of Dilantin and Lyrica; dilantin level
   still low, will f/u with Neuro
   - Changed Dilantin to fosphenytoin so PICC line obstruction will not
   recur
   - D/c Oxybutinin as anticholineric effects may contribute to AMS, will
   not need as pt has Foley
   .
   # Fever
 Following fever curve, is immunocompromised secondary to
   pulse steroids for MM.  Finished treatment for HAP and aspiration
   pneumonia with broad spectrum vanco, cefepime ([**4-5**]).  Did not cover
   with ESBLs or antifungals.  LENIs and CTA neg for clots
   - f/u cultures
 so far negative
   - remains hemodynamically stable
   - Spiked T on [**2157-4-6**], pan cultured, U/A pos for WBC, LE, Bact ->
   restarted vanc/Zosyn
   .
   # Oliguria
 Had UOP in 20s-30s over first few days. Patient appears to
   be volume up on exam.  Attempted to take off fluid
   - Was given Lasix x2 on [**4-11**] with UOP to 200-300/hr, however Cr incr
   from 1.2 to 1.5. Now oliguric after Lasix with hematuria and Cr rising
   to 2.2 c/w ARF
   - Will hold Lasix
   - Follow UOP
   - U/S bladder and flush Foley if obstructed
   .
   # RUQ pain
 stable, unclear etiology, patient is post cholecystectomy
   so not gallbladder pain.  Could be rib fracture v. pleural pain v.
   colitis vs. pneumonia pain. Abdominal ultrasound
 negative. CT abd and
   pelvis did not show pathology which could account for pain; consider
   possible obstructing stone as cause as it would not be well visualized
   on CT
   - no abx for now
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma: Neurosurgery following, no acute change from OSH
   imaging, no changes in repeat CT
   - original plan was to transfuse plt's with goal of >80, but pt has no
   evidence of bleeding on recent MRI head, will hold off for now, unless
   NS has different indication
   - INR 1.4, s/p Vit K treatment
   - continue dilantin at an appropriately corrected level; restarted
   lyrica as patient has NGT
   - NSurg input: would consider taking pt to OR if rebleeds, if family
   wishes
   .
   # Afib with [**Name (NI) 1978**] - unclear precipitating factor, likely in setting of
   fever and new infection.  BPs stable, HRs to 140s.  Not changed with
   metoprolol; responsive to diltiazem
   - Titrating dilt po dose per pharmacy recs
   - Added metoprolol with good effect
   - echo done earlier in admission, no need to repeat at this time
   - no PE based on CTA
   - EKG without signs of ischemia
   .
   # Respiratory/PNA: Abx treatment included vanco and cefepime started
   [**3-29**].  Did get one dose of ceftriaxone.  Was started on levo for
   atypical coverage on [**3-29**] which was stopped [**4-2**].  Flagyl was started
   [**4-2**]. Culture data only positive for GPCs in sputum, no speciation
   done.  Needed incr O2 on [**2157-4-6**], CXR showed incr patchiness on R>L c/w
   probable aspiration pneumonitis and probable fluid overload. Finished 7
   day course of  vancomycin, cefepime (stopped [**4-5**]) , flagyl d/c
   - oxygen to maintain sats >92%
   - F/u CXR, [**2157-4-7**], some improvement after Lasix and O2 requirement down
   to FiO2 35%
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn
   - Worsening respiratory effort, will recheck venous blood gas
   .
   # Diarrhea: patient had an episode of diarrhea on [**2157-4-4**]
   - C. diff negative x1
   - F/u 2^nd C diff
   .
   # Falls/?Syncope: recent admit with extensive work-up attributing LE
   weakness and falls to cervical spondylosis and multilevel degenerative
   disease with myelopathy and neuropathy. Unclear if LOC with fall. MRA
   of neck done on last admit showing no flow limiting lesions
   - Cont. tele  and monitor resp status
   - dilantin as above for seizure ppx
   .
   # Myeloma: On pulse decadron as per heme-onc for tx of myeloma.
   - Next pulse due in 1 week.
   - will touch base with heme onc about next steroid dose
   .
   # Pancytopenia: [**3-7**] to myeloma.
   - Transfuse platelets with absolute goal > 50K; transfused 1U [**4-6**]
   - Transfuse hct < 21, rcv
d one unit [**2157-4-4**] in AM
   .
   # Renal Failure: Baseline from last admission: 1.1-1.2. Unclear
   etiology to CKD, but may represent complication from myeloma.
   - Trend Cr
   - Cr incr after Lasix, and now incr K, phos and Cr to 2.2
   .
   # FEN: NGT TF at goal, replete lytes PRN
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots (no SQ hep d/t SDH), PPI, pneumovax given at
   OSH
   .
   # Access: PIV x 2; will try to resite PICC line.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with multiple myeloma, who was admitted to the ICU due to an unwitnessed fall, acute on chronic subdural hematoma, and pneumonia. She has a history of severe peripheral neuropathy, frequent recent falls, and is immunocompromised due to pulse steroids for myeloma treatment. The patient is currently experiencing encephalopathy, likely secondary to seizure activity, and has been treated with anticonvulsants and antibiotics. She is also experiencing fever, oliguria, RUQ pain, and respiratory failure. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and she has developed acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure activity: The patient's encephalopathy is likely secondary to seizure activity, and she may continue to experience seizures if not properly managed.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's Cr level has increased to 2.2, and she is experiencing oliguria, which may indicate ARF. This may require further management with dialysis and electrolyte replacement.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen requirements have increased, and she is experiencing worsening respiratory effort. This may require further management with oxygen therapy and respiratory support.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of immunocompromise and is at risk for developing further infections. She has been treated with antibiotics, but further monitoring and management may be necessary.
5. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding due to her myeloma and may continue to experience bleeding complications if not properly managed.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and she may require further management with electrolyte replacement and monitoring.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and may be at risk for developing further cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or stroke.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a history of diarrhea and may be at risk for developing further gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation or malnutrition."
