   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 y/o woman with PMH notable for type 2 DM, hypertension,
   and recent NSTEMI in setting of hypoglycemia admitted with multiple
   episodes of BRBPR.
   .
   # GI bleeding: Decreased melanotic stools overnight but continues to
   have hematocrit drops. Since the patient did not complete her GI prep
   will not get colonoscopy today, but will instead order bleeding scan
   given her persistent anemia despite 3U blood. Currently getting 2 more
   units this AM.
   - maintain 2 18 g PIVs
   - recheck hct 4 hrs post 2^nd unti
   - bleeding scan
   - f/u GI recs for today
   - ppi [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - NPO
   .
   # Recent NSTEMI: Patient had cardiac enzyme elevation on prior
   admission. EKG unchanged on arrival and no overt symptoms of ischemia.
   CE negative
   - transfuse for hct<28
   - hold aspirin for now
   - hold beta blocker so that tachycardia not masked
   - continue pravastatin
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Hold home metformin while hospitalized. Elevated blood
   sugars overnight.
   - increase sliding scale insulin & fingersticks four times daily
   .
   # Hypertension: Normotensive overnight for the most part. Patient on
   toprol XL and cozaar as outpatient.
   - hold beta blocker
   - if persistently hypertension, could restart cozaar, potentially at
   lower dose

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and recent NSTEMI. She was admitted with multiple episodes of BRBPR and has been experiencing GI bleeding, with decreased melanotic stools overnight but still having hematocrit drops. She has received 3U blood and is scheduled to receive 2 more units. She has also been ordered to have a bleeding scan. Her recent NSTEMI is being managed with medication and cardiac enzyme elevation. Her type 2 diabetes is being managed with insulin and fingersticks. Her hypertension is being managed with medication, and her blood pressure is stable. She is currently NPO and will be repleted with lytes as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued GI bleeding: The patient's hematocrit is still dropping despite receiving blood transfusions, and she is at risk for continued bleeding.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but she is at risk for hemodynamic instability due to her ongoing bleeding and potential cardiac issues.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her prolonged hospitalization and potential GI bleeding.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's recent NSTEMI is a concern, and she may be at risk for further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
5. Metabolic complications: The patient's type 2 diabetes is being managed with insulin and fingersticks, but she is at risk for metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient is at risk for respiratory complications due to her prolonged hospitalization and potential respiratory issues.
7. Neurological complications: The patient is at risk for neurological complications due to her prolonged hospitalization and potential neurological issues."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 y/o woman with PMH notable for type 2 DM, hypertension,
   and recent NSTEMI in setting of hypoglycemia admitted with multiple
   episodes of BRBPR.
   .
   # GI bleeding: Appears to be lower GI bleeding given history. The
   patient does have multiple diverticula on prior colonoscopy, making
   this the most likely source. She also had rectal ulceration in prior
   colonoscopy and rectal pain could correlate with a recurrence of this.
   Less likely is upper GI bleeding but does use ibuprofen for arthritis
   at times.
   - maintain 2 18 g PIVs
   - active T&C, 2 U PRBCs ordered in the ED
   - recheck hct 4 hours after blood complete & q6h therafter
   - appreciate GI input
   - prep for colonoscopy tomorrow, golytely starting this afternoon
   - ppi [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - clears this afternoon, NPO after midnight
   - if large volume bleeding or patient unstable, plan for transfusion
   and will likely need bleeding scan/possible angio
   .
   # Recent NSTEMI: Patient had cardiac enzyme elevation on prior
   admission. EKG unchanged on arrival and no overt symptoms of ischemia.
   Getting transfused with goal Hct 28.
   - repeat CEs with evening Hct
   - ekg tomorrow am
   - hold aspirin for now
   - hold beta blocker so that tachycardia not masked
   - continue pravastatin
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Hold home metformin while hospitalized.
   - sliding scale insulin & fingersticks four times daily
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient on toprol XL and cozaar as outpatient.
   - hold beta blocker
   - if persistently hypertension, could restart cozaar, potentially at
   lower dose
   .
   # FEN: NPO after midnight, clears this afternoon, replete lytes prn

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with multiple episodes of bloody rectal bleeding (BRBPR), recent NSTEMI, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. She has a history of diverticula and rectal ulceration on prior colonoscopy, making lower GI bleeding the most likely source. She is receiving transfusions to achieve a goal Hct of 28 and is being prepared for colonoscopy tomorrow. Her recent NSTEMI is being managed with aspirin hold, beta blocker hold, and continued pravastatin. She is also being managed for type 2 diabetes with sliding scale insulin and fingersticks, and hypertension with hold on beta blocker and potential restart of cozaar at a lower dose.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhagic Shock: The patient's ongoing GI bleeding may lead to hemorrhagic shock, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
2. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's blood product transfusions may lead to electrolyte imbalances, particularly potassium and magnesium.
3. Infection: The patient's recent NSTEMI and GI bleeding may increase her risk of developing an infection, particularly sepsis.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's recent NSTEMI and ongoing cardiac enzyme elevation may lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
5. GI Complications: The patient's ongoing GI bleeding may lead to further complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
6. Metabolic Complications: The patient's type 2 diabetes and ongoing glycemic control may lead to metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's ongoing respiratory support may lead to respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or respiratory failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 y/o woman with PMH notable for type 2 DM, hypertension,
   and recent NSTEMI in setting of hypoglycemia admitted with multiple
   episodes of BRBPR.
   .
   # GI bleeding: Appears to be lower GI bleeding given history. The
   patient does have multiple diverticula on prior colonoscopy, making
   this the most likely source. She also had rectal ulceration in prior
   colonoscopy and rectal pain could correlate with a recurrence of this.
   Less likely is upper GI bleeding but does use ibuprofen for arthritis
   at times.
   - maintain 2 18 g PIVs
   - active T&C, 2 U PRBCs ordered in the ED
   - recheck hct 4 hours after blood complete & q6h therafter
   - appreciate GI input
   - prep for colonoscopy tomorrow, golytely starting this afternoon
   - ppi [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - clears this afternoon, NPO after midnight
   - if large volume bleeding or patient unstable, plan for transfusion
   and will likely need bleeding scan/possible angio
   .
   # Recent NSTEMI: Patient had cardiac enzyme elevation on prior
   admission. EKG unchanged on arrival and no overt symptoms of ischemia.
   Getting transfused with goal Hct 28.
   - repeat CEs with evening Hct
   - ekg tomorrow am
   - hold aspirin for now
   - hold beta blocker so that tachycardia not masked
   - continue pravastatin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with multiple episodes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleeding), recent NSTEMI, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hypoglycemia. She has been extubated and is off pressors. Her hemoglobin (Hct) level has improved from 25.0% to 27.2%. She has been started on golytely for colonoscopy preparation and is being monitored for further bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued GI bleeding: The patient's history of diverticula and rectal ulceration increases the risk of recurrent bleeding. Close monitoring of stool output and abdominal examination is necessary to detect any further bleeding.
2. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's Hct level is still low, and further bleeding could lead to hypovolemic shock. Close monitoring of vital signs, especially blood pressure and heart rate, is necessary to detect early signs of shock.
3. Infection: The patient's history of NSTEMI and recent hospitalization increases the risk of infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, especially temperature, and laboratory results is necessary to detect early signs of infection.
4. Metabolic complications: The patient's type 2 diabetes requires close monitoring of blood glucose levels to prevent hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. The patient is on sliding scale insulin and fingersticks four times daily, and her blood glucose levels should be closely monitored.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's recent NSTEMI and ongoing cardiac enzyme elevation increase the risk of cardiac complications. Close monitoring of cardiac enzymes and electrocardiogram (EKG) is necessary to detect early signs of cardiac complications.
6. Renal complications: The patient's history of hypertension and recent hospitalization increases the risk of renal complications. Close monitoring of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels is necessary to detect early signs of renal dysfunction.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of diverticula and rectal ulceration increases the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as perforation or obstruction. Close monitoring of abdominal examination and imaging studies is necessary to detect early signs of gastrointestinal complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 83-year-old woman, is admitted to the ICU with a history of type 2 DM, hypertension, and recent NSTEMI. She has multiple episodes of BRBPR and has not completed her GI prep for colonoscopy. Her hematocrit has decreased, and she has received 3 units of blood. She is currently receiving 2 more units of blood and will have a bleeding scan to evaluate the cause of her anemia. She has elevated blood sugars and is being treated with sliding scale insulin and fingersticks. She has hypertension and is being treated with toprol XL and cozaar. She has a recent NSTEMI and has had cardiac enzyme elevation on prior admission. She has a code status of full code.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's persistent anemia and BRBPR suggest ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. This could lead to further blood loss, hypovolemic shock, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's decreased hematocrit and blood loss could lead to hypovolemic shock, which can cause decreased cardiac output, hypotension, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Infection: The patient's recent NSTEMI and gastrointestinal bleeding increase her risk of developing an infection, which could lead to sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's recent NSTEMI and hypertension increase her risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's hypertension and recent NSTEMI increase her risk of developing respiratory complications, such as pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and potentially life-threatening respiratory failure.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's recent NSTEMI and hypertension increase her risk of developing neurological complications, such as stroke, transient ischemic attack, and potentially life-threatening neurological deficits.
7. Diabetic complications: The patient's type 2 DM and recent NSTEMI increase her risk of developing diabetic complications, such as hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, diabetic ketoacidosis, and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Renal complications: The patient's hypertension and recent NSTEMI increase her risk of developing renal complications, such as acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and potentially life-threatening complications.
9. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent NSTEMI and gastrointestinal bleeding increase her risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as perforation, abscess, and potentially life-threatening complications.
10. Psychosocial complications: The patient's recent hospitalization and medical complications could lead to psychosocial complications, such as depression, anxiety, and potentially life-threatening complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU with an unknown primary diagnosis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.2°F (36.8°C), heart rate of 76 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 153/63 mmHg.

The patient has a history of allergies to ace inhibitors, and has received pantoprazole (Protonix) for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). They have also received infusions of unknown medications.

The patient's lab results show a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 8.7 g/dL, which is lower than the normal range. The white blood cell (WBC) count is 8.0 K/uL, and the platelet count is 209 K/uL. The creatinine (Cr) level is 0.9 mg/dL, and the troponin-T level is <0.01 ng/mL. The patient's blood glucose level is 194 mg/dL, and their calcium (Ca++) level is 8.6 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the fact that the patient's peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic exams were not assessed.

The patient's assessment and plan include ineffective coping, knowledge deficit, gastrointestinal bleed, lower (hematochezia, brbpr, gi bleed, gib), and diabetes mellitus, type II.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and they have a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. This can lead to further bleeding, anemia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Infection: The patient's WBC count is elevated, which can indicate an infection. This can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is high, which can lead to hypoglycemia if not properly managed. This can cause seizures, coma, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's calcium and magnesium levels are abnormal, which can lead to electrolyte imbalance. This can cause muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, which can lead to anemia. This can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Organ failure: The patient's underlying conditions, such as diabetes and gastrointestinal bleeding, can lead to organ failure. This can cause multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, which can be life-threatening.

Based on the patient's conditions and potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, lab results, and physical examination. The patient's care plan should include management of their gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, anemia, and organ failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 y/o woman with PMH notable for type 2 DM, hypertension,
   and recent NSTEMI in setting of hypoglycemia admitted with multiple
   episodes of BRBPR.
   .
   # GI bleeding: Decreased melanotic stools overnight but continues to
   have hematocrit drops. Since the patient did not complete her GI prep
   will not get colonoscopy today, but will instead order bleeding scan
   given her persistent anemia despite 3U blood. Currently getting 2 more
   units this AM.
   - maintain 2 18 g PIVs
   - recheck hct 4 hrs post 2^nd unti
   - bleeding scan
   - f/u GI recs for today
   - ppi [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - NPO
   .
   # Recent NSTEMI: Patient had cardiac enzyme elevation on prior
   admission. EKG unchanged on arrival and no overt symptoms of ischemia.
   CE negative
   - transfuse for hct<28
   - hold aspirin for now
   - hold beta blocker so that tachycardia not masked
   - continue pravastatin
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Hold home metformin while hospitalized. Elevated blood
   sugars overnight.
   - increase sliding scale insulin & fingersticks four times daily
   .
   # Hypertension: Normotensive overnight for the most part. Patient on

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 83 y/o woman with PMH notable for type 2 DM, hypertension,
   and recent NSTEMI in setting of hypoglycemia admitted with multiple
   episodes of BRBPR.
   .
   # GI bleeding: Decreased melanotic stools overnight but continues to
   have hematocrit drops. Since the patient did not complete her GI prep
   will not get colonoscopy today, but will instead order bleeding scan
   given her persistent anemia despite 3U blood. Currently getting 2 more
   units this AM.
   - maintain 2 18 g PIVs
   - recheck hct 4 hrs post 2^nd unti
   - bleeding scan
   - f/u GI recs for today
   - ppi [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - NPO
   .
   # Recent NSTEMI: Patient had cardiac enzyme elevation on prior
   admission. EKG unchanged on arrival and no overt symptoms of ischemia.
   CE negative
   - transfuse for hct<28
   - hold aspirin for now
   - hold beta blocker so that tachycardia not masked
   - continue pravastatin
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Hold home metformin while hospitalized. Elevated blood
   sugars overnight.
   - increase sliding scale insulin & fingersticks four times daily
   .
   # Hypertension: Normotensive overnight for the most part. Patient on
   toprol XL and cozaar as outpatient.
   - hold beta blocker
   - if persistently hypertension, could restart cozaar, potentially at
   lower dose

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and recent NSTEMI, admitted with multiple episodes of BRBPR. She has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, and hypovolemic shock. She has refused to complete her GI prep and has not been able to drink enough Go lytely for a colonoscopy. Her HCT has increased to 34, and she has been receiving blood transfusions. She has also been experiencing tachycardia and hypertension, which is being managed with medication. Her blood sugars have been elevated, and she is being treated with sliding scale insulin. She has been NPO and is awaiting a bleeding scan.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhagic Shock: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia could lead to further hypovolemic shock, which could be life-threatening.
2. Infection: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and recent NSTEMI could increase her risk of developing an infection, such as sepsis.
3. Kidney Injury: The patient's hypovolemic shock and ongoing bleeding could lead to kidney injury or acute kidney injury.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension could lead to respiratory failure, especially if she experiences further bleeding or shock.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's recent NSTEMI and ongoing bleeding could lead to further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
6. Metabolic Complications: The patient's type 2 diabetes and elevated blood sugars could lead to metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (HHNS) or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
7. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's NPO status and ongoing bleeding could lead to nutritional deficiencies, especially in protein and calories.

Based on this summary and potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her bleeding, blood sugars, and electrolytes. Further evaluation and treatment, such as a bleeding scan and colonoscopy, are necessary to determine the cause of her gastrointestinal bleeding and to prevent further complications."
