   Assessment and Plan
   61M w DLBCL s/p multiple doses of chemotherapy w hospital course c/b
   AF/RVR, hypercalcemia, and upper extremity DVT, who is being
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with afib with RVR in the setting of hypotension.
   # Hypotension: unclear etiology, likely in the setting of afib with
   RVR, poor po intake, possible sepsis although no fevers.
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - TTE
   - no aline for now per pt and wife's wishes.
   # Atrial fibrillation w RVR: recurrent in the setting of hypovolemia vs
   malignant pericardial effusions vs infection. Converted overnight to
   NSR s/p amiodarone load, IVFs, phenylephrine gtt.
   - rate control w digoxin
   - consider starting po amiodarone in am.
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - IVF boluses prn to maintain urine output, keep MAPs > 60.
   - Check TTE
   - f/u bl cxs
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - Telemetry
   - Unable to resite central line to RIJ for now as bedside U/S
   demonstrated thrombus in RIJ vein. If spikes fever and/or develops
   worsening hemodynamics, will need to try to place L SCV line or femoral
   lines if still on pressors. If off of pressors, can try to place PIVs.
   # h/o DVTs - Has known h/o bilateral LE DVTs and RUE DVT, s/p IVC
   filter [**2-24**]. On enoxaparin, which was last held on [**5-7**] when plts 20K.
   Possible that pt may have PE given recent afib with RVR, hypotension.
   - Check TTE to r/o RV strain.
   - Continue enoxaparin at 60 mg SQ [**Hospital1 **].
   - Per BMT, would hold enoxaparin if plts < 20K.
   .
   # Leukocytosis - WBC up to 11K from 5.6 on AM labs. Likely in setting
   of stress dose steroids, possibly secondary to stress reaction from AM
   events, or due to developing infection.
   - Monitor fever curve.
   - Follow-up bld cxs, UA
   .
   # Metabolic anion gap acidosis - AG 18, has been increasing over past
   few days. Likely secondary to lactic acidosis that may be secondary to
   hypoperfusion vs. increased cell death/turnover from recurrent
   lymphoma, although this has not yet been verified by biopsy.
   - Check venous lactate.
   - Closely monitor for worsening gap.
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia - Per BMT, because pt requires lovenox for
   treatment and prevention of further DVTs, the patient's platelet count
   should be kept greater than 50K.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse for > 50K.
   .
   #. Anemia - Likely related to anemia of chronic disease. Less likely
   that anemia is [**1-20**] chemo nadir at this point as last chemo was 1 month
   ago.
   - Follow Hct, transfuse for less than 24 per BMT.
   - Keep T&S active.
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   #. Nausea - Per BMT note, etiology unclear. Pt not currently
   complaining of this. Evaluated by GI and neurology on previous
   admission. GI recommended continuing with max dose reglan and an
   outpatient esophagael motility study.
   - reglan 2.5 mg PO tid with meals and prn
   - zyprexa 5 mg ODT TID prn
   - IV zofran prn
   .
   #. Back pain - Evaluated by pain service on last admission. Not
   currently complaining of back pain. Continue methadone.
   .
   #. GERD - Continue pantoprazole.
   .
   #. FEN - regular, low Ca, caffeine-free diet
   .
   #. PPX - acyclovir, fluconazole, pantoprazole; bowel regimen prn. On
   treatment doses of enoxaprin for known DVTs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who has undergone multiple doses of chemotherapy and is currently being transferred to a different hospital unit. The patient's condition is complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF/RVR), hypercalcemia, and upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 89 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 114/67 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis, as well as hypercalcemia and metabolic anion gap acidosis.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's AF/RVR is likely related to hypovolemia, malignant pericardial effusions, or infection. The patient's condition has been stabilized overnight with amiodarone, IV fluids, and phenylephrine.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is unclear in etiology, but may be related to AF/RVR, poor oral intake, or sepsis.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia is likely related to the patient's lymphoma.
4. Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis: The patient has a known history of bilateral lower extremity DVTs and right upper extremity DVT, and is currently on enoxaparin.
5. Metabolic anion gap acidosis: The patient's acidosis is likely related to lactic acidosis, which may be secondary to hypoperfusion or increased cell death/turnover from recurrent lymphoma.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely related to chemotherapy and may require transfusion.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely related to anemia of chronic disease.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Attempt to wean phenylephrine infusion.
2. Continue amiodarone for rate control.
3. Consider starting oral amiodarone in the morning.
4. Monitor urine output and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg.
5. Check for signs of sepsis, such as fever or worsening hemodynamics.
6. Monitor for worsening anion gap acidosis and consider checking venous lactate.
7. Continue enoxaparin for treatment and prevention of further DVTs.
8. Monitor platelet count and transfuse for less than 50,000.
9. Continue pantoprazole for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
10. Continue methadone for back pain.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to address his multiple medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a complex medical condition. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, and blood pressure of 114/67 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is currently in sinus rhythm. The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's renal function is normal, and the patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and anticoagulants. The patient's fluids are being managed carefully, with a total fluid input of 3,561 mL and a total fluid output of 2,811 mL over the past 24 hours.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes may indicate an underlying infection, which can progress to sepsis.
2. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulant therapy and history of atrial fibrillation may increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Renal failure: The patient's fluid management and potential underlying infection may increase the risk of renal failure.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen and potential underlying infection may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and underlying medical condition may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.

The patient's ICU care plan should include close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and fluid balance. The patient's medications should be carefully titrated to minimize the risk of complications."

   with afib with RVR in setting of hypotension.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation - Has been recurrent since initial diagnosis of
   DLBCL per wife and did require ICU admission during last hospital
   course for similar reasons (hypotension, afib with RVR). Also has prior
   h/o malignant pericardial tamponade. Has not been diuresed for several
   days on the floor; however, pt with poor po intake and intravascular
   hypovolemia may be contributing. Other considerations for recurrent
   afib are possibility of infection, recurrent lymphoma involvement of
   pericardium, inability to tolerate consistent dosing of beta-blockers
   on the floor due to hypotension over the weekend, or PE with RV
   overload --> increased RA filling pressures. Doubt hyperthyroid state.
   Now back in NSR s/p amiodarone load, IVFs, neo gtt.
   - Attempt to wean neo gtt. Pt and wife have declined further attempts
   at aline for now.
   - IVF boluses prn to maintain urine output, keep MAPs > 60.
   - Check TTE.
   - Blood cxs peripherally and from central line.
   - Empiric abx coverage with IV vancomycin, cefepime for now.
   - Unable to resite central line to RIJ for now as bedside U/S
   demonstrated thrombus in RIJ vein. If spikes fever and/or develops
   worsening hemodynamics, will need to try to place L SCV line or femoral
   lines if still on pressors. If off of pressors, can try to place PIVs.
   - Hold metoprolol for now given hypotension.
   - Telemetry.
   - Consider starting po amiodarone in am.
   .
   # Hypotension - In setting of afib with RVR, poor po intake, possible
   sepsis although no fevers.
   - Continue broad spectrum abxs as above, f/u cx data and narrow abxs as
   appropriate.
   - Wean off neo gtt as tolerated with IVF boluses as above.
   - TTE
   - No aline for now per pt and wife's wishes.
   .
   #. h/o DVTs - Has known h/o bilateral LE DVTs and RUE DVT, s/p IVC
   filter [**2-24**]. On enoxaparin, which was last held on [**5-7**] when plts 20K.
   Possible that pt may have PE given recent afib with RVR, hypotension.
   - Check TTE to r/o RV strain.
   - Continue enoxaparin at 60 mg SQ [**Hospital1 **].
   - Per BMT, would hold enoxaparin if plts < 20K.
   .
   #. Leukocytosis - WBC up to 11K from 5.6 on AM labs. Likely in setting
   of stress dose steroids, possibly secondary to stress reaction from AM
   events, or due to developing infection.
   - Monitor fever curve.
   - Follow-up bld cxs, UA
   .
   # Metabolic anion gap acidosis - AG 18, has been increasing over past
   few days. Likely secondary to lactic acidosis that may be secondary to
   hypoperfusion vs. increased cell death/turnover from recurrent
   lymphoma, although this has not yet been verified by biopsy.
   - Check venous lactate.
   - Closely monitor for worsening gap.
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia - Per BMT, because pt requires lovenox for
   treatment and prevention of further DVTs, the patient's platelet count
   should be kept greater than 50K.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse for > 50K.
   .
   #. Anemia - Likely related to anemia of chronic disease. Less likely
   that anemia is [**1-20**] chemo nadir at this point as last chemo was 1 month
   ago.
   - Follow Hct, transfuse for less than 24 per BMT.
   - Keep T&S active.
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   #. Nausea - Per BMT note, etiology unclear. Pt not currently
   complaining of this. Evaluated by GI and neurology on previous
   admission. GI recommended continuing with max dose reglan and an
   outpatient esophagael motility study.
   - reglan 2.5 mg PO tid with meals and prn
   - zyprexa 5 mg ODT TID prn
   - IV zofran prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) may lead to hemodynamic instability, hypotension, and decreased cardiac output.
	* The patient's history of malignant pericardial tamponade and recurrent AFib increases the risk of cardiac tamponade and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* The patient's history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and chemotherapy may increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
	* The patient's current oxygen therapy and respiratory support may not be sufficient to manage respiratory failure.
3. Hemodynamic Complications:
	* The patient's hypotension and decreased cardiac output may lead to organ dysfunction, including renal failure, hepatic failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
	* The patient's history of bilateral LE DVTs and RUE DVT increases the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
4. Infection Complications:
	* The patient's history of chemotherapy and immunosuppression increases the risk of infection, including sepsis and septic shock.
	* The patient's current antibiotic coverage may not be sufficient to manage potential infections.
5. Metabolic Complications:
	* The patient's metabolic anion gap acidosis may worsen and lead to multi-organ dysfunction, including respiratory and cardiac failure.
	* The patient's history of lactic acidosis may indicate underlying tissue hypoperfusion or cellular injury.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* The patient's history of nausea and vomiting may indicate gastrointestinal dysfunction, including gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
	* The patient's current medication regimen may not be sufficient to manage gastrointestinal symptoms.
7. Neurological Complications:
	* The patient's current delirium and confusion may indicate underlying neurological dysfunction, including cerebral edema or encephalopathy.
	* The patient's history of chemotherapy and immunosuppression increases the risk of neurological complications, including seizures and stroke.

The patient's complex medical history, current medications, and laboratory results suggest a high risk of potential complications. Close monitoring and management of the patient's condition are necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old male with diffuse large B cell lymphoma, s/p multiple doses
   of chemotherapy with hospital course complicated by afib with RVR,
   hypercalcemia, and upper extremity DVT who is being transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   with afib with RVR in setting of hypotension.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation - Has been recurrent since initial diagnosis of
   DLBCL per wife and did require ICU admission during last hospital
   course for similar reasons (hypotension, afib with RVR). Also has prior
   h/o malignant pericardial tamponade. Has not been diuresed for several
   days on the floor; however, pt with poor po intake and intravascular
   hypovolemia may be contributing. Other considerations for recurrent
   afib are possibility of infection, recurrent lymphoma involvement of
   pericardium, inability to tolerate consistent dosing of beta-blockers
   on the floor due to hypotension over the weekend, or PE with RV
   overload --> increased RA filling pressures. Doubt hyperthyroid state.
   Now back in NSR s/p amiodarone load, IVFs, neo gtt.
   - Attempt to wean neo gtt. Pt and wife have declined further attempts
   at aline for now.
   - IVF boluses prn to maintain urine output, keep MAPs > 60.
   - Check TTE.
   - Blood cxs peripherally and from central line.
   - Empiric abx coverage with IV vancomycin, cefepime for now.
   - Unable to resite central line to RIJ for now as bedside U/S
   demonstrated thrombus in RIJ vein. If spikes fever and/or develops
   worsening hemodynamics, will need to try to place L SCV line or femoral
   lines if still on pressors. If off of pressors, can try to place PIVs.
   - Hold metoprolol for now given hypotension.
   - Telemetry.
   - Consider starting po amiodarone in am.
   .
   # Hypotension - In setting of afib with RVR, poor po intake, possible
   sepsis although no fevers.
   - Continue broad spectrum abxs as above, f/u cx data and narrow abxs as
   appropriate.
   - Wean off neo gtt as tolerated with IVF boluses as above.
   - TTE
   - No aline for now per pt and wife's wishes.
   .
   #. h/o DVTs - Has known h/o bilateral LE DVTs and RUE DVT, s/p IVC
   filter [**2-24**]. On enoxaparin, which was last held on [**5-7**] when plts 20K.
   Possible that pt may have PE given recent afib with RVR, hypotension.
   - Check TTE to r/o RV strain.
   - Continue enoxaparin at 60 mg SQ [**Hospital1 **].
   - Per BMT, would hold enoxaparin if plts < 20K.
   .
   #. Leukocytosis - WBC up to 11K from 5.6 on AM labs. Likely in setting
   of stress dose steroids, possibly secondary to stress reaction from AM
   events, or due to developing infection.
   - Monitor fever curve.
   - Follow-up bld cxs, UA
   .
   # Metabolic anion gap acidosis - AG 18, has been increasing over past
   few days. Likely secondary to lactic acidosis that may be secondary to
   hypoperfusion vs. increased cell death/turnover from recurrent
   lymphoma, although this has not yet been verified by biopsy.
   - Check venous lactate.
   - Closely monitor for worsening gap.
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia - Per BMT, because pt requires lovenox for
   treatment and prevention of further DVTs, the patient's platelet count
   should be kept greater than 50K.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse for > 50K.
   .
   #. Anemia - Likely related to anemia of chronic disease. Less likely
   that anemia is [**1-20**] chemo nadir at this point as last chemo was 1 month
   ago.
   - Follow Hct, transfuse for less than 24 per BMT.
   - Keep T&S active.
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   #. Nausea - Per BMT note, etiology unclear. Pt not currently
   complaining of this. Evaluated by GI and neurology on previous
   admission. GI recommended continuing with max dose reglan and an
   outpatient esophagael motility study.
   - reglan 2.5 mg PO tid with meals and prn
   - zyprexa 5 mg ODT TID prn
   - IV zofran prn
   .
   #. Back pain - Evaluated by pain service on last admission. Not
   currently complaining of back pain. Continue methadone.
   .
   #. GERD - Continue pantoprazole.
   .
   #. FEN - regular, low Ca, caffeine-free diet
   .
   #. PPX - acyclovir, fluconazole, pantoprazole; bowel regimen prn. On
   treatment doses of enoxaprin for known DVTs
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with diffuse large B cell lymphoma, who has been admitted to the ICU due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR), hypotension, and upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient has a history of recurrent atrial fibrillation and has undergone multiple doses of chemotherapy.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (99°F)
* Heart rate: 89 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 114/67 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 11 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Central venous pressure (CVP): 7 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 11.0 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.2 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 105 x 10^9/L
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 17 mmol/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.7 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.09 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 6.4 mmol/L
* Electrolytes: Na+: 144 mmol/L, K+: 3.8 mmol/L, Ca2+: 8.5 mg/dL, Mg2+: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 3.0 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* Atrial fibrillation with RVR, which may be related to hypotension, infection, lymphoma involvement of the pericardium, or pulmonary embolism with right ventricular overload.
* Hypotension, which may be related to sepsis, anemia, or hypovolemia.
* Upper extremity DVT, which may be related to hypercoagulability or central line-related thrombosis.
* Leukocytosis, which may be related to stress dose steroids, stress reaction, or developing infection.
* Metabolic anion gap acidosis, which may be related to lactic acidosis secondary to hypoperfusion or increased cell death/turnover from recurrent lymphoma.
* Thrombocytopenia, which may be related to chemotherapy or heparin therapy.
* Anemia, which may be related to anemia of chronic disease or chemotherapy-related anemia.
* Nausea, which may be related to chemotherapy, infection, or gastrointestinal motility disorder.
* Back pain, which may be related to spinal cord compression or musculoskeletal strain.
* GERD, which may be related to medication use or gastrointestinal motility disorder.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Weaning off neo-glycemic control as tolerated with IV fluid boluses.
* Monitoring for worsening acidosis and adjusting therapy as necessary.
* Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics and narrowing antibiotic coverage as appropriate.
* Weaning off pressors as tolerated.
* Considering starting oral amiodarone in the morning.
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis and adjusting therapy as necessary.
* Continuing enoxaparin therapy at 60 mg SQ daily.
* Monitoring platelet count and transfusing for platelet counts less than 50K.
* Monitoring hemoglobin and transfusing for hemoglobin less than 24.
* Continuing guaiac stools and lactate monitoring.

Overall, the patient is at risk for various complications, including atrial fibrillation, hypotension, upper extremity DVT, leukocytosis, metabolic anion gap acidosis, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, back pain, and GERD. The patient's plan of care is focused on managing these complications and optimizing his clinical condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who has undergone multiple doses of chemotherapy and is currently being treated in the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF/RVR), hypercalcemia, and upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient is being transferred to Hospital Unit 44 with ongoing AF/RVR and hypotension.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.2°F)
* Heart rate: 114 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 102/50 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 9 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 93%

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Diminished right radial pulse
* Present left radial pulse
* Present right and left digital pulses
* Warm skin with no rashes
* Neurological examination reveals delirium with occasional incoherent statements

Laboratory results include:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 11.0 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.2 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 105 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.7 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.09 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 6.4 mmol/L
* LDH: 474 IU/L
* Calcium (Ca++): 8.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4): 2.4 mg/dL

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Hypotension: unclear etiology, likely in the setting of AF/RVR, poor PO intake, and possible sepsis.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: recurrent in the setting of hypovolemia vs malignant pericardial effusions vs infection.
3. Leukocytosis: WBC up to 11K from 5.6 on AM labs, likely in the setting of stress dose steroids, possibly secondary to stress reaction from AM events or developing infection.
4. Metabolic anion gap acidosis: AG 18, likely secondary to lactic acidosis that may be secondary to hypoperfusion vs increased cell death/turnover from recurrent lymphoma.
5. Thrombocytopenia: Per BMT, the patient's platelet count should be kept greater than 50K.

   61M w DLBCL s/p multiple doses of chemotherapy w hospital course c/b
   AF/RVR, hypercalcemia, and upper extremity DVT, who is being
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with afib with RVR in the setting of hypotension.
   # Hypotension: unclear etiology, likely in the setting of afib with
   RVR, poor po intake, possible sepsis although no fevers.
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - TTE
   - no aline for now per pt and wife's wishes.
   # Atrial fibrillation w RVR: recurrent in the setting of hypovolemia vs
   malignant pericardial effusions vs infection. Converted overnight to
   NSR s/p amiodarone load, IVFs, phenylephrine gtt.
   - rate control w digoxin
   - consider starting po amiodarone in am.
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - IVF boluses prn to maintain urine output, keep MAPs > 60.
   - Check TTE
   - f/u bl cxs
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - Telemetry
   - Unable to resite central line to RIJ for now as bedside U/S
   demonstrated thrombus in RIJ vein. If spikes fever and/or develops
   worsening hemodynamics, will need to try to place L SCV line or femoral
   lines if still on pressors. If off of pressors, can try to place PIVs.
   # h/o DVTs - Has known h/o bilateral LE DVTs and RUE DVT, s/p IVC
   filter [**2-24**]. On enoxaparin, which was last held on [**5-7**] when plts 20K.
   Possible that pt may have PE given recent afib with RVR, hypotension.
   - Check TTE to r/o RV strain.
   - Continue enoxaparin at 60 mg SQ [**Hospital1 **].
   - Per BMT, would hold enoxaparin if plts < 20K.
   .
   # Leukocytosis - WBC up to 11K from 5.6 on AM labs. Likely in setting
   of stress dose steroids, possibly secondary to stress reaction from AM
   events, or due to developing infection.
   - Monitor fever curve.
   - Follow-up bld cxs, UA
   .
   # Metabolic anion gap acidosis - AG 18, has been increasing over past
   few days. Likely secondary to lactic acidosis that may be secondary to
   hypoperfusion vs. increased cell death/turnover from recurrent
   lymphoma, although this has not yet been verified by biopsy.
   - Check venous lactate.
   - Closely monitor for worsening gap.
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia - Per BMT, because pt requires lovenox for
   treatment and prevention of further DVTs, the patient's platelet count
   should be kept greater than 50K.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse for > 50K.
   .
   #. Anemia - Likely related to anemia of chronic disease. Less likely
   that anemia is [**1-20**] chemo nadir at this point as last chemo was 1 month
   ago.
   - Follow Hct, transfuse for less than 24 per BMT.
   - Keep T&S active.
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   #. Nausea - Per BMT note, etiology unclear. Pt not currently
   complaining of this. Evaluated by GI and neurology on previous
   admission. GI recommended continuing with max dose reglan and an
   outpatient esophagael motility study.
   - reglan 2.5 mg PO tid with meals and prn
   - zyprexa 5 mg ODT TID prn
   - IV zofran prn
   .
   #. Back pain - Evaluated by pain service on last admission. Not
   currently complaining of back pain. Continue methadone.
   .
   #. GERD - Continue pantoprazole.
   .
   #. FEN - regular, low Ca, caffeine-free diet
   .
   #. PPX - acyclovir, fluconazole, pantoprazole; bowel regimen prn. On
   treatment doses of enoxaprin for known DVTs
   .
   # ACCESS - Left IJ TLC placed by IR on [**2127-4-23**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   61M w DLBCL s/p multiple doses of chemotherapy w hospital course c/b
   AF/RVR, hypercalcemia, and upper extremity DVT, who is being
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with afib with RVR in the setting of hypotension.
   # Hypotension: unclear etiology, likely in the setting of afib with
   RVR, poor po intake, possible sepsis although no fevers.
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - TTE
   - no aline for now per pt and wife's wishes.
   # Atrial fibrillation w RVR: recurrent in the setting of hypovolemia vs
   malignant pericardial effusions vs infection. Converted overnight to
   NSR s/p amiodarone load, IVFs, phenylephrine gtt.
   - rate control w digoxin
   - consider starting po amiodarone in am.
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - IVF boluses prn to maintain urine output, keep MAPs > 60.
   - Check TTE
   - f/u bl cxs
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - Telemetry
   - Unable to resite central line to RIJ for now as bedside U/S
   demonstrated thrombus in RIJ vein. If spikes fever and/or develops
   worsening hemodynamics, will need to try to place L SCV line or femoral
   lines if still on pressors. If off of pressors, can try to place PIVs.
   # h/o DVTs - Has known h/o bilateral LE DVTs and RUE DVT, s/p IVC
   filter [**2-24**]. On enoxaparin, which was last held on [**5-7**] when plts 20K.
   Possible that pt may have PE given recent afib with RVR, hypotension.
   - Check TTE to r/o RV strain.
   - Continue enoxaparin at 60 mg SQ [**Hospital1 **].
   - Per BMT, would hold enoxaparin if plts < 20K.
   .
   # Leukocytosis - WBC up to 11K from 5.6 on AM labs. Likely in setting
   of stress dose steroids, possibly secondary to stress reaction from AM
   events, or due to developing infection.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   61M w DLBCL s/p multiple doses of chemotherapy w hospital course c/b
   AF/RVR, hypercalcemia, and upper extremity DVT, who is being
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with afib with RVR in the setting of hypotension.
   # Hypotension: unclear etiology, likely in the setting of afib with
   RVR, poor po intake, possible sepsis although no fevers.
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - TTE
   - no aline for now per pt and wife's wishes.
   # Atrial fibrillation w RVR: recurrent in the setting of hypovolemia vs
   malignant pericardial effusions vs infection. Converted overnight to
   NSR s/p amiodarone load, IVFs, phenylephrine gtt.
   - rate control w digoxin
   - consider starting po amiodarone in am.
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - IVF boluses prn to maintain urine output, keep MAPs > 60.
   - Check TTE
   - f/u bl cxs
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - Telemetry
   - Unable to resite central line to RIJ for now as bedside U/S
   demonstrated thrombus in RIJ vein. If spikes fever and/or develops
   worsening hemodynamics, will need to try to place L SCV line or femoral
   lines if still on pressors. If off of pressors, can try to place PIVs.
   # h/o DVTs - Has known h/o bilateral LE DVTs and RUE DVT, s/p IVC
   filter [**2-24**]. On enoxaparin, which was last held on [**5-7**] when plts 20K.
   Possible that pt may have PE given recent afib with RVR, hypotension.
   - Check TTE to r/o RV strain.
   - Continue enoxaparin at 60 mg SQ [**Hospital1 **].
   - Per BMT, would hold enoxaparin if plts < 20K.
   .
   # Leukocytosis - WBC up to 11K from 5.6 on AM labs. Likely in setting
   of stress dose steroids, possibly secondary to stress reaction from AM
   events, or due to developing infection.
   - Monitor fever curve.
   - Follow-up bld cxs, UA
   .
   # Metabolic anion gap acidosis - AG 16, has been increasing over past
   few days. Likely secondary to lactic acidosis that may be secondary to
   hypoperfusion vs. increased cell death/turnover from recurrent
   lymphoma, although this has not yet been verified by biopsy.
   - Check venous lactate.
   - Closely monitor for worsening gap.
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia - Per BMT, because pt requires lovenox for
   treatment and prevention of further DVTs, the patient's platelet count
   should be kept greater than 50K.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse for > 50K.
   .
   #. Anemia - Likely related to anemia of chronic disease. Less likely
   that anemia is [**1-20**] chemo nadir at this point as last chemo was 1 month
   ago.
   - Follow Hct, transfuse for less than 24 per BMT.

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who has undergone multiple doses of chemotherapy and is currently being treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF/RVR), hypercalcemia, and upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's condition is complex and involves several potential medical complications. The following are some of the key issues:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 102/50 mmHg, which is considered hypotensive. The etiology of the hypotension is unclear, but it may be related to the patient's AF/RVR, poor oral intake, or possible sepsis.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's AF/RVR is recurrent and may be related to hypovolemia, malignant pericardial effusions, or infection. The patient has been converted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) overnight, but the underlying cause of the AF/RVR needs to be addressed.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium level is 17 mg/dL, which is elevated. This may be related to the patient's underlying lymphoma or other medical conditions.
4. Upper extremity DVT: The patient has a known history of bilateral lower extremity DVTs and right upper extremity DVT, and has been placed on enoxaparin for prophylaxis. The patient may have a pulmonary embolism (PE) given the recent AF/RVR and hypotension.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is up to 11K, which is elevated. This may be related to stress dose steroids, a stress reaction from recent events, or a developing infection.
6. Metabolic anion gap acidosis: The patient's anion gap is 16, which is elevated. This may be related to lactic acidosis, which may be secondary to hypoperfusion or increased cell death/turnover from recurrent lymphoma.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 105 K/uL, which is low. This may be related to the patient's underlying lymphoma or other medical conditions.
8. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.2 g/dL, which is low. This may be related to anemia of chronic disease or other medical conditions.
9. Nausea: The patient's nausea is not currently being complained of, but has been evaluated by GI and neurology in the past. The etiology of the nausea is unclear.
10. Back pain: The patient's back pain is not currently being complained of, but was evaluated by the pain service on a previous admission. The etiology of the back pain is unclear.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Rate control with digoxin for AF/RVR
2. Consideration of starting po amiodarone in the morning
3. Attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
4. IVF boluses prn to maintain urine output and keep mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60
5. Check TTE to rule out RV strain
6. Continue enoxaparin at 60 mg SQ for known DVTs
7. Monitor fever curve and follow-up blood cultures
8. Closely monitor for worsening metabolic anion gap acidosis
9. Follow platelet count and transfuse for > 50K
10. Follow hemoglobin level and transfuse for < 24 per BMT
11. Keep T&S active
12. Guaiac stools
13. Continue reglan 2.5 mg PO tid with meals and prn
14. Continue zyprexa 5 mg ODT TID prn
15. Continue IV zofran prn
16. Continue methadone
17. Continue pantoprazole
18. Continue acyclovir, fluconazole, and pantoprazole
19. Continue enoxaparin for known DVTs

The patient's code status is full code, and his DNR/DNI status is confirmed with his wife."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   61M w DLBCL s/p multiple doses of chemotherapy w hospital course c/b
   AF/RVR, hypercalcemia, and RUE DVT, who is being transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   with afib with RVR in the setting of hypotension.
   # Atrial fibrillation w RVR: unclear etiology, possibly in the setting
   of hypovolemia vs malignant pericardial effusions vs infection/sepsis.
   Responded to amiodarone in the past.
   - rate control w digoxin at baseline
   - if unstable, consider phenylephrine bolus vs amiodarone 150mg IV vs
   metoprolol IV if BP tolerates
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - IVF boluses prn to maintain urine output, keep MAPs > 60.
   - f/u bl cxs
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - telemetry
   # Hypotension: unclear etiology, likely combination of poor po intake w
   possible sepsis [**1-20**] infxn (?line infxn), worsened by afib w RVR.
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - no a-line for now per pt and wife's wishes.
   # Agitation: intermittently delirious
   - haldol PRN
   # h/o DVTs - Has known h/o bilateral LE DVTs and RUE DVT, s/p IVC
   filter [**2-24**]. On enoxaparin, which was last held on [**5-7**] when plts 20K.
   Possible that pt may have PE given recent afib with RVR, hypotension.
   - Continue enoxaparin at 60 mg SQ [**Hospital1 **].
   - Per BMT, would hold enoxaparin if plts < 20K.
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 [**1-20**] Infxn vs steroids.
   - Monitor fever curve.
   - Follow-up bld cxs, UA
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per BMT, because pt requires lovenox for treatment
   and prevention of further DVTs, the patient's platelet count should be
   kept greater than 50K.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse for > 50K.
   .
   # Anemia - Likely related to anemia of chronic disease. Less likely
   that anemia is [**1-20**] chemo nadir at this point as last chemo was 1 month
   ago.
   - Follow Hct, transfuse for less than 24 per BMT.
   - Keep T&S active.
   - Guaiac stools.
   # Metabolic anion gap acidosis - Has been increasing over past few
   days. Likely secondary to lactic acidosis that may be secondary to
   hypoperfusion vs. increased cell death/turnover from recurrent
   lymphoma, although this has not yet been verified by biopsy.
   - Check venous lactate.
   - Closely monitor for worsening gap.
   .
   # Nausea - Per BMT note, etiology unclear. Pt not currently complaining
   of this. Evaluated by GI and neurology on previous admission. GI
   recommended continuing with max dose reglan and an outpatient
   esophagael motility study.
   - reglan 2.5 mg PO tid with meals and prn
   - zyprexa 5 mg ODT TID prn
   - IV zofran prn
   .
   # Back pain - Evaluated by pain service on last admission. Not
   currently complaining of back pain. Continue methadone.
   .
   # GERD - Continue pantoprazole.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who has been admitted to the ICU with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF/RVR), hypotension, and hypercalcemia. He has a history of multiple doses of chemotherapy and has been transferred to the ICU with AF/RVR in the setting of hypotension. The patient's condition is unstable, and he requires close monitoring and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's AF/RVR is likely to be caused by hypovolemia, malignant pericardial effusions, or infection/sepsis. The patient's condition is unstable, and he requires rate control with digoxin, phenylephrine, or amiodarone.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely caused by poor PO intake, possible sepsis, and worsened by AF/RVR. The patient requires IVF boluses to maintain urine output and keep MAPs > 60.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be caused by infection or steroids. The patient requires monitoring of his fever curve and follow-up blood cultures.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be caused by chemotherapy or sepsis. The patient requires close monitoring of his platelet count and transfusion for a count < 50K.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be caused by anemia of chronic disease or chemotherapy. The patient requires close monitoring of his Hct and transfusion for a count < 24.
6. Metabolic anion gap acidosis: The patient's acidosis may be caused by lactic acidosis secondary to hypoperfusion or increased cell death/turnover from recurrent lymphoma. The patient requires close monitoring of his venous lactate and acidosis.
7. Nausea: The patient's nausea may be caused by chemotherapy or sepsis. The patient requires close monitoring of his nausea and vomiting and treatment with antiemetics as needed.
8. Back pain: The patient's back pain may be caused by lymphoma or sepsis. The patient requires close monitoring of his back pain and treatment with pain medications as needed.
9. GERD: The patient's GERD may be caused by lymphoma or sepsis. The patient requires close monitoring of his GERD and treatment with antacids as needed.

ICU Care:

The patient requires close monitoring and treatment in the ICU. He requires:

1. Close monitoring of his vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.
2. Monitoring of his blood glucose levels and treatment with insulin as needed.
3. Monitoring of his electrolyte levels and treatment with electrolyte replacement as needed.
4. Monitoring of his platelet count and transfusion for a count < 50K.
5. Monitoring of his Hct and transfusion for a count < 24.
6. Monitoring of his venous lactate and acidosis.
7. Treatment with antiemetics as needed for nausea and vomiting.
8. Treatment with pain medications as needed for back pain.
9. Treatment with antacids as needed for GERD.

The patient's family should be informed of his condition and treatment plan, and they should be involved in his care as much as possible. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he requires close monitoring and treatment in the ICU."
