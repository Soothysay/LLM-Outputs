You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 15 cmH2O.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has a creatinine level of 4.3 mg/dL, and the urine output is greatly diminished.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a heart rate of 120s and a blood pressure of 80s.
4. Fever: The patient has a temperature of 103.5°F, and the source of the fever is unknown.
5. Chest pain: The patient is experiencing chest pain, which is likely related to the acute respiratory failure.
6. Hyoxemia: The patient has a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 36 mmHg, indicating hypoxemia.

The patient's laboratory results include:

1. Complete blood count (CBC): The patient has a white blood cell count of 2.4 K/uL and a platelet count of 84 K/uL.
2. Electrolytes: The patient has a sodium level of 137 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, and chloride level of 109 mEq/L.
3. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): The patient has a BUN level of 56 mg/dL.
4. Creatinine: The patient has a creatinine level of 4.3 mg/dL.
5. Troponin-T: The patient has a troponin-T level of 0.06 ng/mL.

The patient's medications include:

1. Fentanyl: 200 mcg/hour
2. Midazolam (Versed): 5.5 mg/hour
3. Phenylephrine: 1.2 mcg/Kg/min
4. Lopressor: 5mg IV x 1
5. Esmolol: started as a drip
6. Levofloxacin: started for atypical pneumonia
7. Lansoprazole (Prevacid): started for stress ulcer prophylaxis

The patient's plan includes:

1. Continuing mechanical ventilation and FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 15 cmH2O.
2. Maintaining the arterial line and multi-lumen line.
3. Monitoring the patient's renal function and urine output.
4. Managing the patient's atrial fibrillation with medications.
5. Investigating the source of the patient's fever.
6. Providing stress ulcer prophylaxis with lansoprazole.
7. Monitoring the patient's electrolyte levels and adjusting medications as necessary.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and hypotension may indicate sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress to ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury and potentially requiring dialysis.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and potentially cardiac arrest.
5. Infection: The patient's fever and hypotension may indicate an infection, which can lead to sepsis and potentially multi-organ failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   Resp failure: Likely CAP with disease involving entire R lung.
   Currently with [**Doctor Last Name 2**] based on gas.
   - continue Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - decrease vent settings
   - sputum cx
   - Bronch today
   Hypotension:  Will need a-line and CVL today.
   - Bolusing now as low UOP
   - Check CVPs when CVL placed
   - goal MAP>60, CVP>8
   A-fib with RVR/History of CAD: Biomarkers negative this AM.  Chest pain
   and ECG changes resolved with rate control.
   - Holding BB until hypotension resolved
   - Would favor esmolol gtt for quick on/off if he develops RVR again.
   ARF: Likely pre-renal given low UOP, but may be intrinsic renal (ATN)
   or AIN related.
   - fluid bolus now
   - send urine lytes
   - Renal U/S
   - Renal consult
   Chronic DVTs: on coumadin
   - Hold coumadin now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 70-inch tall individual with a weight of unknown value, admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic DVTs and is currently on coumadin. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, with a recent increase in propofol for lines, which has led to improved hemodynamic stability. The patient has also been experiencing respiratory failure, with a diagnosis of likely CAP with disease involving the entire right lung.

The patient has undergone various diagnostic tests, including ultrasound, bronchoscopy, and blood cultures, with results pending. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased creatinine levels.

The patient is currently receiving various medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and sedatives. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 82/45 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's diagnosis of likely CAP with disease involving the entire right lung increases the risk of respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory rate is currently 25 breaths per minute, which may indicate worsening respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension may indicate sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's increased creatinine levels and decreased urine output may indicate AKI, which can lead to further complications.
4. Chronic DVTs: The patient's history of chronic DVTs increases the risk of recurrent DVTs, which can lead to pulmonary embolism.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's diagnosis of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke and other cardiovascular complications.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may indicate inadequate perfusion of vital organs, which can lead to organ dysfunction.
7. Infection: The patient's fever and tachycardia may indicate infection, which can lead to further complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and vasopressors as ordered.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilation settings as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and adjust vasopressor dosing as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust fluid management accordingly.
5. Consider consulting a nephrologist for further management of the patient's AKI.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulation status and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
7. Consider consulting a cardiologist for further management of the patient's atrial fibrillation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   84M with h/o COPD, CAD, PE, recently transferred out of the MICU with
   presumed CAP, now transferred back to the MICU for persistent fevers,
   tachypnea, and hypotension.
   .
   # fever/hypotension - most concerning for brewing septic picture.  CXR
   now with PNA involving entire R lung, concerning for ARDS.  Lactate
   remains normal, but with metabolic acidosis and minimal urine output.
   Hypotensive overnight requiring pressors.  A-line/CVL placed
   - Continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **].
   - Maintain MAP>55, CVP>12
   - F/u  UCx, Sputum Cx, BCx.
   - Wean pressors as tolerated.
   .
   # Resp failure: Likely CAP with disease involving entire R lung.
   Currently with [**Doctor Last Name 2**] based on gas.
   - continue Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - decrease vent settings as tolerated
   - f/u sputum cx
   - Bronch today
   .
   # Metabolic non-gap acidosis: Patient with pH of 7.30 this am, nl PCO2.
   Consider [**1-13**] to renal failure.
   - Increase respiratory rate to compensate
   .
   # ARF: Renal consulted and suggests ARF related to multiple myeloma as
   urine sediment not consistent with intrinsic renal (ATN). Also consider
   AIN related.  Renal U/S without hydronephrosis.  Rapidly worsening
   overnight with minimal UOP
   - F/u Renal recs
   .
   # pancytopenia - at her baseline currently, WBC trended up slightly
   2.3->3.1.
   - trend CBC.
   .
   # chest pain - h/o CAD s/p left LAD stent. ECG with some dynamic t-wave
   changes, ruled out prior to being called out of MICU, now s/p 2nd
   episode of chest pain which per notes responded to SL NTG.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol, lipitor.
   - cycle CE x 2 sets.
   - repeat ECG in AM.
   - goal HCT > 30 if evidence of ischemia.
   .
   # atrial fibrillation - currently in afib, on coumadin, though CHADs=1.
   s/p PPM for sick sinus syndrome.  metoprolol dose increased to 25mg po
   tid on [**5-24**].
   - hold metoprolol for now given ?hypotension, if [**Last Name (LF) 991**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] treat with
   IVF prn UOP>30cc/hr, and consider cautiously reintroducing metoprolol
   12.5mg prn for goal HR 60s.
   - hold coumadin, goal INR >2.0.
   .
   # h/o PE - remote per pt, on coumadin, though this could be for afib.
   negative v/q upon admission.
   - hold coumadin pending possible bronch in AM.
   .
   # anemia - baseline hct ~24, attributed to myeloma and CLL.  no
   evidence of significant ischemia on ECG presently, so will hold off on
   further transfusion.  HCT currently 26.
   - transfuse for HCT > 30 if evidence of ischemia, otherwise >21.
   - trend HCT.
   - continue folate, iron, b12 repletion.
   .
   # multipe myeloma - long standing, failed alkeran/prednisone, started
   on velcade on [**2116-5-14**], followed at [**Company 1794**].
   - hold velcade for now.
   .
   # CLL - baseline WBC 2.0-2.3 over last year. currently at baseline.
   .
   # FEN: npo p mn for bronch, No IVF, cardiac diet
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, ppi (at home dose).
   .
   # Communication: Patient, son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] (HCP), [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6669**]
   A-fib with RVR/History of CAD: Biomarkers negative.  Chest pain and ECG
   changes resolved with rate control.
   - Holding BB until hypotension resolved
   - Would favor esmolol gtt for quick on/off if he develops RVR again.
   Chronic DVTs: on coumadin
   - Hold coumadin now

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, PE, and recently transferred out of the MICU with presumed CAP. He is currently in the ICU for persistent fevers, tachypnea, and hypotension.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 103.5°F (39.7°C)
* Heart rate: 85-125 bpm
* Blood pressure: 82/45 mmHg (58/45 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 25 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient has undergone various interventions, including:

* Arterial line placement
* Bronchoscopy
* Renal ultrasound
* Multilumen catheter placement
* Tube feeds initiation
* Antibiotic administration (Vanc, levofloxacin)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 2.4 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 84 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.4-4.3 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.8 mmol/L
* Metabolic acidosis with pH 7.30
* Troponin-T: 0.06 ng/mL
* TCO2: 25-22 mmHg

The patient's diagnosis is likely CAP with disease involving the entire right lung, which is concerning for ARDS. The patient is also at risk for septic shock, given the persistent fever, tachypnea, and hypotension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's persistent fever, tachypnea, and hypotension suggest a high risk of septic shock.
2. ARDS: The patient's lung disease and respiratory failure may progress to ARDS, which can be life-threatening.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, and the patient is at risk for renal failure.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen, leading to further complications.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD, atrial fibrillation, and recent chest pain may lead to cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
6. Pancytopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count and platelet count may lead to bleeding or infection.
7. Multilumen catheter-related complications: The patient's multilumen catheter may be associated with complications, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing antibiotics and pressors as needed
* Monitoring for signs of septic shock and ARDS
* Adjusting ventilation settings as tolerated
* Trending CBC and platelet count
* Holding metoprolol and coumadin until further evaluation
* Reassessing the patient's cardiac status and considering further interventions as needed."

   # ARF: Renal consulted and suggests ARF related to multiple myeloma as
   urine sediment not consistent with intrinsic renal (ATN). Also consider
   AIN related.  Renal U/S without hydronephrosis.  Rapidly worsening
   overnight with minimal UOP
   - F/u Renal recs
   .
   # pancytopenia - at her baseline currently, WBC trended up slightly
   2.3->3.1.
   - trend CBC.
   .
   # chest pain - h/o CAD s/p left LAD stent. ECG with some dynamic t-wave
   changes, ruled out earlier in hospitalization.  Chest pain appeared to
   resolve with rate control.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient, an 84-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, PE, and recently transferred from the MICU, was admitted to the ICU with persistent fevers, tachypnea, and hypotension. The patient has a presumed diagnosis of CAP, but the CXR now shows PNA involving the entire right lung, concerning for ARDS. The patient has metabolic acidosis and minimal urine output, requiring pressors to maintain blood pressure.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Septic picture: The patient's fever, tachypnea, and hypotension suggest a brewing septic picture, which is a major concern.
2. ARDS: The CXR shows PNA involving the entire right lung, which is concerning for ARDS.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a pH of 7.30, which is indicative of metabolic acidosis.
4. ARF: The patient has rapidly worsening renal function, which is concerning for acute renal failure.
5. Pancytopenia: The patient has a low white blood cell count, which is a concern.
6. Chest pain: The patient has a history of CAD and has had chest pain, which has been attributed to ischemia.
7. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is being managed with medication.
8. Multipe myeloma: The patient has a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, which is being managed with chemotherapy.

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 2.4 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 84 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.4 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.06 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 0.8 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.1 g/dL
* Calcium: 5.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.6 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Vanc (vancomycin)
* Fentanyl
* Midazolam (Versed)
* Phenylephrine
* Metoprolol
* Dextrose 50%
* Lansoprazole (Prevacid)
* Coumadin
* Aspirin
* Lipitor
* Velcade

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue vancomycin
* Maintain MAP > 55 and CVP > 12
* Wean pressors as tolerated
* F/u UCx, Sputum Cx, BCx
* Bronch today
* Decrease vent settings as tolerated
* F/u sputum cx
* Consider renal replacement therapy if renal function continues to deteriorate

The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU."

   bilaterally, as
   questioned.
   Assessment and Plan
   84M with h/o COPD, CAD, PE, recently transferred out of the MICU with
   presumed CAP, now transferred back to the MICU for persistent fevers,
   tachypnea, and hypotension.
   .
   # fever/hypotension - most concerning for brewing septic picture.  CXR
   now with PNA involving entire R lung, concerning for ARDS.  Lactate
   remains normal, but with metabolic acidosis and minimal urine output.
   Hypotensive overnight requiring pressors.  A-line/CVL placed
   - Continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **].
   - Maintain MAP>55, CVP>12
   - F/u  UCx, Sputum Cx, BCx.
   - Wean pressors as tolerated.
   .
   # Resp failure: Likely CAP with disease involving entire R lung.
   Currently with [**Doctor Last Name 2**] based on gas.
   - continue Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - decrease vent settings as tolerated
   - f/u sputum cx
   - Bronch today
   .
   # Metabolic non-gap acidosis: Patient with pH of 7.30 this am, nl PCO2.
   Consider [**1-13**] to renal failure.
   - Increase respiratory rate to compensate
   .
   # ARF: Renal consulted and suggests ARF related to multiple myeloma as
   urine sediment not consistent with intrinsic renal (ATN). Also consider
   AIN related.  Renal U/S without hydronephrosis.  Rapidly worsening
   overnight with minimal UOP
   - F/u Renal recs
   .
   # pancytopenia - at her baseline currently, WBC trended up slightly
   2.3->3.1.
   - trend CBC.
   .
   # chest pain - h/o CAD s/p left LAD stent. ECG with some dynamic t-wave
   changes, ruled out earlier in hospitalization.  Chest pain appeared to
   resolve with rate control.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol, lipitor.
   - cycle CE x 2 sets.
   - goal HCT > 30 if evidence of ischemia.
   .
   # atrial fibrillation - currently in afib, on coumadin for h/o PE,
   though CHADs=1. s/p PPM for sick sinus syndrome.  metoprolol dose
   increased to 25mg po tid on [**5-24**].
   - hold metoprolol for now given ?hypotension, if [**Last Name (LF) 991**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] cautiously
   reintroduce metoprolol for goal HR 60s.
   - hold coumadin, goal INR >2.0.
   .
   # h/o PE - remote per pt, on coumadin, though this could be for afib.
   negative v/q upon admission.
   - hold coumadin with supratherapeutic INR.
   .
   # anemia - baseline hct ~24, attributed to myeloma and CLL.  no
   evidence of significant ischemia on ECG presently, so will hold off on
   further transfusion.  HCT currently 26.
   - transfuse for HCT > 30 if evidence of ischemia, otherwise >21.
   - trend HCT.
   - continue folate, iron, b12 repletion.
   .
   # multipe myeloma - long standing, failed alkeran/prednisone, started
   on velcade on [**2116-5-14**], followed at [**Company 1794**].
   - hold velcade for now.
   .
   # CLL - baseline WBC 2.0-2.3 over last year. currently at baseline.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, PE, and recently transferred from the MICU with presumed CAP, now transferred back to the MICU for persistent fevers, tachypnea, and hypotension. The patient has a severe septic picture with a brewing septicemia, ARDS, and metabolic acidosis. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with FiO2 60% and PEEP 15 cmH2O. The patient has a rapidly worsening renal failure, with a creatinine level of 3.4 mg/dL and a urine output of 290 mL. The patient also has a pancytopenia, atrial fibrillation, and a history of PE.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's severe septicemia and metabolic acidosis increase the risk of septic shock, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS can worsen his respiratory failure and increase the risk of mortality.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's rapidly worsening renal failure can lead to acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, or even end-stage renal disease.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia can increase the risk of bleeding, infection, and death.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and death.
6. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's history of PE and the presence of DVT prophylaxis boots increase the risk of recurrent PE.
7. Multifocal Myeloma: The patient's multifocal myeloma can worsen his renal failure, anemia, and pancytopenia.
8. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL): The patient's CLL can worsen his pancytopenia and increase the risk of infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue vancillin and adjust the dosage as necessary to achieve therapeutic levels.
2. Maintain MAP>55 and CVP>12 to prevent hypotension and cardiac compromise.
3. Wean pressors as tolerated to prevent hypertension and cardiac compromise.
4. Continue bronchodilators to manage bronchospasm and respiratory failure.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust his fluid management and diuretic therapy accordingly.
6. Consider transfusing the patient with blood products to correct his pancytopenia and anemia.
7. Continue anticoagulation therapy to prevent recurrent PE.
8. Consider chemotherapy for the patient's multifocal myeloma and CLL.
9. Monitor the patient's cardiac function closely and adjust his medication regimen accordingly.
10. Consider consulting a specialist in hematology and oncology to develop a comprehensive treatment plan for the patient's multifocal myeloma and CLL."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - Vanc level therapeutic
   - OG tube ok to use
   - Metoprolol discontinued given low-running BP
   - RIJ and left a-line placed
   - Bronched
   - Urine lytes c/w prerenal FEUrea 23; urine smear neg for eos. Given 1L
   bolus x 2 with improvement in U/O.
   - Renal c/s: Likely CRF [**1-13**] mult myeloma. Check urine:protein; renal
   U/S. Urine not c/w ATN. ?AIN to abx but unlikely.
   - Renal U/S: no hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.
   - Noted to have right pupil slightly larger than left pupil; both
   constricting but ?more sluggish in right. Limited neuro exam nonfocal.
   B/l tremors thought to be [**1-13**] fever.
   - SBP decreased in setting of increased propofol for lines. Became more
   tachy with HR 120s and SBP 80s -> given lopressor 5mg IV x 1 with
   improvement in both HR and SBP. Increased tachycardia to 140s in
   setting of fever -> started esmolol gtt -> weaned off in setting of
   increased sedation.
   - TSH 1.1
   - Pt overbreathing vent so sedation changed from propofol to
   fent/midaz. Skin mottled-appearing. ABG 7.2/52/80. Sedation increased
   with repeat ABG 7.23/50/80. CXR still w/ diffuse R lung opacities.
   Started levofloxacin for atyicals and double coverage of GNR. Sedation
   further increased, RR increased 20->25, PEEP increased 8->15, and FiO2
   increased 50->60% with repeat ABG 7.32/39/142
   - Greatly diminished UO with rising Cr but lactate 0.8 and CvO2 74%.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, an 84-year-old male, was admitted to the ICU with presumed CAP, recently transferred back from the MICU due to persistent fevers, tachypnea, and hypotension. He has a history of COPD, CAD, and PE. The patient has a positive influenza A test and CXR showing infiltrates involving the entire right lung, suggestive of ARDS. He is currently in septic shock with multi-organ failure, requiring pressors and vasopressin. His lactate levels are normal, but he has metabolic acidosis and anuria.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Empyema: The patient's continued febrile state and shock suggest the possibility of empyema, which is a concern given his respiratory failure and ARDS.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's anuria and rapidly worsening renal function suggest the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
3. Metabolic Non-Gap Acidosis: The patient's worsening acidosis may lead to end-organ damage and further compromise his already compromised renal function.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's AFib may worsen his hemodynamic instability and increase his risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Leukopenia: The patient's immunocompromised state and neutropenic precautions may increase his risk of infection.
6. ARF: The patient's anuria and rapidly worsening renal function suggest the possibility of acute renal failure (ARF), which may be related to his multiple myeloma or AIN.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS and respiratory failure may worsen his oxygenation and ventilation requirements, increasing his risk of respiratory complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/oseltamivir for treatment of influenza A.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider decreasing PEEP as tolerated.
3. Consider thoracentesis if the patient's respiratory status worsens or if empyema is suspected.
4. Continue neutropenic precautions and monitor the patient's white blood cell count.
5. Consider renal replacement therapy if the patient's renal function continues to deteriorate.
6. Monitor the patient's metabolic acidosis and consider adjusting his fluid management and electrolyte levels accordingly.
7. Continue vasopressin and neo to maintain MAP >55 and CVP >12.
8. Consider transferring the patient to a cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CTICU) if his cardiac status worsens or if he requires further cardiac interventions."

   # Septic Shock with multi-organ failure: Influenza A positive with CXR
   showing infiltrates involving entire R lung with P:F ratio 163
   suggestive of ARDS. Lactate remains normal, but with metabolic acidosis
   and anuria. Hypotensive requiring pressors.
   - Concerned for empyema as continues to be febrile and continues to
   have shock but [**Female First Name (un) 231**] not consistent with goals of care
   - Continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]

   # Resp failure: Influenza A with disease involving entire R lung and as
   above concern for empyema.  Currently with ARDS based on P:F ratio.
   - Continue Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - Decrease PEEP as tolerated; maintain Tv at goal 6 ml/kg
   - F/u sputum cx and bronch cultures
   - Try lying on left side to aerate diseased lung better
   - Thoracentesis not consistent with goals of care

   - PCP and oncologist updated and confirm worsening multiple myeloma
   # Metabolic non-gap acidosis: Worsening acidosis; likely [**1-13**] to renal
   failure.
   # ARF: Likely related to multiple myeloma as urine sediment not
   consistent with intrinsic renal (ATN). Also consider AIN related.
   Renal U/S without hydronephrosis.  Rapidly worsening overnight with
   minimal UOP
   - F/u Renal recs
   - Unable to transition off neo despite vasopressin
   - CVVH not c/w goals of care
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in afib, on coumadin at home for h/o
   PE, though CHADs=1. S/p PPM for sick sinus syndrome which is
   functioning but not capturing while in Afib per EP.
   - Appreciate EP recs
   - Holding metoprolol given hypotension
   - Hold coumadin; rising INR likely [**1-13**] end-organ damage
   - Using vasopressin/neo for pressors
   # H/o PE: Remote per pt, on home coumadin although this could be for
   afib.  Negative v/q upon admission.
   - Hold coumadin with supratherapeutic INR.
   # Anemia: Stable. Baseline Hct ~24, attributed to myeloma and CLL. No
   evidence of significant ischemia on ECG presently and appears slightly
   volume overloaded, so will hold off on further transfusion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 84-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, PE, and recently transferred out of the MICU with presumed CAP, now transferred back to the MICU for persistent fevers, tachypnea, and hypotension.

The patient has been diagnosed with Septic Shock with multi-organ failure, Influenza A positive with CXR showing infiltrates involving entire R lung with P:F ratio 163 suggestive of ARDS. He is hypotensive requiring pressors and has metabolic acidosis and anuria.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Empyema: The patient continues to be febrile and has shock, which may indicate the development of an empyema.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS and is at risk for further respiratory failure.
3. Leukopenia: The patient is immunocompromised due to multiple myeloma and overwhelming infection, which may lead to further leukopenia.
4. Metabolic non-gap acidosis: The patient's acidosis is worsening, which may lead to further end-organ damage.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is rapidly worsening, which may lead to AKI.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is in atrial fibrillation and is at risk for further complications, such as stroke or heart failure.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, but may worsen if not properly managed.

The patient is receiving treatment for his conditions, including antibiotics, pressors, and respiratory support. However, further management and treatment are needed to address the patient's ongoing septic shock, respiratory failure, and other complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and hypoxemia. The patient's condition has been worsening over the last few weeks, and he remains anuric with increasing pressor requirement.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.3°F (38.5°C)
* Heart rate: 83 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 99/55 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 25 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.3 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 2.4 K/uL
* Platelet count: 84 K/uL
* Creatinine: 4.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.06 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.1 g/dL
* Calcium: 8.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 6.4 mg/dL

The patient is receiving various medications, including vasopressin, phenylephrine, midazolam, and fentanyl. He is also receiving oseltamivir for influenza A.

The patient's physical examination is significant for mottled extremities with barely dopplerable pulses. His skin is not assessed, and his neurologic examination is not complete due to his altered mental status.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, and increasing pressor requirement suggest sepsis as a possible complication.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory acidosis and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypoxemia increase his risk of cardiac arrest.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure, requiring dialysis.
5. Infection: The patient's anuria and increasing pressor requirement suggest the possibility of infection, which may worsen his condition.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen, leading to organ dysfunction and potential need for vasopressors.
7. Thrombosis: The patient's anuria and increasing pressor requirement increase his risk of thrombosis, particularly deep vein thrombosis.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anuria and increasing pressor requirement increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and potential need for cardioversion.

In summary, this patient is a 24-year-old male with a complex medical condition, including acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and hypoxemia. He is at risk for various medical complications, including sepsis, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, renal failure, infection, hypotension, thrombosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and cardiac arrhythmias."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and fever of unknown origin. The patient's condition has been deteriorating over the past few weeks, and he remains anuric with increasing pressor requirement.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 101.3°F (38.5°C)
* Heart rate: 83 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 99/55 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 25 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 2.4 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 84 K/uL
* Creatinine: 5.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.06 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.1 g/dL
* Calcium: 8.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 6.4 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Intubated with a endotracheal tube
* Irregularly irregular heart rhythm
* Crackles on the right lung field
* Mottled bilateral lower extremities with barely dopplerable pulses
* Sedated and unresponsive

The patient's medical history is significant for acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and fever of unknown origin. The patient's family history is significant for no known medical conditions.

Based on the patient's condition, potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis due to the patient's fever of unknown origin
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the patient's acute respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's atrial fibrillation
* Renal failure progression due to the patient's acute renal failure
* Infection due to the patient's anuria and increasing pressor requirement
* Hypotension due to the patient's hypovolemia and vasopressor requirement
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's acute respiratory failure and potential development of ARDS

The patient's care plan should focus on managing his acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and fever of unknown origin. The patient should be closely monitored for signs of sepsis, ARDS, cardiac arrhythmias, and infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   84M with h/o COPD, CAD, PE, recently transferred out of the MICU with
   presumed CAP, now transferred back to the MICU for persistent fevers,
   tachypnea, and hypotension.
   .
   # Septic Shock with MOF:  CXR now with PNA involving entire R lung,
   concerning for ARDS.  Lactate remains normal, but with metabolic
   acidosis and minimal urine output.  Hypotensive overnight requiring
   pressors.  A-line/CVL placed.
   - Concerned for empyema as continues to be febrile and continues to
   have shock. U/S lung today for drainable effusion.
   - Continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **].
   - Maintain MAP>55, CVP>12
   - F/u  UCx, Sputum Cx, BCx, bronch cultures
   - Start vasopressin to try to wean neo as tolerated.
   # Resp failure: Likely CAP with disease involving entire R lung and as
   above concern for empyema.  Currently with [**Doctor Last Name 2**] based on gas.
   - continue Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - decrease peep as tolerated now that sedated and not fighting vent
   - f/u sputum cx and bronch cultures
   - ultrasound today for possible thoracentesis if drainable empyema
   - Try lying on left side to aerate diseased lung better
   # Metabolic non-gap acidosis: Patient with pH of 7.30 this am, nl PCO2.
   Consider [**1-13**] to renal failure.
   - Increase respiratory rate to compensate
   # ARF: Renal consulted and suggests ARF related to multiple myeloma as
   urine sediment not consistent with intrinsic renal (ATN). Also consider
   AIN related.  Renal U/S without hydronephrosis.  Rapidly worsening
   overnight with minimal UOP
   - F/u Renal recs
   - Try vasopressin for better forward flow
   - Discuss with family CVVH
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # atrial fibrillation - currently in afib, on coumadin for h/o PE,
   though CHADs=1. s/p PPM for sick sinus syndrome.
   - holding metoprolol for now given ?hypotension
   - hold coumadin, goal INR >2.0.
   - Using neo for pressor as less tachycardia
   - PPM may not be sensing. Will cls EP to interrogate today.
   # h/o PE - remote per pt, on coumadin, though this could be for afib.
   negative v/q upon admission.
   - hold coumadin with supratherapeutic INR.
   # anemia - baseline hct ~24, attributed to myeloma and CLL.  no
   evidence of significant ischemia on ECG presently and appears slightly
   volume overloaded, so will hold off on further transfusion.
   - transfuse for HCT > 25

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, PE, and recently diagnosed with multiple myeloma and CLL. He was initially transferred to the MICU with presumed CAP, but was readmitted to the ICU due to persistent fevers, tachypnea, and hypotension.

The patient's current condition is complex and multifaceted, with several potential medical complications:

1. Septic Shock with Multi-Organ Failure (MOF): The patient has a high fever, tachypnea, and hypotension, which may indicate septic shock. The CXR shows a pneumonia involving the entire right lung, which is concerning for ARDS.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, which is elevated, and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The CXR shows a pneumonia involving the entire right lung, which may indicate CAP.
3. Metabolic Non-Gap Acidosis: The patient has a pH of 7.30, which is acidic, and a normal PCO2. This may indicate a metabolic acidosis.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has a creatinine level of 4.2 mg/dL, which is elevated, and is receiving dialysis. The renal ultrasound shows no hydronephrosis, which may indicate ARF related to multiple myeloma or AIN.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is in atrial fibrillation, which may be related to his history of PE and sick sinus syndrome. He is receiving anticoagulation therapy with coumadin, but the INR is supratherapeutic.
6. Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct of 24, which is attributed to his myeloma and CLL. He is not receiving further transfusions at this time.
7. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient has a fever of 101.3°F, which is elevated, and is being treated with antibiotics.

Potential complications that may arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure leading to ARDS
2. Septic shock leading to MOF
3. Acute kidney injury leading to ESRD
4. Atrial fibrillation leading to stroke or cardiac arrest
5. Anemia leading to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery
6. Fever of unknown origin leading to sepsis and organ dysfunction

To manage these conditions, the patient requires close monitoring and treatment with antibiotics, anticoagulation therapy, and mechanical ventilation. He also requires further evaluation and management of his respiratory, renal, and cardiac function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, an 84-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and PE, was transferred back to the ICU from the MICU due to persistent fevers, tachypnea, and hypotension. He was diagnosed with septic shock with multi-organ failure, influenza A positive, and ARDS. The patient's lactate levels are normal, but he has metabolic acidosis and anuria. He is hypotensive and requires pressors.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.5°F)
* Heart rate: 127 bpm
* Blood pressure: 74/49 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 95%
* SpO2: 95%
* Atrial fibrillation

The patient is intubated and sedated, and is receiving morphine for comfort. He is also receiving ventilation per family request.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has influenza A, which can lead to pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient has septic shock, which can lead to further organ failure.
3. ARDS: The patient has ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure.
4. Empyema: The patient has disease involving the entire right lung, which can lead to empyema.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, which can lead to further organ failure.
6. Anuria: The patient has anuria, which can lead to further kidney damage.
7. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, which can lead to further organ failure.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving ventilation, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
9. Infection: The patient has a high risk of infection due to his immunocompromised state.
10. Organ failure: The patient has multi-organ failure, which can lead to further organ failure if not managed properly.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   suggestive of ARDS. Lactate remains normal, but with metabolic acidosis
   and anuria. Hypotensive requiring pressors.
   - Concerned for empyema as continues to be febrile and continues to
   have shock but [**Female First Name (un) 231**] not consistent with goals of care
   - Continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/oseltamivir
   - F/u pending UCx, Sputum Cx, BCx, bronch cultures.
   - Cont vasopressin and neo to maintain MAP>55, CVP>12
   # Resp failure: Influenza A with disease involving entire R lung and as
   above concern for empyema.  Currently with ARDS based on P:F ratio.
   - Continue Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/oseltamivir
   - Decrease PEEP as tolerated; maintain Tv at goal 6 ml/kg
   - F/u sputum cx and bronch cultures
   - Try lying on left side to aerate diseased lung better
   - Thoracentesis not consistent with goals of care
   # Leukopenia: Immunocompromised in setting of multiple myeloma and now
   with overwhelming infection.
   - Neutropenic precautions pending diff
   - Cont above abx and supportive care
   - F/u cx
   - PCP and oncologist updated and confirm worsening multiple myeloma
   # Metabolic non-gap acidosis: Worsening acidosis; likely [**1-13**] to renal
   failure.
   # ARF: Likely related to multiple myeloma as urine sediment not
   consistent with intrinsic renal (ATN). Also consider AIN related.
   Renal U/S without hydronephrosis.  Rapidly worsening overnight with
   minimal UOP
   - F/u Renal recs
   - Unable to transition off neo despite vasopressin
   - CVVH not c/w goals of care
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Phos binders
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in afib, on coumadin at home for h/o
   PE, though CHADs=1. S/p PPM for sick sinus syndrome which is
   functioning but not capturing while in Afib per EP.
   - Appreciate EP recs
   - Holding metoprolol given hypotension
   - Hold coumadin; rising INR likely [**1-13**] end-organ damage
   - Using vasopressin/neo for pressors
   # Anemia: Stable. Baseline Hct ~24, attributed to myeloma and CLL. No
   evidence of significant ischemia on ECG presently and appears slightly
   volume overloaded, so will hold off on further transfusion.
   - Transfuse for HCT >21
   - Trend HCT
   - Continue folate, iron, b12 repletion.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, PE, and multiple myeloma, who was recently transferred back to the ICU for persistent fevers, tachypnea, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock with multi-organ failure, including ARDS, metabolic acidosis, and anuria.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 127 bpm, and blood pressure of 74/49 mmHg. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL and a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 95% on 50% FiO2.

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia, anemia, and elevated lactate levels. His blood cultures are pending, and he is receiving antibiotics for presumed CAP.

The patient's condition is concerning due to the development of septic shock, multi-organ failure, and the presence of ARDS. The patient's anuria and metabolic acidosis are also concerning signs of kidney injury.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Empyema: The patient's continued febrile and hypotensive state suggests the possibility of empyema, which could lead to further respiratory compromise and sepsis.
2. Renal failure: The patient's anuria and metabolic acidosis suggest worsening kidney function, which could lead to further electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS and hypoxemia could lead to further respiratory failure and the need for increased ventilatory support.
4. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock and multi-organ failure suggest the possibility of further sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
5. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and elevated INR suggest the possibility of bleeding, which could be exacerbated by the patient's anticoagulation therapy.
6. Infection: The patient's continued febrile state and positive blood cultures suggest the possibility of ongoing infection, which could lead to further sepsis and organ dysfunction.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia suggest the possibility of cardiovascular instability, which could lead to further organ dysfunction and failure.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely to ensure that his condition does not worsen."
