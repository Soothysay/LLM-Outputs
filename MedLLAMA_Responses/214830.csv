You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of their condition:

The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and suspected aspiration pneumonia. They have been on CPAP for much of the day and night, with minimal subcutaneous emphysema noted on a recent CTA. The patient has also developed fluid in the right lower lobe and right middle lobe bronchi, with atelectasis and patchy consolidation suspicious for pneumonia. Additionally, there are findings suggestive of interstitial edema.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, and blood pressure of 107/53 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy and have a SpO2 of 99%. Their respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV with a Vt of 510 mL and PS of 6 cmH2O.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 13.1, hemoglobin of 11.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 443 K/uL. Their electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated lactate level of 1.3 mmol/L.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their critical condition, with no assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, or other systems.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest aspiration pneumonia, which can progress to sepsis and multi-organ failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and need for CPAP/PSV may indicate a risk of respiratory failure, particularly if their underlying condition worsens or if they develop complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate level suggest a potential risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not recognized and treated promptly.
4. DVT: The patient's immobility and critical condition may increase their risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can lead to pulmonary embolism and other complications.
5. VAP: The patient's use of endotracheal tubes and mechanical ventilation increases their risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which can lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical condition and use of corticosteroids may increase their risk of developing stress ulcers, which can lead to bleeding and other complications.
7. Neurologic complications: The patient's critical condition and use of sedatives and analgesics may increase their risk of developing neurologic complications, such as seizures or delirium."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a complex medical history, including CAD, CHF, COPD, and a recent tracheostomy with subsequent fistula closure. She is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, ARF, and bacteremia.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with worsening respiratory distress, tachypnea, and decreased oxygen saturation. The CTA shows minimal subcutaneous emphysema along both anterior chest walls, no PE, and findings suspicious for interstitial edema and pneumonia. The patient is at risk for VAP, and the plan includes treatment with Vanc/Zosyn and Cipro for additional coverage of GNRs.

The patient's ARF is also a concern, with a BUN of 30 mg/dL and a creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL. The differential diagnosis includes pre-renal azotemia, ATN/AIN from medications, and possible infection. The plan is to hold diuresis, hold lisinopril, and renally dose antibiotics.

The patient's cardiac status is also a concern, with a recent TTE showing preserved EF with some focal wall motion abnormality. The plan is to caution with fluids, monitor I/Os, and continue beta blockers.

The patient's bacteremia is also a concern, with a recent positive blood culture showing MRSA. The plan is to continue vancomycin to complete 14-day treatment and monitor for evidence of seeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening respiratory distress and pneumonia increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and pneumonia increase the risk of sepsis.
3. ARF: The patient's ARF and possible infection increase the risk of further renal dysfunction.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status and possible volume overload increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and pneumonia increase the risk of further infection.
6. Thrombotic complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and possible hypercoagulability increase the risk of thrombotic complications, such as DVT or PE.

In summary, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and aggressive treatment are necessary to prevent further deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a complex medical history, including CAD, CHF, COPD, and a complicated pulmonary history with recent decannulation and fistula closure. She is currently admitted to the ICU for worsening respiratory distress and is being treated for aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, and blood pressure of 107/53 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and is on CPAP/PSV mode with a FiO2 of 60%. Her respiratory support is adequate, with a SpO2 of 99%.

The patient's physical examination reveals no signs of respiratory distress, with no crackles or wheezing heard in the lungs. Her cardiac examination is normal, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Her abdomen is soft, and her extremities show no signs of edema.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (13.1 K/uL), a normal hemoglobin level (11.1 g/dL), and an elevated troponin-T level (0.03 ng/mL). Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level (4.8 mEq/L).

The patient's plan of care includes aggressive chest physical therapy, suctioning, and supplemental oxygen as needed. She is also receiving antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia and is being monitored for signs of sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: Given the patient's history of COPD and aspiration pneumonia, she is at risk for developing respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: With an elevated white blood cell count and a history of bacteremia, the patient is at risk for developing sepsis.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and CHF puts her at risk for developing cardiac complications, such as acute coronary syndrome or heart failure.
4. Pneumonia progression: The patient's aspiration pneumonia could progress and lead to more severe respiratory distress or even sepsis.
5. ARF: The patient's elevated creatinine level and history of kidney disease put her at risk for developing acute renal failure.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count could be indicative of an underlying infection or inflammation.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's history of diabetes and use of insulin therapy puts her at risk for developing hyperglycemia.
8. DVT: The patient's history of CAD and CHF puts her at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis.

Overall, the patient's complex medical history and current respiratory distress require close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent potential complications and improve her clinical outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) who has been experiencing respiratory distress and has required non-invasive ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 96 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 104/54 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 100%. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 510 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 6 cmH2O.

The patient has a history of allergies to heparin agents, thrombocytopenia, and Percocet (oxycodone/acetaminophen). The patient has received antibiotics, including Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 443 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, with a potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L and a sodium level of 141 mEq/L.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's requirement for non-invasive ventilation and CPAP/PSV ventilation suggests that the patient may be at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and the presence of a central line may increase the risk of sepsis.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's history of thrombocytopenia and the presence of a central line may increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Infection: The patient's requirement for antibiotics and the presence of a central line may increase the risk of infection.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, but the patient may still be at risk for hypotension due to the presence of vasopressors and the patient's underlying medical condition.
6. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level and the presence of a central line may increase the risk of acute kidney injury.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of cardiac arrhythmias and the presence of a central line may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Pneumonia: The patient's requirement for oxygen therapy and the presence of a central line may increase the risk of pneumonia.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's requirement for non-invasive ventilation and CPAP/PSV ventilation may increase the risk of VAP.
10. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of DVT and the presence of a central line may increase the risk of DVT.

Overall, the patient is at risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent these complications and ensure the patient's safety and well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   67yo woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG, complicated pulmonary history
   including tracheobronchiomalacia, trach / decannulation, and recent
   tracheal fistula repair (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) c/b MRSA
   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress. Attempts were made in
   MICU to take her off NIPPV but her FiO2 requirement shot up to 100%-
   now back down on minimal PAP. So far her CXR and ENT eval do not appear
   acutely worsened from several days ago prior to hospital d/c . Her
   recent worsening appears most consistent with a multifactorial
   etiology:  upper airway procedure (fistula repair) with upper airway
   edema, bronchospasm/COPD, recent MRSA pneumonia. No problems with the
   surgical site.  Suspect mucus plug as the etilogy
   1) ID: CTA demonstrated RLL and RML infiltrate when compared to CT back
   in [**Month (only) 2605**] was present then.  Will complete a 8 day course of antibiotics.
   2) Cardiac: She has a h/o diastolic CHF, however, her current
   presentation is not overly suggestive of a CHF exacerbation being her
   primary issue. Would aim for I/O to be euvolumic.
   3) Renal: Creatinine 1.3. Follow in the setting of anticipate CTA.
   4) COPD / tracheobronchiomalacia: Would provide standing nebs,
   Albuterol / Atrovent q4hr and q2hr PRN.   Will hold steroids no evidenc
   of wheeze on exam, Guaifenesin and chest PT. NIPPV overnight and as
   needed during the day. Should she require intubation, would do it with
   fiberoptic guidance given her recent surgery.   Would also follow with
   repeat CT scan once clear to evaluate for resolution of findinds
   otherwise would consider bronchoscopy to evaluate for obstruction.
   5) F/E/N: Cardiac prudent diet. Speech and swallow evaluation for
   chronic aspiration.  Follow / replete  lytes as needed. Goal euvolumic
   for now.
   6) Hosp: Access - pIV, code - full, proph - PPI and SCDs.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, s/p coronary artery bypass grafting, and complicated pulmonary history, including tracheobronchiomalacia, tracheal decannulation, and recent tracheal fistula repair. She presented with respiratory distress and was diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia.

The patient's current condition is concerning for respiratory distress, with a recent worsening of her symptoms. The assessment suggests that the etiology of her worsening is multifactorial, including upper airway procedure-related upper airway edema, bronchospasm/COPD, and recent MRSA pneumonia. The patient's recent chest X-ray and ENT evaluation do not appear acutely worsened from several days ago.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 11.1 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 13.1 K/uL
* Platelet count: 443 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Glucose: 70 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Na 141 mEq/L, K 30.5 mEq/L, Cl 101 mEq/L, Ca 9.3 mg/dL, Mg 1.9 mg/dL, PO4 3.3 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Chronic illness appearance
* Mild accessory muscle use while breathing
* S1S2 soft heart sounds
* Irregular rhythm
* No heave
* JVP at 8-10 cm without HJR
* CTA bilaterally with right basilar crackles and upper airway wheezing
* Abdomen: obese, positive bowel sounds, and no guarding
* Neuro: awake, alert, and answering questions appropriately

The patient's plan includes:

* Completion of an 8-day course of antibiotics
* Cardiac monitoring to aim for euvolemia
* Renal monitoring for creatinine levels
* COPD/tracheobronchiomalacia management with standing nebs, albuterol/atropine, and guaifenesin
* NIPPV overnight and as needed during the day
* Fiberoptic guidance for intubation if necessary
* Repeat CT scan once clear to evaluate for resolution of findings
* Bronchoscopy to evaluate for obstruction if necessary

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Renal insufficiency
* Pneumonia complications (e.g., abscesses, empyema)
* COPD exacerbation
* Tracheobronchiomalacia worsening
* Upper airway edema and obstruction
* Infection (e.g., MRSA, other bacterial or fungal infections)
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
* Neurological complications (e.g., seizures, stroke)

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan as needed to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   67yo woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG, complicated pulmonary history
   including tracheobronchiomalacia, trach / decannulation, and recent
   tracheal fistula repair (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) c/b MRSA
   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress. Attempts were made in
   MICU to take her off NIPPV but her FiO2 requirement shot up to 100%-
   now back down on minimal PAP. So far her CXR and ENT eval do not appear
   acutely worsened from several days ago prior to hospital d/c . Her
   recent worsening appears most consistent with a multifactorial
   etiology:  upper airway procedure (fistula repair) with upper airway
   edema, bronchospasm/COPD, recent MRSA pneumonia. No problems with the
   surgical site.  Suspect mucus plug as the etiology
   1) ID: CTA demonstrated RLL and RML infiltrate when compared to CT back
   in [**Month (only) 2605**] was present then.  Will complete a 8 day course of antibiotics.
   2) Cardiac: She has a h/o diastolic CHF, however, her current
   presentation is not overly suggestive of a CHF exacerbation being her
   primary issue. Would aim for I/O to be euvolumic.
   3) Renal: Creatinine 1.3. Follow in the setting of  CTA.
   4) COPD / tracheobronchiomalacia: Would provide standing nebs,
   Albuterol / Atrovent q4hr and q2hr PRN.   Will hold steroids no evidenc
   of wheeze on exam, Guaifenesin and chest PT. NIPPV overnight and as
   needed during the day. Should she require intubation, would do it with
   fiberoptic guidance given her recent surgery.   Would also follow with
   repeat CT scan once clear to evaluate for resolution of findings
   otherwise would consider bronchoscopy to evaluate for obstruction.
   5) F/E/N: Cardiac prudent diet. Speech and swallow evaluation for
   chronic aspiration.  Follow / replete  lytes as needed. Goal euvolumic
   for now.
   6) Hosp: Access - pIV, code - full, proph - PPI and SCDs.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   67yo woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG, complicated pulmonary history
   including tracheobronchiomalacia, trach / decannulation, and recent
   tracheal fistula repair (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) c/b MRSA
   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress. Extubated [**9-18**], d/c'ed
   home [**9-20**] on Bactrim DS presumptively for extended coverage of her MRSA
   pneumonia (despite having completed course of Vanc.) At ~1AM this
   morning she developed shortness of breath when she got up to go to the
   bathroom. No cough, fevers, chills. She went back to bed, slept for ~1
   hour on CPAP but awoke again with persistent shortness of breath and
   presented to the ER for further evaluation. Denies chest pain /
   pressure, orthopnea, PND. She feels that her volume overload is
   improving. She denies leg swelling or pain. Persistent cough productive
   of white sputum, no purulence noted. No wheezing or stridor.
   24 Hour Events: Was on Bipap overnight.  Received CTA here which was
   negative.  RML and RLL PNA.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and a recent tracheal fistula repair. She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and was diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia. She was treated with antibiotics and non-invasive ventilation (NIPPV) and was discharged home on Bactrim DS. However, she presented to the ER again with shortness of breath and was readmitted to the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, and blood pressure of 104/54 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV. She has mild accessory muscle use and bilateral crackles on lung examination.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 13.1 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 32.3%
* Plt: 443 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 1.3 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.03 ng/mL
* Glucose: 70 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 15.2/31.1/1.3, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 92/6/<0.01, Differential-Neuts: 89.8%, Band: 0.0%, Lymph: 6.9%, Mono: 2.4%, Eos: 0.7%, Lactic Acid: 1.3 mmol/L, Ca++: 9.3 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 3.3 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* ID: CTA demonstrated RLL and RML infiltrate, and she will complete an 8-day course of antibiotics.
* Cardiac: She has a history of diastolic CHF, but her current presentation is not suggestive of a CHF exacerbation being her primary issue.
* Renal: Creatinine 1.3, and follow-up will be done in the setting of CTA.
* COPD/tracheobronchiomalacia: Provide standing nebs, Albuterol/Atrovent q4hr and q2hr PRN, and hold steroids due to no evidence of wheeze on exam.
* F/E/N: Cardiac prudent diet, speech and swallow evaluation for chronic aspiration, and follow-up to replete electrolytes as needed.
* Hosp: Access-pIV, code-full, proph-PPI and SCDs.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure due to worsening pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Cardiac complications, such as heart failure exacerbation or arrhythmias, due to her history of CAD and diastolic CHF
* Renal failure due to acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD)
* Infection complications, such as sepsis or septic shock, due to ongoing MRSA pneumonia
* Mucus plug formation and obstruction of the upper airway, which can lead to respiratory failure
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or constipation, due to antibiotics or other medications
* Electrolyte imbalance or acid-base disorders due to ongoing medical treatment and underlying conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   67yo woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG, complicated pulmonary history
   including tracheobronchiomalacia, trach / decannulation, and recent
   tracheal fistula repair (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) c/b MRSA
   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress. Attempts were made in
   MICU to take her off NIPPV but her FiO2 requirement shot up to 100%-
   now back down on minimal PAP. So far her CXR and ENT eval do not appear
   acutely worsened from several days ago prior to hospital d/c . Her
   recent worsening appears most consistent with a multifactorial
   etiology:  upper airway procedure (fistula repair) with upper airway
   edema, bronchospasm/COPD, recent MRSA pneumonia. No problems with the
   surgical site.  Suspect mucus plug as the etiology
   1) ID: CTA demonstrated RLL and RML infiltrate when compared to CT back
   in [**Month (only) 2605**] was present then.  Will complete a 8 day course of antibiotics.
   2) Cardiac: She has a h/o diastolic CHF, however, her current
   presentation is not overly suggestive of a CHF exacerbation being her
   primary issue. Would aim for I/O to be euvolumic.
   3) Renal: Creatinine 1.3. Follow in the setting of  CTA.
   4) COPD / tracheobronchiomalacia: Would provide standing nebs,
   Albuterol / Atrovent q4hr and q2hr PRN.   Will hold steroids no evidenc
   of wheeze on exam, Guaifenesin and chest PT. NIPPV overnight and as
   needed during the day. Should she require intubation, would do it with
   fiberoptic guidance given her recent surgery.   Would also follow with
   repeat CT scan once clear to evaluate for resolution of findings
   otherwise would consider bronchoscopy to evaluate for obstruction.
   5) F/E/N: Cardiac prudent diet. Speech and swallow evaluation for
   chronic aspiration.  Follow / replete  lytes as needed. Goal euvolumic
   for now.
   6) Hosp: Access - pIV, code - full, proph - PPI and SCDs.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   67yo woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG, complicated pulmonary history
   including tracheobronchiomalacia, trach / decannulation, and recent
   tracheal fistula repair (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) c/b MRSA
   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress. Extubated [**9-18**], d/c'ed
   home [**9-20**] on Bactrim DS presumptively for extended coverage of her MRSA
   pneumonia (despite having completed course of Vanc.) At ~1AM this
   morning she developed shortness of breath when she got up to go to the
   bathroom. No cough, fevers, chills. She went back to bed, slept for ~1
   hour on CPAP but awoke again with persistent shortness of breath and
   presented to the ER for further evaluation. Denies chest pain /
   pressure, orthopnea, PND. She feels that her volume overload is
   improving. She denies leg swelling or pain. Persistent cough productive
   of white sputum, no purulence noted. No wheezing or stridor.
   24 Hour Events: Was on Bipap overnight.  Received CTA here which was
   negative.  RML and RLL PNA.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and recent tracheal fistula repair for MRSA pneumonia. She was extubated and discharged home on Bactrim DS but presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and was readmitted to the ICU. She has a complicated pulmonary history, including tracheobronchiomalacia, tracheal decannulation, and recent tracheal fistula repair. Her current presentation is consistent with a multifactorial etiology, including upper airway edema, bronchospasm/COPD, and recent MRSA pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recent tracheal fistula repair and upper airway edema may lead to respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's recent MRSA pneumonia and prolonged mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of VAP.
3. Pneumonia Progression: The patient's recent MRSA pneumonia may progress, leading to worsening respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of diastolic CHF and recent tracheal fistula repair may lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiac tamponade or pulmonary edema.
5. Renal Complications: The patient's recent tracheal fistula repair and prolonged mechanical ventilation may lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
6. Tracheal Obstruction: The patient's recent tracheal fistula repair and tracheobronchiomalacia may lead to tracheal obstruction, requiring bronchoscopy or other interventions.
7. Mucus Plug: The patient's recent tracheal fistula repair and upper airway edema may lead to mucus plug formation, requiring bronchoscopy or other interventions.
8. Upper Airway Edema: The patient's recent tracheal fistula repair and upper airway edema may lead to upper airway obstruction, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics for 8 days to complete the course.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely, with a focus on oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Provide standing nebs, Albuterol/Atrovent q4hr and q2hr PRN, and consider bronchoscopy to evaluate for obstruction.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, with a focus on cardiac tamponade or pulmonary edema.
5. Monitor the patient's renal status closely, with a focus on AKI or CKD.
6. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis.
7. Monitor the patient's glycemic control closely, with a focus on hyperglycemia.
8. Consider transfer to the floor once the patient's respiratory status improves and they are stable."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a complicated pulmonary history, including a history of pseudomonas pneumonia, tracheomalacia, and supraglottic stenosis. She was recently admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and was intubated due to respiratory arrest.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.6°F)
* Heart rate: 133 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 156/83 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 83%
* Mixed venous oxygen saturation: 80-80%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 13.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 380 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Glucose: 70 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.03 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 6.6 mmol/L

The patient's imaging studies show:

* A CTA on 9/22 showed no pulmonary embolism and findings compatible with aspiration within the right lower and middle lobe bronchi, with atelectasis and airspace consolidation suspicious for pneumonia.
* A barium swallow on 9/23 showed no evidence of gastroesophageal reflux and a small-to-moderate hiatal hernia.

The patient's respiratory support includes:

* Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) was stopped on 9/23
* Intubation was performed on 9/24 due to respiratory arrest
* The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 580 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 12 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 6 cmH2O.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Respiratory arrest
* Pneumonia
* Tracheomalacia
* Supraglottic stenosis
* Pulmonary edema
* Flash pulmonary edema
* Mucous plug
* Recurrent PNA
* Tracheocutaneous fistula

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pneumonia progression or worsening
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiovascular instability
* Hemodynamic compromise
* Metabolic acidosis
* Sepsis
* Multi-organ dysfunction syndrome
* Prolonged mechanical ventilation
* Tracheostomy-related complications

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to ensure prompt recognition and management of any potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a complicated pulmonary history, including pseudomonas pneumonia, tracheomalacia, and tracheocutaneous fistula repair. She has been hospitalized multiple times for pneumonia and flash pulmonary edema.

The patient's current condition is acute respiratory distress, with a respiratory arrest episode on the 24th. She was intubated and has been receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 133 beats per minute, blood pressure of 156/83 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 83%.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications, including:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pseudomonas pneumonia and has been treated with antibiotics. However, she continues to have respiratory distress and may have developed a new infection.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recent respiratory arrest and worsening respiratory distress may be related to aspiration pneumonia. A barium swallow study showed no overt aspiration, but there may be silent aspiration.
3. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory arrest and need for mechanical ventilation suggest acute respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and cardiomyopathy. She may be at risk for cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock.
5. Renal failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation may lead to renal failure.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of bacteremia and may be at risk for sepsis.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be related to infection or inflammation.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be related to infection, inflammation, or bleeding.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving antibiotics for pneumonia, and her antibiotic regimen will be continued.
2. Mechanical ventilation: The patient will continue to receive mechanical ventilation to support her respiratory function.
3. Chest physical therapy: The patient will receive aggressive chest physical therapy to help improve her lung function.
4. SLP evaluation: The patient will undergo a speech-language pathology evaluation to assess her swallowing function.
5. Barium swallow: The patient will undergo a barium swallow study to evaluate her swallowing function.
6. Monitoring: The patient will be closely monitored for signs of infection, cardiac complications, and renal failure.

In conclusion, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a complicated pulmonary history who is currently experiencing acute respiratory distress. She has a number of potential medical complications, including pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, cardiac complications, renal failure, infection, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. Her treatment plan includes antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, chest physical therapy, SLP evaluation, barium swallow, and close monitoring."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 67F with complicated pulmonary history.  Initiated in
   [**1-27**] when had THR, complicated post op course with prolonged
   intubation, with associated pseudomonas PNA, trach/PEG with resultant
   supraglottic stenosis and tracheomalacia.  Had laser treatment of
   granulation tissue in trachea in [**11-28**] and trach decannulation in
   [**3-29**].  Past year has been complicated by multiple admissions for both
   PNA and flash pulm edema.  Hospitalized late [**8-/2138**] for take down of
   tracheocutaneous fistula ([**9-12**]), had postop MRSA PNA/bacteremia treated
   with vanc. Discharged home on [**9-20**] on PO bactrim, represented in acute
   respiratory distress in [**9-22**] despite home BIPAP. Working ddx was mucous
   plug vs recurrent PNA.  Has received IV decadron x 3 for slight airway
   swelling seen on laryngoscope on admission.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated, with acute shortness of breath and desaturation to 50's. The patient was intubated and requires aggressive chest PT. The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, and mucous plug.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine has increased, and the differential diagnosis includes pre-renal azotemia, acute tubular necrosis, and acute interstitial nephritis. The plan is to hold diuresis, hold lisinopril, and re-dose antibiotics.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of CAD, CHF, and COPD. The patient's cardiac status is being monitored, and the plan is to continue ASA and BB.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of MRSA bacteremia and is at risk for seeding of the infection. The patient is being treated with IV vancomycin and will complete a 14-day course. Blood cultures are being monitored, and the patient is at risk for C. diff.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and the differential diagnosis includes infection, inflammation, or reaction to antibiotics. The patient is being monitored for signs of infection, and blood cultures are being checked.
6. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism, and the plan is to monitor for signs of PE.
7. Aspiration: The patient has a history of aspiration, and the plan is to evaluate the patient for silent aspiration using a swallow study.
8. Tracheomalacia: The patient has a history of tracheomalacia, and the plan is to monitor for signs of tracheomalacia.

The patient's current medications include:

* Antibiotics: IV vancomycin, PO bactrim, and Zosyn
* Pain management: Morphine sulfate
* Respiratory support: BiPAP and CPAP
* Cardiovascular medications: ASA, BB, and lisinopril
* Anti-anxiety medication: Ativan
* Statin for hyperlipidemia
* Lamotrigine, quetiapine, and sertraline for depression and anxiety

The patient's plan includes:

* Intubation and aggressive chest PT for respiratory distress
* Antibiotic treatment for pneumonia and bacteremia
* Monitoring for signs of infection and seeding
* Evaluation for silent aspiration using a swallow study
* Monitoring for signs of tracheomalacia
* Cardiovascular monitoring to rule out cardiac complications
* Close monitoring of renal function to prevent ARF
* Close monitoring of electrolytes and fluid balance to prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a complicated pulmonary history, including prolonged post-op course of intubation, pseudomonas pneumonia, tracheostomy, and tracheomalacia. She has been hospitalized multiple times for pneumonia and flash pulmonary edema.

The patient was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress, which required intubation. She has been receiving aggressive chest physical therapy, nebulizers, and antibiotics. The patient's lactate level is elevated at 6.6, indicating hypoperfusion.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are normal, ruling out myocardial infarction. However, she has a history of CAD, CHF, and COPD.

The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with decreased lung compliance and increased respiratory resistance. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 12 cmH2O and FiO2 of 80%. Her ABG results show a pH of 31, indicating respiratory acidosis.

The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 3.3 mg/dL and a magnesium level of 2.2 mg/dL. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is elevated at 16 mg/dL, indicating kidney dysfunction.

The patient's medical history is significant for depression, anxiety, hyperlipidemia, and leukocytosis. She is receiving treatment for these conditions, including antidepressants, antianxiety medications, and a statin.

The patient's current medications include:

* Propofol
* Phenylephrine
* Morphine sulfate
* Furosemide (Lasix)
* Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn)
* Vancomycin
* Ciprofloxacin
* Aspirin
* Protonix

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue aggressive chest physical therapy and nebulizers
* Continue antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia
* Wean off pressors as tolerated
* Recheck lactate and ABG results
* Place an arterial line and recheck ABG results
* Continue ASA and BB therapy
* Hold ACEI for ARF
* Monitor I/Os and electrolyte levels
* Continue IV lasix and diuretics as needed
* Consider tracheostomy today
* Monitor for signs of infection, including fever, leukocytosis, and bacteremia
* Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Sepsis
* Kidney dysfunction
* Electrolyte imbalance
* Depression and anxiety exacerbation
* Leukocytosis and neutropenia
* C. difficile colitis
* Hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease exacerbation"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 67F with complicated pulmonary history.  Initiated in
   [**1-27**] when had THR, complicated post op course with prolonged
   intubation, with associated pseudomonas PNA, trach/PEG with resultant
   supraglottic stenosis and tracheomalacia.  Had laser treatment of
   granulation tissue in trachea in [**11-28**] and trach decannulation in
   [**3-29**].  Past year has been complicated by multiple admissions for both
   PNA and flash pulm edema.  Hospitalized late [**8-/2138**] for take down of
   tracheocutaneous fistula ([**9-12**]), had postop MRSA PNA/bacteremia treated
   with vanc. Discharged home on [**9-20**] on PO bactrim, represented in acute
   respiratory distress in [**9-22**] despite home BIPAP. Working ddx was mucous
   plug vs recurrent PNA.  Has received IV decadron x 3 for slight airway
   swelling seen on laryngoscope on admission.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications are potential:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress, requiring intubation, is a significant concern. The etiology is unclear, but possible causes include aspiration pneumonia, mucous plugging, bronchospasm, and tracheal stenosis/edema.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension, requiring neosynephrine, is concerning, especially with an elevated lactate level of 6.6. The cause is unclear, but possible causes include sepsis, cardiac failure, or medication-related issues.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac enzymes are normal, but the patient's cardiac history includes CAD, CHF, and recent CABG. The patient's cardiac function is being monitored, and cardiac medications are being adjusted.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and the patient is at risk for AKI due to the combination of respiratory failure, hypotension, and potential nephrotoxic medications.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of MRSA pneumonia, and the possibility of ongoing infection is high. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and blood cultures are pending.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent upper airway procedure may have caused upper airway edema, which could lead to gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, or abdominal distension.
7. Depression and anxiety: The patient has a history of depression and anxiety, and the patient's recent hospitalization and respiratory failure may exacerbate these conditions.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, and the patient's recent hospitalization may have affected their lipid levels.
9. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be a sign of infection or inflammation. The patient's differential count is normal, but the possibility of c. diff or other infections is high.

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

1. Respiratory support: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, and the plan is to wean off the ventilator as tolerated.
2. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving antibiotics for suspected aspiration pneumonia, and the plan is to complete a 14-day course of IV vancomycin.
3. Cardiovascular support: The patient is receiving cardiac medications, and the plan is to monitor the patient's cardiac function closely.
4. Renal support: The patient is at risk for AKI, and the plan is to monitor the patient's creatinine level and adjust medications as needed.
5. Gastrointestinal support: The patient is receiving tube feeds, and the plan is to monitor the patient's bowel movement and adjust the bowel regimen as needed.
6. Infection control: The patient is receiving antibiotics, and the plan is to monitor the patient's blood cultures and adjust antibiotics as needed.
7. Psychiatric support: The patient is receiving psychiatric medications, and the plan is to monitor the patient's mental status closely."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and was initially treated with non-invasive ventilation. However, due to worsening respiratory status, they required intubation and invasive ventilation. The patient has a complex medical history, including a respiratory arrest, and is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and vasopressors.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 99/42 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. However, they are requiring high levels of oxygen supplementation and mechanical ventilation.

The patient has a range of laboratory abnormalities, including thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate levels, and altered electrolyte levels. They are also experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding and have a high risk of developing deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and they may continue to experience respiratory failure if their condition does not improve.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to their underlying medical conditions and the presence of a central line and other invasive devices.
3. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient is at high risk of developing deep vein thrombosis due to their immobility and the presence of a central line.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient is at high risk of developing stress ulcers due to their critical illness and the use of corticosteroids.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, which may worsen their condition and increase their risk of developing complications.
6. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing infection due to their underlying medical conditions and the presence of invasive devices.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiovascular status is unstable, and they may experience further cardiovascular instability if their condition does not improve.
8. Renal failure: The patient's electrolyte levels are altered, and they may be at risk of developing renal failure if their condition does not improve."

   Assessment and Plan
   67yo woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG, complicated pulmonary history
   including tracheobronchiomalacia, trach / decannulation, and recent
   tracheal fistula repair (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) c/b MRSA
   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress. Her recent worsening
   appears most consistent with a multifactorial etiology:  upper airway
   procedure (fistula repair) with upper airway edema, bronchospasm/COPD,
   recent MRSA pneumonia. No problems with the surgical site.  Suspect
   mucus plug as the etiology
   1) ID: CTA demonstrated RLL and RML infiltrate when compared to CT back

   antibiotics.  On vanc/cipro/zosyn for VAP.
   2) Cardiac: She has a h/o diastolic CHF, however, her current
   presentation is not overly suggestive of a CHF exacerbation being her
   primary issue. Would aim for I/O to be euvolumic.  Trend cardiac
   enzymes given event overnight.
   3) Renal: Creatinine 1.2. Follow in the setting of  CTA.
   4) COPD / tracheobronchiomalacia: Acute event overnight appears to be
   due to a mucus plug, likely complicated by underlying airway
   pathology.  [**Month (only) 60**] have tracheal stenosis or granulation tissue at level
   of prior trach complicating the situation.  Will discuss with IP
   possibility of bronch today (cannot bronch through ETT given 6.5
   tube).  Continue nebs.
   5) F/E/N: Cardiac prudent diet. Speech and swallow evaluation for
   chronic aspiration.  Follow / replete  lytes as needed. Goal euvolumic
   for now.
   6) Shock:  Requiring neosynephrine overnight with an elevated lactate.
   No evidence of intraabdominal pathology to explain the lactate.  Will
   recheck.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, tracheobronchiomalacia, and recent tracheal fistula repair due to MRSA pneumonia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and has been experiencing worsening hypoxemia and respiratory distress. She was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to a respiratory arrest. The patient has a complex medical history, including diastolic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and tracheobronchiomalacia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to her prolonged mechanical ventilation and underlying respiratory conditions.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, with contributing factors including upper airway edema, bronchospasm, and COPD.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure, and her current presentation is not overly suggestive of a CHF exacerbation being her primary issue. However, her cardiac enzymes are being trended, and she is receiving neosynephrine for hypotension.
4. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine is elevated at 1.2, and she is at risk for further renal dysfunction due to her underlying conditions and medications.
5. Tracheobronchiomalacia: The patient has underlying tracheobronchiomalacia, which is likely contributing to her respiratory distress and airway complications.
6. Mucus plug: The patient's recent respiratory arrest may have been caused by a mucus plug, which could recur and exacerbate her respiratory distress.
7. Sepsis: The patient has a history of MRSA pneumonia, and her recent worsening may be related to sepsis.
8. Metabolic complications: The patient's glucose levels are being monitored, and she is at risk for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to her underlying conditions and medications.
9. Nutritional complications: The patient is at risk for malnutrition due to her underlying conditions and limited oral intake.

Recommendations:

1. Continue invasive ventilation and monitor the patient's respiratory status closely.
2. Administer antibiotics for VAP and monitor for signs of infection.
3. Trend cardiac enzymes and monitor for signs of cardiac complications.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medications as needed.
5. Continue to manage the patient's tracheobronchiomalacia and airway complications.
6. Monitor for signs of sepsis and adjust antibiotics as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
8. Consider tube feeds and monitor the patient's nutritional status.
9. Monitor the patient's lactate levels and adjust neosynephrine therapy as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   67yo woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG, complicated pulmonary history
   including tracheobronchiomalacia, trach / decannulation, and recent
   tracheal fistula repair (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) c/b MRSA
   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress. Her recent worsening
   appears most consistent with a multifactorial etiology:  upper airway
   procedure (fistula repair) with upper airway edema, bronchospasm/COPD,
   recent MRSA pneumonia. No problems with the surgical site.  Suspect
   mucus plug as the etiology
   1) ID: CTA demonstrated RLL and RML infiltrate when compared to CT back
   in [**Month (only) 2605**] was present then.  Will complete a 8 day course of
   antibiotics.  On vanc/cipro/zosyn for VAP.
   2) Cardiac: She has a h/o diastolic CHF, however, her current
   presentation is not overly suggestive of a CHF exacerbation being her
   primary issue. Would aim for I/O to be euvolumic.  Trend cardiac
   enzymes given event overnight.
   3) Renal: Creatinine 1.2. Follow in the setting of  CTA.
   4) COPD / tracheobronchiomalacia: Acute event overnight appears to be
   due to a mucus plug, likely complicated by underlying airway
   pathology.  [**Month (only) 60**] have tracheal stenosis or granulation tissue at level
   of prior trach complicating the situation.  Will discuss with IP
   possibility of bronch today (cannot bronch through ETT given 6.5
   tube).  Continue nebs.
   5) F/E/N: Cardiac prudent diet. Speech and swallow evaluation for
   chronic aspiration.  Follow / replete  lytes as needed. Goal euvolumic
   for now.
   6) Shock:  Requiring neosynephrine overnight with an elevated lactate.
   No evidence of intraabdominal pathology to explain the lactate.  Will
   recheck.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, tracheobronchiomalacia, and a recent tracheal fistula repair due to MRSA pneumonia. The patient presented with respiratory failure and was intubated due to acute respiratory distress.

The patient's recent worsening appears to be multifactorial, with potential etiologies including upper airway edema, bronchospasm/COPD, and recent MRSA pneumonia. The patient's current condition is critical, with ongoing respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and hypotension.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated white blood cell count (13.1 K/uL)
* Elevated lactate level (6.6 mmol/L)
* Elevated troponin-T level (0.03 ng/mL)
* Elevated creatinine level (1.2 mg/dL)
* Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level (16 mg/dL)

The patient's chest X-ray shows a right lower lobe (RLL) and right middle lobe (RML) infiltrate.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Completion of an 8-day course of antibiotics for VAP
* Cardiac management, including cardiac enzymes and ionotropic support
* Renal management, including close monitoring of creatinine and BUN levels
* COPD/tracheobronchiomalacia management, including bronchoscopy and nebulization
* F/E/N management, including speech and swallow evaluation and repletion of electrolytes as needed
* Shock management, including vasopressor support and recheck of lactate levels

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Cardiac complications, including diastolic heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias
* Renal failure and acute kidney injury
* COPD exacerbation and bronchospasm
* Tracheal stenosis or granulation tissue at the level of the prior tracheostomy
* Mucus plug formation and potential respiratory arrest
* Electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances
* Infection and sepsis

Given the patient's critical condition and complex medical history, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory and cardiovascular function to prevent potential complications and optimize her care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a complex medical condition. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 91/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a FiO2 of 50%.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -160 mL over the past 24 hours, with a total infusion of 2,004 mL and a total output of 2,164 mL. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and sedatives.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 474 K/uL. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL. The patient's liver function is also impaired, with a troponin-T level of 0.13 ng/mL.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 550 mL. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a peak inspiratory pressure of 32 cmH2O and a plateau pressure of 25 cmH2O.

The patient's neurological status is unchanged from admission, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15. The patient is receiving prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock due to the patient's impaired immune function and the presence of bacteria in the blood.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the patient's impaired renal function and the presence of nephrotoxic medications.
3. Respiratory failure due to the patient's impaired lung function and the presence of pneumonia.
4. Sepsis-induced cardiac arrest due to the patient's impaired cardiac function and the presence of sepsis.
5. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to the patient's immobility and the presence of risk factors such as obesity and cancer.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical condition who requires close monitoring and management in the ICU. The patient's condition is unstable, and potential medical complications can arise if not managed properly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including CAD, CHF, COPD, and a recent decannulation with subsequent fistula closure. She presented with worsened respiratory distress and was intubated due to acute respiratory failure. The patient's troponin level increased to 0.13, and her cardiac enzymes are trending downwards. She received a bolus of NS to increase her blood pressure and has been on pressors overnight.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 13.1 (normal range: 4-11.5)
* Hct: 32.3 (normal range: 37-48)
* Plt: 74 (normal range: 150-450)
* Cr: 1.3 (normal range: 0.5-1.1)
* TropT: 0.08 (normal range: <0.01)
* Glucose: 161 (normal range: 70-110)

The patient's physical examination is significant for:

* Intubated with a tracheostomy site that is healing
* Mild to moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia with episodes of penetration on nectar-thick and thin liquids
* Decreased lung sounds with rhonchi at the right base
* Distant heart sounds with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated
* Soft, non-tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds
* No edema or organomegaly noted

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Acute respiratory failure: intubated and on bronchodilators, with a plan for bronchoscopy to evaluate
* Hypotension: weaning down pressors as tolerated, with recheck of lactate and ABG
* CAD: no evidence of ischemia on ECG, with cardiac enzymes checked overnight
* CHF: pulmonary edema on CXR, with TTE showing preserved EF and some focal wall motion abnormality
* ARF: differential diagnosis includes pre-renal and ATN/AIN, with Cr decreasing from 1.3 to 1.2 overnight
* COPD: likely not the etiology of acute respiratory distress, with nebs continued
* h/o bacteremia: completing 14-day treatment with vancomycin, with monitoring for evidence of seeding
* Depression/anxiety: ativan prn for anxiety, with caution not to oversedate
* Hyperlipidemia: continuing statin
* Leukocytosis: concerning for infection, with possible sources including lungs and bacteremia

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: continued respiratory distress, possible need for tracheostomy revision or mechanical ventilation
* Cardiac complications: possible cardiac ischemia or failure, with ongoing cardiac enzymes monitoring
* Infection: possible bacterial or fungal infections, with ongoing monitoring of blood cultures and antibiotics
* Renal failure: possible worsening of ARF, with ongoing monitoring of Cr and electrolytes
* Gastrointestinal complications: possible aspiration pneumonia, with ongoing monitoring of respiratory status and bowel regimen
* Neurological complications: possible seizure or stroke, with ongoing monitoring of neurological status"

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a complex medical history. The note highlights the patient's ongoing respiratory distress, cardiac instability, and various medical interventions.

Key findings and observations:

1. Cardiac enzymes: Troponin levels increased to 0.13, then decreased to 0.08, suggesting possible cardiac ischemia, which was later ruled out due to normal EKG findings.
2. Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is labile, with a range of 61-126 mmHg systolic and 25-80 mmHg diastolic.
3. Respiratory support: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a set respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and a FiO2 of 50%.
4. Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 2,004 mL of fluids over the past 24 hours, with a negative fluid balance of -160 mL.
5. Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count has increased to 13.1 K/uL, with a platelet count of 74 K/uL. The troponin level has decreased to 0.08, and the creatinine level has increased to 1.3 mg/dL.
6. Neurological status: The patient's neurological status is not well-assessed due to the lack of data on their responsiveness, movement, tone, and reflexes.

Potential medical complications that may arise:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac enzymes were initially elevated, suggesting possible cardiac ischemia. Although the EKG findings were normal, the patient's cardiac status should be closely monitored for any signs of arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and labile blood pressure may indicate a risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and blood gases is essential.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and platelet count may indicate an underlying infection. Sepsis should be considered, and the patient should be closely monitored for signs of septic shock.
4. Renal insufficiency: The patient's increased creatinine level may indicate renal insufficiency. Close monitoring of the patient's urine output and electrolyte levels is essential.
5. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status is not well-assessed, and any signs of neurological deterioration should be promptly addressed.

In conclusion, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications. The healthcare team should continue to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory and cardiac function to ensure optimal care."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple comorbidities. The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending downwards, with troponin levels decreasing from 0.13 to 0.08 and CK levels decreasing from 60 to 39. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with a MAP in the low 50s, but responded well to a 250ml NS bolus, increasing to a MAP in the 60s and UOP to 70cc/hr.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 100% on CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring is stable, with a Tmax of 37.8°C, Tcurrent of 37.8°C, HR of 63 bpm, and BP of 91/52 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 74 K/uL. The patient's creatinine level is 1.3 mg/dL, and troponin-T level is 0.08. The patient's blood glucose level is 161 mg/dL, and lactic acid level is 1.2 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac ischemia or infarction due to the patient's troponin-T levels and EKG changes.
2. Respiratory failure or pneumonia due to the patient's respiratory distress and ventilation requirements.
3. Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's elevated white blood cell count and laboratory results.
4. Acute kidney injury or renal failure due to the patient's creatinine level and fluid balance.
5. Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia due to the patient's blood glucose level and glycemic control.
6. Bleeding or thrombosis due to the patient's thrombocytopenia and anticoagulation therapy.
7. Stress ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's critical illness and stress.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation.
9. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's immobility and risk factors.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a complicated pulmonary history, including prolonged post-operative course of intubation, pseudomonas pneumonia, tracheomalacia, and tracheocutaneous fistula. She was admitted to the ICU for take-down of the tracheocutaneous fistula and treatment of post-operative MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia.

The patient's current condition is stable, with vital signs within normal limits. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 550 mL and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 100%, and she is not requiring any vasopressors.

The patient's laboratory results show a mild elevation in troponin levels, with a peak value of 0.13 ng/mL, which is likely due to respiratory distress rather than cardiac ischemia. Her cardiac enzymes are trending downwards, and her creatinine levels are improving.

The patient's medical history is significant for multiple admissions for pneumonia and flash pulmonary edema, as well as a history of tracheomalacia and tracheocutaneous fistula. She has received IV decadron for airway swelling and has been treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam for her pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's history of recurrent pneumonia and the presence of a tracheocutaneous fistula increase her risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and the need for mechanical ventilation increase her risk of developing respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's mild elevation in troponin levels and the presence of cardiac enzymes in her blood may indicate cardiac ischemia or injury.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's history of thrombocytopenia and the presence of bleeding diathesis may increase her risk of bleeding complications.
5. Infection: The patient's history of MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia, as well as the presence of a tracheocutaneous fistula, increase her risk of developing infections.
6. Tracheomalacia: The patient's history of tracheomalacia and the presence of a tracheocutaneous fistula may increase her risk of developing tracheomalacia-related complications.
7. Tracheocutaneous fistula: The patient's history of tracheocutaneous fistula and the presence of a tracheocutaneous fistula may increase her risk of developing complications related to the fistula.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is essential to continue monitoring her vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory status closely to prevent and manage potential complications."

   67F with CAD s/p CABG, CHF, COPD and complicated pulmonary history with
   prolonged tracheostomy with recent decannulation and subsequent fistula
   closure (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) with complicated MRSA PNA
   presented with worsened respiratory distress. Patient with acute event
   of respiratory failure overnight on [**9-24**] requiring intubation with plan
   for bronchoscopy to evaluate.
   .
   <I>PLAN:</I>
   .
   <I>## Acute respiratory failure:</I>Patient intubated after acute
   respiratory failure on AM of [**9-24**]. Likely [**2-22**] mucous plugging vs
   bronchospasm in setting of possible underlying tracheal stenosis/edema
   or granulation tissue in area of prior trach. Patient still intubated
   in the case there is need for bronch or visualization of airway by
   either IP or ENT.  Given patient
s history of multiple episodes of
   respiratory distress, worrisome that patient would have future episodes
   and would benefit for visualization and possible intervention.
   - follow up with final IP and ENT recommendations
   - if no bronch or airway visualization today, can likely extubate
   patient today
   - trial patient on pressure support with SBT
   - patient has received 10 days of broad spectrum abx for staph in
   sputum from prior BAL. CXR with no evidence of infiltrate, last BCx and
   sputum unremarkable. Discontinue antibiotics today and follow fever
   curve, white count
   - touch base with speech and swallow regarding recommendations for diet
   to decrease chance of aspiration
   - continue nebs and aggressive chest PT
   .
   <I>## Hypotension:</I>Lactate decreased, has been weaned down on neo
   but unable to completely wean off while intubated and on propofol.
   Patient
s BP is fluid responsive and has been stable over last 8 hours.
   A-line attempted but unable to place, no need for monitoring currently
   - wean down neo as tolerated
   .
   <I>## CAD:</I> Patient with some troponin elevation to peak of 0.13 in
   setting of acute respiratory distress from two nights prior. Most
   recent troponin trending down at 0.08 and EKG with no acute ischemic
   changes
   -continue ASA, BB. Hold ACEI as above
   .
   <I>## CHF:</I>Patient with pulmonary edema by CXR overnight. TTE
   recently done ([**9-12**]) showed preserved EF with some focal wall motion
   abnormality. Patient euvolemic and net even overnight without any
   additional diuretics
   -Will allow patient to autodiuresis, goal net even overnight
   -monitor I/Os
   -Continue BB
   -Holding ACEI as above for ARF
   .
   <I>## ARF:</I>Ddx includes pre-renal in setting of possible infection
   vs ATN/AIN from meds given during last hospitalization and in setting
   of CTA on [**9-22**]. Cr stable at 1.2
   -hold on diuresis
   -hold lisinopril
   -renally dose abx
   -check urine lytes, eos
   .
   <I>## COPD:</I>Likely not etiology of acute respiratory distress
   overnight, patient without wheezing on exam
   -continue nebs
   .
   <I>## Depression/anxiety:</I>
   -ativan prn anxiety, caution not to oversedate
   -Continue home lamotrigine, quetiapine, sertraline
   .
   <I>## Hyperlipidemia:</I>
   -Continue statin
   .
   <I>## Leukocytosis:<I>White count decreased overnight. Concerning for
   infection although with normal diff.  Possible sources include likely
   lungs and possibly bactermia. Pt also at risk for c. diff given recent
   antibiotic use.
   -f/u blood, sputum, stool and urine cultures

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I will summarize the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Patient Condition:**

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a complex medical history, including CAD, CHF, COPD, and a prolonged tracheostomy with recent decannulation and subsequent fistula closure. She presented with worsened respiratory distress, requiring intubation, and is currently intubated in the ICU. The patient has a history of multiple episodes of respiratory distress and is at risk for future episodes.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Acute Respiratory Failure:** The patient is at risk for further respiratory failure due to her underlying pulmonary disease, tracheal stenosis/edema, or granulation tissue. Bronchoscopy may be necessary to evaluate the airway and potential interventions.
2. **Hypotension:** The patient's blood pressure is fluid responsive, and she has been weaned off vasopressors. However, she may still require monitoring and adjustments to her vasopressor therapy.
3. **CAD:** The patient has had some troponin elevation, which may indicate ongoing cardiac ischemia. She is being managed with aspirin, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors.
4. **CHF:** The patient has pulmonary edema on CXR, which may be related to her cardiac disease. She is being managed with diuretics and beta blockers.
5. **ARF:** The patient has acute kidney injury, which may be related to pre-renal causes, ATN/AIN from medications, or CTA. She is being managed with fluid restriction, diuretics, and ACE inhibitor hold.
6. **COPD:** The patient's COPD is likely not the primary cause of her acute respiratory distress. She is being managed with nebulizers and oxygen therapy.
7. **Depression/Anxiety:** The patient has a history of depression and anxiety, which may be exacerbated by her current condition. She is being managed with anxiolytics and antidepressants.
8. **Hyperlipidemia:** The patient has hyperlipidemia, which is being managed with statin therapy.
9. **Leukocytosis:** The patient has leukocytosis, which may be related to infection, bacteremia, or C. difficile colitis. She is being managed with antibiotics and further testing to determine the cause of her leukocytosis.
10. **Infection:** The patient is at risk for further infection due to her compromised immune system and recent antibiotic use.

**ICU Care:**

The patient is receiving ICU care, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and antibiotics. She is being managed with a tube feeding regimen, insulin sliding scale, and prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

   Assessment and Plan
   67yo woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG, complicated pulmonary history
   including tracheobronchiomalacia, trach / decannulation, and recent
   tracheal fistula repair (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) c/b MRSA
   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress. Her recent worsening
   appears most consistent with a multifactorial etiology:  upper airway
   procedure (fistula repair) with upper airway edema, bronchospasm/COPD,
   recent MRSA pneumonia. No problems with the surgical site.  Suspect
   mucus plug as the etiology +/- aspiration.
   1) Respiratory failure:  Acute event the other night appears to be due
   to a mucus plug, likely complicated by underlying airway pathology.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have tracheal stenosis or granulation tissue at level of prior
   trach complicating the situation.  Will discuss need for bronch or
   visualization of airway with both IP and ENT.  If neither want to scope
   her, can likely extubate today given how well she looks on current
   settings.
   - PSV 5/5, SBT
   - Has received 10 days of abx, sputum was non-purulent [**9-23**].  Will d/c
   abx and follow fever curve, WBC count.
   2) Shock:  Neo requirement decreased, appears related to propofol.
   Lactate normalized.
   -wean neo
   3) Elevated troponin:  Likely demand in setting of hypotension, now
   resolving.  No ECG changes.  Goal euvolemic.
   4) Renal: Creatinine 1.2. Follow in the setting of  CTA.
   5) F/E/N: Cardiac prudent diet. Follow / replete  lytes as needed. Goal
   euvolemic for now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchiomalacia, tracheal decannulation, and recent tracheal fistula repair, admitted with respiratory failure. She has undergone 10 days of antibiotic therapy and has received propofol for sedation. Her troponin levels have peaked at 0.13 and are now trending down. She has also had a moderate penetration of nectar thick and thin liquids on video swallow test. Her CXR shows increased interstitial markings, but no obvious infiltrate.

Assessment:

The patient's respiratory failure appears to be due to a multifactorial etiology, including upper airway procedure (fistula repair) with upper airway edema, bronchospasm/COPD, and recent MRSA pneumonia. The patient's recent worsening may be due to a mucus plug, likely complicated by underlying airway pathology.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue unless the underlying airway pathology is addressed. The patient may require bronchoscopy or visualization of the airway to identify the cause of the mucus plug.
2. Shock: The patient's shock appears to be related to propofol, and her lactate levels have normalized. Weaning the patient off propofol may be necessary to prevent further shock.
3. Elevated troponin: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, likely due to demand in the setting of hypotension. Monitoring the patient's troponin levels and adjusting her therapy accordingly may be necessary.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and monitoring her renal function is necessary. Adjusting her therapy to prevent further renal damage may be necessary.
5. Infection: The patient has received 10 days of antibiotic therapy, and her sputum culture is pending. Monitoring her for signs of infection and adjusting her antibiotic therapy accordingly may be necessary.

Plan:

1. Continue respiratory support with CPAP/PSV.
2. Wean the patient off propofol and monitor her for signs of shock.
3. Monitor the patient's troponin levels and adjust her therapy accordingly.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her therapy to prevent further renal damage.
5. Continue antibiotic therapy and monitor the patient for signs of infection.
6. Consider bronchoscopy or visualization of the airway to identify the cause of the mucus plug.
7. Consider extubation if the patient's respiratory status improves."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   67yo woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG, complicated pulmonary history
   including tracheobronchiomalacia, trach / decannulation, and recent
   tracheal fistula repair (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) c/b MRSA
   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress. Her recent worsening
   appears most consistent with a multifactorial etiology:  upper airway
   procedure (fistula repair) with upper airway edema, bronchospasm/COPD,
   recent MRSA pneumonia. No problems with the surgical site.  Suspect
   mucus plug as the etiology +/- aspiration.
   1) Respiratory failure:  Acute event the other night appears to be due
   to a mucus plug, likely complicated by underlying airway pathology.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have tracheal stenosis or granulation tissue at level of prior
   trach complicating the situation.  Will discuss need for bronch or
   visualization of airway with both IP and ENT.  If neither want to scope
   her, can likely extubate today given how well she looks on current
   settings.
   - PSV 5/5, SBT
   - Has received 10 days of abx, sputum was non-purulent [**9-23**].  Will d/c
   abx and follow fever curve, WBC count.
   2) Shock:  Neo requirement decreased, appears related to propofol.
   Lactate normalized.
   -wean neo
   3) Elevated troponin:  Likely demand in setting of hypotension, now
   resolving.  No ECG changes.  Goal euvolemic.
   4) Renal: Creatinine 1.2. Follow in the setting of  CTA.
   5) F/E/N: Cardiac prudent diet. Follow / replete  lytes as needed. Goal
   euvolemic for now.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of tracheobronchiomalacia, tracheal decannulation, and recent tracheal fistula repair. She is currently admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure.

The patient's respiratory status has been stable, with a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 99% on 50% FiO2. Her ventilator settings include CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 550 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 32 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 cmH2O.

The patient's cardiovascular status is also stable, with a heart rate of 69 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 94/48 mmHg. Her lactate level has trended down, and she has received boluses of normal saline.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, which are likely due to demand in the setting of hypotension. Her creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL, and she has received prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, complicated pulmonary history, and recent MRSA pneumonia. She has undergone tracheal fistula repair and is currently receiving antibiotics for MRSA pneumonia.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's recent worsening appears most consistent with a multifactorial etiology, including upper airway procedure (fistula repair) with upper airway edema, bronchospasm/COPD, and recent MRSA pneumonia. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a mucus plug, which may be complicated by underlying airway pathology.
2. Shock: The patient's neo requirement has decreased, and her lactate level has normalized. She may be weaned off neo soon.
3. Elevated troponin: The patient's troponin levels are likely due to demand in the setting of hypotension. No ECG changes are noted.
4. Renal: The patient's creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL, and she will be followed in the setting of CTA.
5. F/E/N: The patient will be placed on a cardiac prudent diet, and her electrolytes will be followed and repleted as needed. Goal euvolemia will be maintained.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if a mucus plug is not removed or if underlying airway pathology is not addressed.
2. Shock: The patient's shock may worsen if her neo requirement is not weaned off or if her lactate level is not normalized.
3. Elevated troponin: The patient's elevated troponin levels may indicate cardiac injury, which may worsen if not addressed.
4. Renal: The patient's creatinine level may worsen if her renal function is not monitored and managed properly.
5. F/E/N: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may worsen if not managed properly, leading to cardiac arrhythmias or other complications.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   67yo woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG, complicated pulmonary history
   including tracheobronchiomalacia, trach / decannulation, and recent
   tracheal fistula repair (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) c/b MRSA
   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress. Her recent worsening
   appears most consistent with a multifactorial etiology:  upper airway
   procedure (fistula repair) with upper airway edema, bronchospasm/COPD,
   recent MRSA pneumonia. No problems with the surgical site.  Suspect
   mucus plug as the etiology +/- aspiration.
   1) Respiratory failure:  Acute event the other night appears to be due
   to a mucus plug, likely complicated by underlying airway pathology.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have tracheal stenosis or granulation tissue at level of prior
   trach complicating the situation.  Will discuss need for bronch or
   visualization of airway with both IP and ENT.  If neither want to scope
   her, can likely extubate today given how well she looks on current
   settings.
   - PSV 5/5, SBT
   - Has received 10 days of abx, sputum was non-purulent [**9-23**].  Will d/c
   abx and follow fever curve, WBC count.
   2) Shock:  Neo requirement decreased, appears related to propofol.
   Lactate normalized.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of tracheobronchiomalacia, tracheal decannulation, and recent tracheal fistula repair. She was admitted with respiratory failure and has been experiencing worsening respiratory distress, likely due to a multifactorial etiology including upper airway edema, bronchospasm/COPD, and recent MRSA pneumonia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: She is on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a Vt of 550 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%.
* Cardiovascular: Her blood pressure is 94/48 mmHg, and she has a troponin level of 0.13 ng/mL, which is likely due to demand in the setting of hypotension.
* Renal: Her creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL, and she has a normal lactate level.
* Neurological: She is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may require further interventions such as bronchoscopy or tracheostomy to manage her airway.
* Shock: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she may require further fluid resuscitation or vasopressors to maintain adequate perfusion.
* Elevated troponin: The patient's troponin level is elevated, which may indicate myocardial injury or infarction.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate renal impairment or failure.
* Neurological: The patient's neurological status is critical, and she may require further monitoring and interventions to manage her neurological function.

In terms of the plan, the patient will continue to receive respiratory support, and her airway will be monitored closely. She will also receive further fluid resuscitation and vasopressors as needed to maintain adequate perfusion. The patient's troponin level will be monitored closely, and she will receive further cardiac monitoring to rule out myocardial infarction. The patient's creatinine level will be monitored closely, and she will receive further renal monitoring to rule out renal impairment or failure. The patient's neurological status will be monitored closely, and she will receive further interventions as needed to manage her neurological function."

   Assessment and Plan
   67F with CAD s/p CABG, CHF, COPD and complicated pulmonary history with
   prolonged tracheostomy with recent decannulation and subsequent fistula
   closure (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) with complicated MRSA PNA
   presented with worsened respiratory distress. Patient with acute event
   of respiratory failure overnight on [**9-24**] requiring intubation with plan
   for bronchoscopy to evaluate.
   .
   <I>PLAN:</I>
   .
   <I>## Acute respiratory failure:</I>Patient intubated after acute
   respiratory failure on AM of [**9-24**]. Likely [**2-22**] mucous plugging vs
   bronchospasm in setting of possible underlying tracheal stenosis/edema
   or granulation tissue in area of prior trach. Patient still intubated
   in the case there is need for bronch or visualization of airway by
   either IP or ENT.  Given patient
s history of multiple episodes of
   respiratory distress, worrisome that patient would have future episodes
   and would benefit for visualization and possible intervention.
   - follow up with final IP and ENT recommendations
   - if no bronch or airway visualization today, can likely extubate
   patient today
   - trial patient on pressure support with SBT
   - patient has received 10 days of broad spectrum abx for staph in
   sputum from prior BAL. CXR with no evidence of infiltrate, last BCx and
   sputum unremarkable. Discontinue antibiotics today and follow fever
   curve, white count
   - touch base with speech and swallow regarding recommendations for diet
   to decrease chance of aspiration
   - continue nebs and aggressive chest PT
   .
   <I>## Hypotension:</I>Lactate decreased, has been weaned down on neo
   but unable to completely wean off while intubated and on propofol.
   Patient
s BP is fluid responsive and has been stable over last 8 hours.
   A-line attempted but unable to place, no need for monitoring currently
   - wean down neo as tolerated
   .
   <I>## CAD:</I> Patient with some troponin elevation to peak of 0.13 in
   setting of acute respiratory distress from two nights prior. Most
   recent troponin trending down at 0.08 and EKG with no acute ischemic
   changes
   -continue ASA, BB. Hold ACEI as above
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   67F with CAD s/p CABG, CHF, COPD and complicated pulmonary history with
   prolonged tracheostomy with recent decannulation and subsequent fistula
   closure (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) with complicated MRSA PNA
   presented with worsened respiratory distress. Patient with acute event
   of respiratory failure overnight on [**9-24**] requiring intubation with plan
   for bronchoscopy to evaluate.

   <I>## Acute respiratory failure:</I>Patient intubated after acute
   respiratory failure on AM of [**9-24**]. Likely [**2-22**] mucous plugging vs
   bronchospasm in setting of possible underlying tracheal stenosis/edema
   or granulation tissue in area of prior trach. Patient still intubated
   in the case there is need for bronch or visualization of airway by
   either IP or ENT.  Given patient
s history of multiple episodes of
   respiratory distress, worrisome that patient would have future episodes
   and would benefit for visualization and possible intervention.
   - follow up with final IP and ENT recommendations
   - if no bronch or airway visualization today, can likely extubate
   patient today
   - trial patient on pressure support with SBT
   - patient has received 10 days of broad spectrum abx for staph in
   sputum from prior BAL. CXR with no evidence of infiltrate, last BCx and
   sputum unremarkable. Discontinue antibiotics today and follow fever
   curve, white count
   - touch base with speech and swallow regarding recommendations for diet
   to decrease chance of aspiration
   - continue nebs and aggressive chest PT
   .
   <I>## Hypotension:</I>Lactate decreased, has been weaned down on neo
   but unable to completely wean off while intubated and on propofol.
   Patient
s BP is fluid responsive and has been stable over last 8 hours.
   A-line attempted but unable to place, no need for monitoring currently
   - wean down neo as tolerated
   .
   <I>## CAD:</I> Patient with some troponin elevation to peak of 0.13 in
   setting of acute respiratory distress from two nights prior. Most
   recent troponin trending down at 0.08 and EKG with no acute ischemic
   changes

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and complicated pulmonary history. She was recently decannulated and had a fistula closure, and presented with worsened respiratory distress requiring intubation.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.8°C (100.1°F)
* Heart rate: 58 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 123/57 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* SpO2: 97%

The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The respiratory support is set to MMV/PSV/AutoFlow mode.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 13.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 423 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
* Troponin: 0.08 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.8 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* Acute respiratory failure: likely due to mucous plugging, bronchospasm, or tracheal stenosis/edema
* Hypotension: patient is fluid responsive and has been stable over the last 8 hours
* CAD: patient has troponin elevation, but EKG shows no acute ischemic changes
* CHF: patient has pulmonary edema, but euvolemic and net even overnight
* ARF: patient's creatinine is stable, and the differential diagnosis includes pre-renal azotemia, acute tubular necrosis/acute interstitial nephritis, and contrast-induced acute kidney injury
* COPD: patient's respiratory distress is not likely due to COPD
* Leukocytosis: patient's white blood cell count is elevated, but the differential count is normal
* Infection: patient is at risk for infection, particularly in the lungs and possibly bacteremia
* C. difficile infection: patient is at risk due to recent antibiotic use

The patient's plan includes:

* Discontinuing antibiotics and following a fever curve and white blood cell count
* Trial of pressure support with spontaneous breathing trial (SBT)
* Weaning down from propofol and neo
* Continuing nebulizers and aggressive chest physical therapy
* Following up with speech and swallow regarding recommendations for diet to decrease the risk of aspiration
* Monitoring I/Os and net even overnight
* Holding ACEI and lisinopril
* Renally dosing antibiotics
* Checking urine lytes and eos
* Continuing statin therapy
* Monitoring for signs of infection, including fever, chills, and increased white blood cell count."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with recurrent respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. Antibiotics were discontinued, and the patient's home Lasix regimen was restarted. A rigid bronchoscopy was performed with normal findings. The patient's vital signs remain stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, and blood pressure of 123/57 mmHg. The patient is receiving various medications, including phenylephrine, propofol, and pantoprazole. The patient's laboratory results show mild thrombocytopenia, anemia, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with mechanical ventilation, and the patient is receiving supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's recurrent respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in lung function, requiring increased respiratory support or invasive mechanical ventilation.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's mild thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly with invasive procedures or anticoagulation therapy.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may contribute to fatigue, decreased oxygen delivery, and increased risk of cardiovascular complications.
4. Lactic acidosis: The patient's elevated lactate levels may indicate inadequate tissue perfusion, potentially leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
5. Infection: The patient's discontinued antibiotics and lack of clear infection diagnosis may leave them at risk for developing secondary infections.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis and elevated lactate levels may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels may contribute to cardiovascular instability, potentially leading to hypotension, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and limited oral intake may lead to malnutrition, potentially exacerbating underlying conditions or delaying recovery.
9. Worsening of underlying disease: The patient's underlying condition may worsen over time, potentially leading to further organ dysfunction or failure.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition, adjust therapy as needed, and consider further diagnostic testing to identify and address potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   In Summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 67F with CAD s/p CABG, CHF, COPD and
   complicated pulmonary history with prolonged tracheostomy with recent
   decannulation and subsequent fistula closure (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**]
   on [**9-12**]) with complicated MRSA PNA presented with worsened respiratory
   distress.  Now s/p bronchoscopy which did not reveal significant upper
   airway stenosis.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated on [**9-24**] after episode of
   flash pulmonary edema while being bathed and concern for upper airway
   obstruction due to previous intubations/trach.  Patient also has
   history of trace aspiration.  Copmleted 10 day course for aspiration
   pneumonia on [**9-25**]. Anxiety also contributes to patient
s respiratory
   distress. Bronchoscopy on [**9-25**] showed no significant upper airway
   stenosis.  Will need permanent trach if extubation is unsuccessful
   today.
   - extubate today
   - continue nebs
   - continue home lasix for interstial edema
   - ativan prn
   - transition to PO meds if successfully extubated
   .
   2.       Hypotension.  Patient required pressors while on propofol for
   sedation. Will wean neo and extubate today.  Hopeful that patient will
   not require pressors when not on sedation.
   3.   CAD.  Patient had troponin leak in setting of flash pulmonary
   edema/HTN.  Troponins have trended down.
   -continue ASA, BB
   - consider resuming ACEI tomorrow if hemodynamically stable
   .
   4.  CHF.  Patient had episode of pulmonary edema requiring intubation
   on [**9-23**].  CXR yesterday showed mild interstitial edema.  Currently
   euvolemic, but will continue home lasix dose.   TTE recently done
   ([**9-12**]) showed preserved EF with some focal wall motion abnormality.
   Patient euvolemic and net even overnight without any additional
   diuretics
   -continue home lasix
   -monitor I/Os
   -Continue BB
   - holding ACEI until blood pressure stable for 24 hours off pressors
   .
   5.  ARF.  Pre-renal ARF is resolved now.  Cr now 1.0.
   - consider resuming lisinopril in AM
   6.   COPD.
    -continue nebs
   .
   7. Depression/anxiety.  Patient has significant anxiety.
   -ativan prn anxiety, caution not to oversedate
   -Continue home lamotrigine, quetiapine, sertraline
   .
   8.  Hyperlipidemia:
   -Continue statin

   Assessment and Plan
   In Summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 67F with CAD s/p CABG, CHF, COPD and
   complicated pulmonary history with prolonged tracheostomy with recent
   decannulation and subsequent fistula closure (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**]
   on [**9-12**]) with complicated MRSA PNA presented with worsened respiratory
   distress.  Now s/p bronchoscopy which did not reveal significant upper
   airway stenosis.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated on [**9-24**] after episode of
   flash pulmonary edema while being bathed and concern for upper airway
   obstruction due to previous intubations/trach.  Patient also has
   history of trace aspiration.  Copmleted 10 day course for aspiration
   pneumonia on [**9-25**]. Anxiety also contributes to patient
s respiratory
   distress. Bronchoscopy on [**9-25**] showed no significant upper airway
   stenosis.  Will need permanent trach if extubation is unsuccessful
   today.
   - extubate today
   - continue nebs
   - continue home lasix for interstial edema
   - ativan prn
   - transition to PO meds if successfully extubated
   .
   2.       Hypotension.  Patient required pressors while on propofol for
   sedation. Will wean neo and extubate today.  Hopeful that patient will
   not require pressors when not on sedation.
   3.   CAD.  Patient had troponin leak in setting of flash pulmonary
   edema/HTN.  Troponins have trended down.
   -continue ASA, BB
   - consider resuming ACEI tomorrow if hemodynamically stable
   .
   4.  CHF.  Patient had episode of pulmonary edema requiring intubation
   on [**9-23**].  CXR yesterday showed mild interstitial edema.  Currently
   euvolemic, but will continue home lasix dose.   TTE recently done
   ([**9-12**]) showed preserved EF with some focal wall motion abnormality.
   Patient euvolemic and net even overnight without any additional
   diuretics
   -continue home lasix
   -monitor I/Os
   -Continue BB
   - holding ACEI until blood pressure stable for 24 hours off pressors
   .
   5.  ARF.  Pre-renal ARF is resolved now.  Cr now 1.0.
   - consider resuming lisinopril in AM
   6.   COPD.
    -continue nebs
   .
   7. Depression/anxiety.  Patient has significant anxiety.
   -ativan prn anxiety, caution not to oversedate
   -Continue home lamotrigine, quetiapine, sertraline
   .
   8.  Hyperlipidemia:
   -Continue statin

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient, a 67-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, COPD, and complicated pulmonary history, was admitted to the ICU with worsening respiratory distress. She was intubated after an episode of flash pulmonary edema and concern for upper airway obstruction. The patient has a history of trace aspiration and completed a 10-day course of antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia. She has also been experiencing anxiety, which contributes to her respiratory distress. A bronchoscopy was performed, which did not reveal significant upper airway stenosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and extubation may be unsuccessful. Permanent tracheostomy may be necessary if extubation is unsuccessful.
2. Hypotension: The patient has required pressors while on propofol for sedation, and weaning from the pressors may be challenging. The patient's blood pressure may not be stable for 24 hours off pressors, which may delay the resumption of ACEI.
3. CAD: The patient had a troponin leak in the setting of flash pulmonary edema and hypertension. Troponins have trended down, but the patient may still be at risk for further cardiac complications.
4. CHF: The patient had an episode of pulmonary edema requiring intubation and has a history of CHF. The patient's euvolemia may be at risk, and further diuretic therapy may be necessary.
5. ARF: The patient's pre-renal ARF has resolved, but the patient may still be at risk for further renal complications.
6. COPD: The patient's COPD may exacerbate her respiratory distress, and further therapy may be necessary to manage her symptoms.
7. Depression/Anxiety: The patient has significant anxiety and may require further therapy to manage her symptoms.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may contribute to her cardiovascular risk and may require further therapy.

ICU Care:

The patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU. Her respiratory status, cardiac function, and renal function need to be closely monitored. The patient's nutrition and glycemic control also need to be managed. Prophylactic measures such as DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prophylaxis should be continued. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU care for now."

   Assessment and Plan
   67yo woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG, complicated pulmonary history
   including tracheobronchiomalacia, trach / decannulation, and recent
   tracheal fistula repair (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) c/b MRSA
   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress. Her recent worsening
   appears most consistent with a multifactorial etiology:  upper airway
   procedure (fistula repair) with upper airway edema, bronchospasm/COPD,
   recent MRSA pneumonia. No problems with the surgical site.  Suspect
   mucus plug as the etiology +/- aspiration.
   1) Respiratory failure:  Acute event the other night appears to be due
   to a mucus plug vs aspiration.  No airway pathology seen on rigid
   bronch which would limit extubation.
   - good RSBI this AM, comfortable on [**5-26**], so will proceed with
   extubation.
   - no evidence of pneumonia, off antibiotics
   2) Hypotension:  Resolved.  off neo.  Likely related to propofol.
   3) Elevated troponin/Hx CHF:  Likely demand in setting of hypotension,
   now resolving.  No ECG changes.  Goal euvolemic.  Restart
   antihypertensives in AM if stable today.
   4) ARF:  Resolved.  Creatinine improved.
   5) F/E/N: NPO, restart clear liquids tonight if she does well. Follow /
   replete  lytes as needed. Goal euvolemic for now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best.

   mucus plug as the etiology +/- aspiration.
   1) Respiratory failure:  Acute event the other night appears to be due
   to a mucus plug vs aspiration.  No airway pathology seen on rigid
   bronch which would limit extubation.
   - good RSBI this AM, comfortable on [**5-26**], so will proceed with
   extubation.
   - no evidence of pneumonia, off antibiotics
   2) Hypotension:  Resolved.  off neo.  Likely related to propofol.
   3) Elevated troponin/Hx CHF:  Likely demand in setting of hypotension,
   now resolving.  No ECG changes.  Goal euvolemic.  Restart
   antihypertensives in AM if stable today.
   4) ARF:  Resolved.  Creatinine improved.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of CAD and recent tracheal fistula repair due to MRSA pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure and has undergone several procedures, including a rigid bronchoscopy and reintubation.

The patient's recent worsening appears to be multifactorial, with upper airway edema, bronchospasm/COPD, and recent MRSA pneumonia contributing to her respiratory distress. The patient's recent events include a 24-hour period of respiratory failure, which was attributed to a mucus plug or aspiration. The patient's RSBI has improved, and she is comfortable on CPAP/PSV.

The patient's lab results show elevated troponin levels, which are likely due to demand in the setting of hypotension, now resolving. Her creatinine levels have improved, and she is no longer in acute renal failure. Her electrolyte levels are stable, and she is receiving prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

The patient's plan includes extubation, which will be attempted if she remains comfortable and her RSBI remains good. She will be restarted on clear liquids tonight if she does well, and her electrolyte levels will be followed and repleted as needed. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if she is not extubated successfully or if she develops further respiratory complications.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's recent MRSA pneumonia can recur or develop further complications, such as abscesses or empyema.
3. Tracheal stenosis: The patient's recent tracheal fistula repair and reintubation can lead to tracheal stenosis, which can cause respiratory distress.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and recent troponin elevation can increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
5. Renal complications: The patient's recent acute renal failure can lead to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease if not properly managed.
6. Infection: The patient's recent MRSA pneumonia and reintubation can increase her risk of developing further infections, such as sepsis or septic shock.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's recent hypotension and respiratory failure can lead to neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.

It is essential to monitor the patient closely and manage her condition aggressively to prevent these potential complications and ensure her optimal recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best.

Chief Complaint: respiratory failure
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Fellow for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   67yo woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG, complicated pulmonary history
   including tracheobronchiomalacia, trach / decannulation, and recent
   tracheal fistula repair (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) c/b MRSA
   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress. Her recent worsening
   appears most consistent with a multifactorial etiology:  upper airway
   procedure (fistula repair) with upper airway edema, bronchospasm/COPD,
   recent MRSA pneumonia.

   including tracheobronchiomalacia, trach / decannulation, and recent
   tracheal fistula repair (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) c/b MRSA
   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress. Her recent worsening
   appears most consistent with a multifactorial etiology:  upper airway
   procedure (fistula repair) with upper airway edema, bronchospasm/COPD,
   recent MRSA pneumonia. No problems with the surgical site.  Suspect
   mucus plug as the etiology +/- aspiration.
   1) Respiratory failure:  Acute event the other night appears to be due
   to a mucus plug vs aspiration.  No airway pathology seen on rigid
   bronch which would limit extubation.
   - good RSBI this AM, comfortable on [**5-26**], so will proceed with
   extubation.
   - no evidence of pneumonia, off antibiotics
   2) Hypotension:  Resolved.  off neo.  Likely related to propofol.
   3) Elevated troponin/Hx CHF:  Likely demand in setting of hypotension,
   now resolving.  No ECG changes.  Goal euvolemic.  Restart
   antihypertensives in AM if stable today.
   4) ARF:  Resolved.  Creatinine improved.
   5) F/E/N: NPO, restart clear liquids tonight if she does well. Follow /
   replete  lytes as needed. Goal euvolemic for now.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and complicated pulmonary history, including tracheobronchiomalacia, tracheal decannulation, and recent tracheal fistula repair. She presented with respiratory failure, MRSA pneumonia, and respiratory distress.

The patient's recent worsening appears to be multifactorial, including upper airway procedure-related upper airway edema, bronchospasm/COPD, and recent MRSA pneumonia. The rigid bronchoscopy was reportedly normal, and the patient was extubated in the operating room but became hypoxic due to sedation and was reintubated.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.4°C (99.3°F)
* Heart rate: 86 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 127/73 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Well-nourished appearance
* Normocephalic head
* Tracheal site healing well
* Clear breath sounds
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* Warm skin
* Attentive and follows simple commands

Laboratory results include:

* Hemoglobin: 9.1 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 13.1 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count: 423 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.03 ng/mL
* Glucose: 70 mg/dL

Imaging studies show bilateral lower lobe infiltrates on chest X-ray, which are minimal.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's recent worsening appears to be due to a multifactorial etiology, including upper airway procedure-related upper airway edema, bronchospasm/COPD, and recent MRSA pneumonia. The plan is to proceed with extubation.
* Hypotension: Resolved, likely related to propofol.
* Elevated troponin/Hx CHF: Likely demand in setting of hypotension, now resolving. The goal is to achieve euvolemia.
* ARF: Resolved, creatinine improved.
* F/E/N: NPO, restart clear liquids tonight if the patient does well. Follow and replete electrolytes as needed, with a goal of euvolemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate due to underlying pulmonary disease, pneumonia, or other factors.
* Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her recent surgery and prolonged hospitalization.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and recent hypotension may increase her risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
* Neurological complications: The patient's recent hypotension and respiratory failure may increase her risk for neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's prolonged NPO status and recent surgery may increase her risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or bowel obstruction."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour post-extubation, requiring advancement of their diet due to hunger. They have been experiencing asymptomatic hypotension, which resolved without intervention.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 79 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 121/55 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy via a CPAP mask and have a SpO2 of 93%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 13.1
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 10.5 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 369 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.03 ng/mL
* Glucose: 87 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.3/30.1/1.2, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 39/6/0.08, Differential-Neuts: 89.8%, Band: 0.0%, Lymph: 6.9%, Mono: 2.4%, Eos: 0.7%, Lactic Acid: 1.2 mmol/L, Ca++: 9.1 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL, PO4: 3.2 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is incomplete due to lack of assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Hypotension: Reoccurrence or worsening of hypotension could lead to decreased organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
* Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to the presence of invasive lines, including the PICC line.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
* Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulceration due to their critical illness and potential for acidosis.
* DVT: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and potential for hypercoagulability.
* VAP: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to their recent intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation.

The patient's plan includes advancement of their diet, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 67F with CAD s/p CABG, CHF, COPD and complicated
   pulmonary history with prolonged tracheostomy with recent decannulation
   and subsequent fistula closure (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) with
   complicated MRSA PNA presented with worsened respiratory distress.  Now
   s/p bronchoscopy which did not reveal significant upper airway
   stenosis.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated on [**9-24**] after episode of
   flash pulmonary edema while being bathed and concern for upper airway
   obstruction due to previous intubations/trach.  Patient also has
   history of trace aspiration.  Completed 10 day course for aspiration
   pneumonia on [**9-25**]. Rigid bronchoscopy on [**9-25**] showed no significant upper
   airway stenosis.  Extubated successfully on [**2138-9-26**]. No episodes of
   respiratory distress overnight, but given history, will watch closely
   today as patient is advanced on her diet with aspiration precautions.
   - IP and ENT following, appreciate recs
   - watch patient closely overnight as we advance her diet today
   - strict aspiration precautions with PO intake
 regular food with thin
   liquids with aspiration precautions, but pills must be taken with
   thickened liquids
   - continue nebs
   - continue home lasix for interstial edema
   - ativan prn for anxiety
   .
   2.Hypotension.  Patient off pressors, still with some low BP overnight,
   but asymptomatic
   - monitor BP and fluid boluses prn
   3.   CAD.  Patient had troponin leak in setting of flash pulmonary
   edema/HTN.  Troponins have trended down.
   -continue ASA, BB
   - consider resuming ACEI when BP tolerates and if renal function
   continues to improve
   .
   4.  CHF.  Patient had episode of pulmonary edema requiring intubation
   on [**9-23**].  CXR yesterday showed mild interstitial edema.  Currently
   euvolemic, but will continue home lasix dose.   TTE recently done
   ([**9-12**]) showed preserved EF with some focal wall motion abnormality.
   Patient euvolemic and net even overnight without any additional
   diuretics
   -continue home lasix
   -monitor I/Os
   -Continue BB
   - holding ACEI until blood pressure stable
   .
   5.  ARF.  Pre-renal ARF is resolved now.  Cr now 1.0.
   - consider resuming lisinopril when BP tolerates, Cr improved
   6.   COPD.
    -continue nebs
   .
   7. Depression/anxiety.  Patient has significant anxiety.
   -ativan prn anxiety, caution not to oversedate. Can change Ativan from
   IV to PO
   -Continue home lamotrigine, quetiapine, sertraline
   .
   8.  Hyperlipidemia:
   -Continue statin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   flash pulmonary edema while being bathed and concern for upper airway
   obstruction due to previous intubations/trach.  Patient also has
   history of trace aspiration.  Completed 10 day course for aspiration
   pneumonia on [**9-25**]. Rigid bronchoscopy on [**9-25**] showed no significant upper
   airway stenosis.  Extubated successfully on [**2138-9-26**]. No episodes of
   respiratory distress overnight, but given history, will watch closely
   today as patient is advanced on her diet with aspiration precautions.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a recent prolonged tracheostomy with fistula closure. She was admitted with respiratory distress and was intubated after an episode of flash pulmonary edema. She underwent bronchoscopy, which did not reveal significant upper airway stenosis. She was successfully extubated and is currently on CPAP mask. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 121/55 mmHg and a heart rate of 79 bpm. Her laboratory results show normal renal function, with a creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of respiratory distress and prolonged tracheostomy with fistula closure increases her risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring is necessary, especially as she is advanced on her diet with aspiration precautions.
2. Hypotension: The patient's asymptomatic hypotension overnight may indicate underlying cardiovascular instability. Monitoring of blood pressure and fluid boluses as needed is necessary.
3. CAD: The patient's troponin leak in the setting of flash pulmonary edema/HTN suggests ongoing cardiac instability. Close monitoring of cardiac enzymes and consideration of resuming ACEI when blood pressure is stable are necessary.
4. CHF: The patient's recent episode of pulmonary edema requiring intubation and mild interstitial edema on CXR suggest ongoing cardiac instability. Close monitoring of I/Os and continued home lasix dose are necessary.
5. ARF: The patient's pre-renal ARF is resolved, but close monitoring of renal function is necessary to prevent recurrence.
6. COPD: The patient's history of COPD and recent respiratory distress increase her risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory status and continued nebs are necessary.
7. Depression/anxiety: The patient's significant anxiety and history of depression increase her risk of psychological complications. Close monitoring of mental status and continued medication are necessary.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's history of hyperlipidemia increases her risk of cardiovascular complications. Close monitoring of lipid levels and continued statin therapy are necessary.

ICU Care Plan:

1. Nutrition: Advance diet to regular diet with aspiration precautions, pills with thickened liquids.
2. Glycemic Control: Continue to monitor and control blood glucose levels.
3. Lines: Continue to monitor and maintain patency of RIC and PICC lines.
4. Prophylaxis: Continue DVT prophylaxis with boots and stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole.
5. VAP: Continue to monitor for VAP and take necessary precautions.
6. Medications: Continue all medications as prescribed, including antibiotics, antihypertensives, and anti-anxiety medications.
7. Monitoring: Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and mental status closely."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including CAD, CHF, COPD, and complicated pulmonary history. She was recently decannulated and had a prolonged tracheostomy with subsequent fistula closure. She was intubated due to respiratory distress and underwent bronchoscopy, which did not reveal significant upper airway stenosis. She was extubated successfully and is currently being monitored closely for respiratory distress. She has a history of hypotension, which has resolved without intervention. She also has a history of CAD, CHF, and ARF, which are being managed with medication and fluid management. She has depression and anxiety, which are being treated with medication. She has a history of hyperlipidemia, which is being managed with a statin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of respiratory distress and prolonged tracheostomy increases her risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring and early intervention are necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypotension increases her risk of further hypotension, particularly if she becomes dehydrated or has a sudden drop in blood pressure.
3. CAD: The patient's history of CAD increases her risk of myocardial infarction or unstable angina, particularly if she experiences further stress or has a sudden change in her cardiac status.
4. CHF: The patient's history of CHF increases her risk of further decompensation, particularly if she experiences further fluid overload or has a sudden change in her cardiac status.
5. ARF: The patient's history of ARF increases her risk of further kidney damage or failure, particularly if she experiences further fluid overload or has a sudden change in her kidney function.
6. Depression and anxiety: The patient's history of depression and anxiety increases her risk of further mental health deterioration, particularly if she experiences further stress or has a sudden change in her mental status.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's history of hyperlipidemia increases her risk of further cardiovascular events, particularly if she does not adhere to her statin medication regimen.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   In Summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 67F with CAD s/p CABG, CHF, COPD and
   complicated pulmonary history with prolonged tracheostomy with recent
   decannulation and subsequent fistula closure (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**]
   on [**9-12**]) with complicated MRSA PNA presented with worsened respiratory
   distress.  Now s/p bronchoscopy which did not reveal significant upper
   airway stenosis.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated on [**9-24**] after episode of
   flash pulmonary edema while being bathed and concern for upper airway
   obstruction due to previous intubations/trach.  Patient also has
   history of trace aspiration.  Copmleted 10 day course for aspiration
   pneumonia on [**9-25**]. Anxiety also contributes to patient
s respiratory
   distress. Bronchoscopy on [**9-25**] showed no significant upper airway
   stenosis.  Will need permanent trach if extubation is unsuccessful
   today.
   - extubate today
   - continue nebs
   - continue home lasix for interstial edema
   - ativan prn
   - transition to PO meds if successfully extubated
   .
   2.       Hypotension.  Patient required pressors while on propofol for
   sedation. Will wean neo and extubate today.  Hopeful that patient will
   not require pressors when not on sedation.
   3.   CAD.  Patient had troponin leak in setting of flash pulmonary
   edema/HTN.  Troponins have trended down.
   -continue ASA, BB
   - consider resuming ACEI tomorrow if hemodynamically stable
   .
   4.  CHF.  Patient had episode of pulmonary edema requiring intubation
   on [**9-23**].  CXR yesterday showed mild interstitial edema.  Currently
   euvolemic, but will continue home lasix dose.   TTE recently done
   ([**9-12**]) showed preserved EF with some focal wall motion abnormality.
   Patient euvolemic and net even overnight without any additional
   diuretics
   -continue home lasix
   -monitor I/Os
   -Continue BB
   - holding ACEI until blood pressure stable for 24 hours off pressors
   .
   5.  ARF.  Pre-renal ARF is resolved now.  Cr now 1.0.
   - consider resuming lisinopril in AM
   6.   COPD.
    -continue nebs
   .
   7. Depression/anxiety.  Patient has significant anxiety.
   -ativan prn anxiety, caution not to oversedate
   -Continue home lamotrigine, quetiapine, sertraline
   .
   8.  Hyperlipidemia:
   -Continue statin

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's current condition and potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

The patient, a 67-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, COPD, and complicated pulmonary history, was intubated on 9/24 due to flash pulmonary edema and concern for upper airway obstruction. She has since completed a 10-day course of antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been extubated and is currently on CPAP mask with a SpO2 of 93%. She has asymptomatic hypotension and requires advancement of her diet.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory distress is a concern, and she may require permanent tracheostomy if extubation is unsuccessful.
2. **Hypotension:** The patient has required pressors while on propofol for sedation and may require further management to maintain stable blood pressure.
3. **CAD:** The patient has had a troponin leak in the setting of flash pulmonary edema/HTN, and her troponins have trended down. She is currently on ASA and BB and may resume ACEI tomorrow if hemodynamically stable.
4. **CHF:** The patient has had an episode of pulmonary edema requiring intubation and has mild interstitial edema on CXR. She is currently euvolemic but will continue home lasix dose.
5. **ARF:** The patient's pre-renal ARF has resolved, and her Cr has decreased to 1.0. She may resume lisinopril in the morning.
6. **COPD:** The patient's COPD is a chronic condition that may require continued management with nebs.
7. **Depression/Anxiety:** The patient has significant anxiety and may require continued management with Ativan prn and home medications.
8. **Hyperlipidemia:** The patient's hyperlipidemia is a chronic condition that may require continued management with a statin.

**ICU Care:**

The patient requires continued ICU care for now, with attention to her respiratory status, blood pressure, and fluid management. She will require close monitoring of her I/Os, blood pressure, and electrolytes."

   including tracheobronchiomalacia, trach / decannulation, and recent
   tracheal fistula repair (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) c/b MRSA
   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress.  Suspect mucus plug as
   the etiology +/- aspiration.  Now much improved, s/p extubation
   yesterday.
   1) Respiratory failure:  Acute event the other night appears to be due
   to a mucus plug vs aspiration.  No airway pathology seen on rigid
   bronch.
   - aspiration precautions
   - no evidence of pneumonia, off antibiotics
   - standing inhalers
   - CPAP prn per home regimen
   - appreciate ENT & IP input
   2) Elevated troponin/Hx CHF:  Likely demand in setting of hypotension,
   now resolving.  No ECG changes.
   - on home dose of lasix
   - hold anithypertensives given bp 80s/40s overnight
   3) F/E/N: Diet per speech/swallow recommendations.
   4) Anxiety:  ativan prn (home regimen.)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and a complicated pulmonary history, including tracheobronchiomalacia, tracheal decannulation, and recent tracheal fistula repair. She was admitted with respiratory failure and MRSA pneumonia. She was intubated and received invasive ventilation, but was extubated yesterday. She was on CPAP per her request, which she uses at home. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, and blood pressure of 122/48 mmHg. She has a history of hypotension, with a low blood pressure of 80s/40s overnight, but it resolved without intervention.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is improving, but she is at risk for aspiration and mucus plug formation due to her tracheobronchiomalacia.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels suggest cardiac damage, which may be related to hypotension or demand in the setting of CAD.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of tracheal fistula repair and recent antibiotics may increase her risk for gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
4. Infection: The patient's MRSA pneumonia has resolved, but she is still at risk for secondary infections, particularly given her compromised immune system.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of tracheal decannulation and recent tracheal fistula repair may increase her risk for neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CAD and recent cardiac surgery may increase her risk for cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
7. Hematological complications: The patient's history of thrombocytopenia and recent antibiotics may increase her risk for hematological complications, such as bleeding or thrombosis.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's respiratory failure is improving, but she requires continued monitoring and management. She should be kept on CPAP per her request, and her respiratory status should be closely monitored. The patient's cardiac status should be closely monitored, and she should be started on home dose of lasix. She should also be held on antihypertensives given her low blood pressure overnight. The patient should be continued on prophylactic antibiotics and antifungal agents, and her wound should be closely monitored for signs of infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress.  Suspect mucus plug as
   the etiology +/- aspiration.  Now much improved, s/p extubation
   yesterday.
   1) Respiratory failure:  Acute event the other night appears to be due
   to a mucus plug with aspiration in RLL.  No airway pathology seen on
   rigid bronch.
   - aspiration precautions
   - no evidence of pneumonia, off antibiotics
   - standing inhalers

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and complicated pulmonary history, including tracheobronchiomalacia, tracheal decannulation, and recent tracheal fistula repair. She was admitted with respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia and presented with respiratory distress. She was extubated yesterday and is now on CPAP per her home regimen. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure as low as 80s/40s, which has resolved without intervention. Her laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, likely due to demand in the setting of hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she is at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying pulmonary history and the potential for mucus plugs or aspiration.
2. Pneumonia: Although the patient's pneumonia appears to be resolving, she is still at risk for developing pneumonia due to her compromised respiratory status and the presence of MRSA.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels suggest cardiac stress, which may be related to her hypotensive episode. She is at risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 10.5 g/dL, which is below the normal range. She may be at risk for anemia, which could exacerbate her respiratory and cardiac status.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 369 K/uL, which is below the normal range. She may be at risk for bleeding complications.
6. Infection: The patient's recent tracheal fistula repair and presence of MRSA pneumonia make her at risk for infection.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's history of CAD and complicated pulmonary history may put her at risk for malnutrition, which could exacerbate her respiratory and cardiac status.
8. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety may be exacerbated by her respiratory and cardiac status, and may require further management.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and provide oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Consider administering antibiotics to prevent pneumonia.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and consider administering medications to manage cardiac stress.
4. Consider transfusing blood products to correct the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia.
5. Implement infection prevention measures to prevent infection.
6. Provide nutrition support to prevent malnutrition.
7. Manage the patient's anxiety with medications and psychological support."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old patient in the ICU who was weaned to nasal cannula during the day and received CPAP at night. They received an extra dose of PO ativan for anxiety overnight. The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, and their last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin on 09:03 AM on 09/25. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 98/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 13.1, hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, platelet count of 420 K/uL, and creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of platelet count and bleeding risks is necessary.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient is on CPAP, which may increase the risk of respiratory distress. Monitoring of respiratory status and adjusting CPAP settings as necessary is crucial.
3. Infection: The patient has received antibiotics, but the risk of infection remains. Close monitoring of vital signs, lab results, and antibiotic effectiveness is necessary.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are unstable, with a range of 70-205 mg/dL. Close monitoring of glucose levels and adjusting insulin doses as necessary is crucial.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a range of 0.9-142 mEq/L. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels and adjusting doses of electrolyte supplements as necessary is crucial.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, which may indicate kidney damage. Close monitoring of kidney function and adjusting treatment as necessary is crucial.
7. Thrombosis: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia and is at risk of developing thrombosis. Close monitoring of blood clots and adjusting anticoagulation therapy as necessary is crucial.
8. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of nausea and vomiting, which may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring of gastrointestinal symptoms and adjusting treatment as necessary is crucial."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 67F with CAD s/p CABG, CHF, COPD and complicated
   pulmonary history with prolonged tracheostomy with recent decannulation
   and subsequent fistula closure (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) with
   complicated MRSA PNA presented with worsened respiratory distress.  Now
   s/p bronchoscopy which did not reveal significant upper airway
   stenosis.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated on [**9-24**] after episode of
   flash pulmonary edema while being bathed and concern for upper airway
   obstruction due to previous intubations/trach.  Patient also has
   history of trace aspiration.  Completed 10 day course for aspiration
   pneumonia on [**9-25**]. Rigid bronchoscopy on [**9-25**] showed no significant upper
   airway stenosis.  Extubated successfully on [**2138-9-26**]. No episodes of
   respiratory distress overnight, but given history, will watch closely
   today as patient is advanced on her diet with aspiration precautions.
   - IP and ENT following, appreciate recs
   - watch patient closely overnight as we advance her diet today
   - strict aspiration precautions with PO intake
 regular food with thin
   liquids with aspiration precautions, but pills must be taken with
   thickened liquids
   - continue nebs
   - continue home lasix for interstial edema
   - ativan prn for anxiety
   .
   2.Hypotension.  Patient off pressors, still with some low BP overnight,
   but asymptomatic
   - monitor BP and fluid boluses prn
   3.   CAD.  Patient had troponin leak in setting of flash pulmonary
   edema/HTN.  Troponins have trended down.
   -continue ASA, BB
   - consider resuming ACEI when BP tolerates and if renal function
   continues to improve
   .
   4.  CHF.  Patient had episode of pulmonary edema requiring intubation
   on [**9-23**].  CXR yesterday showed mild interstitial edema.  Currently
   euvolemic, but will continue home lasix dose.   TTE recently done
   ([**9-12**]) showed preserved EF with some focal wall motion abnormality.
   Patient euvolemic and net even overnight without any additional
   diuretics
   -continue home lasix
   -monitor I/Os
   -Continue BB
   - holding ACEI until blood pressure stable
   .
   5.  ARF.  Pre-renal ARF is resolved now.  Cr now 1.0.
   - consider resuming lisinopril when BP tolerates, Cr improved
   6.   COPD.
    -continue nebs
   .
   7. Depression/anxiety.  Patient has significant anxiety.
   -ativan prn anxiety, caution not to oversedate. Can change Ativan from
   IV to PO
   -Continue home lamotrigine, quetiapine, sertraline
   .
   8.  Hyperlipidemia:
   -Continue statin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 67-year-old female, is being treated in the ICU for various medical conditions, including respiratory failure, hypotension, CAD, CHF, ARF, COPD, depression/anxiety, and hyperlipidemia.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, as she was successfully extubated on 9/26 and is now on nasal cannula with CPAP at night. However, she is at risk for respiratory distress due to her history of aspiration and prolonged tracheostomy.

The patient's blood pressure is still a concern, with episodes of hypotension overnight, but she is asymptomatic. Her cardiac condition is stable, with troponin levels trending down.

The patient's kidney function has improved, with a current creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's nutritional status is being monitored, and she is being advanced to a regular diet with aspiration precautions. Her glycemic control is being managed, and her lines are being monitored.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient's history of aspiration and prolonged tracheostomy puts her at risk for respiratory distress, which could lead to reintubation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's episodes of hypotension overnight could worsen if not closely monitored and managed.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's CAD and CHF put her at risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or acute coronary syndrome.
4. Renal function decline: The patient's ARF could worsen if her kidney function declines further.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's slightly elevated potassium level could lead to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
6. Aspiration: The patient's history of aspiration and prolonged tracheostomy puts her at risk for aspiration pneumonia, which could worsen her respiratory status.
7. Anxiety: The patient's significant anxiety could worsen if not managed with proper medication and therapy.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 67F with CAD s/p CABG, CHF, COPD and complicated
   pulmonary history with prolonged tracheostomy with recent decannulation
   and subsequent fistula closure (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) with
   complicated MRSA PNA presented with worsened respiratory distress.  Now
   s/p bronchoscopy which did not reveal significant upper airway
   stenosis.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated on [**9-24**] after episode of
   flash pulmonary edema while being bathed and concern for upper airway
   obstruction due to previous intubations/trach.  Patient also has
   history of trace aspiration.  Completed 10 day course for aspiration
   pneumonia on [**9-25**]. Rigid bronchoscopy on [**9-25**] showed no significant upper
   airway stenosis.  Extubated successfully on [**2138-9-26**]. No episodes of
   respiratory distress overnight, but given history, will watch closely
   today as patient is advanced on her diet with aspiration precautions.
   - IP and ENT following, appreciate recs
   - watch patient closely overnight as we advance her diet today
   - strict aspiration precautions with PO intake
 regular food with thin
   liquids with aspiration precautions, but pills must be taken with
   thickened liquids
   - continue nebs
   - continue home lasix for interstial edema
   - ativan prn for anxiety
   .
   2.Hypotension.  Patient off pressors, still with some low BP overnight,
   but asymptomatic
   - monitor BP and fluid boluses prn
   3.   CAD.  Patient had troponin leak in setting of flash pulmonary
   edema/HTN.  Troponins have trended down.
   -continue ASA, BB
   - consider resuming ACEI when BP tolerates and if renal function
   continues to improve
   .
   4.  CHF.  Patient had episode of pulmonary edema requiring intubation
   on [**9-23**].  CXR yesterday showed mild interstitial edema.  Currently
   euvolemic, but will continue home lasix dose.   TTE recently done
   ([**9-12**]) showed preserved EF with some focal wall motion abnormality.
   Patient euvolemic and net even overnight without any additional
   diuretics
   -continue home lasix
   -monitor I/Os
   -Continue BB
   - holding ACEI until blood pressure stable
   .
   5.  ARF.  Pre-renal ARF is resolved now.  Cr now 1.0.
   - consider resuming lisinopril when BP tolerates, Cr improved
   6.   COPD.
    -continue nebs
   .
   7. Depression/anxiety.  Patient has significant anxiety.
   -ativan prn anxiety, caution not to oversedate. Can change Ativan from
   IV to PO
   -Continue home lamotrigine, quetiapine, sertraline
   .
   8.  Hyperlipidemia:
   -Continue statin

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's current condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated after an episode of flash pulmonary edema and was extubated successfully on [**2138-9-26**]. However, the patient has a history of trace aspiration and is at risk for respiratory distress, especially with advancement of their diet.
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still low, but they are asymptomatic.
* CAD: The patient has a history of CAD and had a troponin leak in the setting of flash pulmonary edema/HTN. Troponins have trended down.
* CHF: The patient had an episode of pulmonary edema requiring intubation and has mild interstitial edema on CXR. They are currently euvolemic and will continue their home lasix dose.
* ARF: The patient's pre-renal ARF is resolved, and their creatinine has improved to 1.0.
* COPD: The patient has COPD and is being treated with nebs.
* Depression/anxiety: The patient has significant anxiety and is being treated with Ativan prn.
* Hyperlipidemia: The patient is being treated with a statin.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory distress due to their history of trace aspiration and advancement of their diet.
* Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may worsen if not properly managed.
* CAD: The patient's CAD is still a concern, and they may be at risk for further cardiac events.
* CHF: The patient's CHF is still a concern, and they may be at risk for further episodes of pulmonary edema.
* ARF: The patient's ARF is resolved, but they may be at risk for further kidney damage if not properly managed.
* COPD: The patient's COPD may worsen if not properly managed.
* Depression/anxiety: The patient's depression and anxiety may worsen if not properly managed.
* Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may worsen if not properly managed.

**Plan:**

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and watch for signs of respiratory distress.
* Monitor the patient's blood pressure and fluid status to prevent hypotension.
* Continue to manage the patient's CAD, CHF, and ARF with appropriate medications and treatments.
* Continue to treat the patient's COPD with nebs.
* Continue to manage the patient's depression and anxiety with Ativan prn and other medications as needed.
* Continue to manage the patient's hyperlipidemia with a statin.
* Continue to advance the patient's diet with aspiration precautions and monitor for signs of respiratory distress."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 67F with CAD s/p CABG, CHF, COPD and complicated
   pulmonary history with prolonged tracheostomy with recent decannulation
   and subsequent fistula closure (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) with
   complicated MRSA PNA presented with worsened respiratory distress.  Now
   s/p bronchoscopy which did not reveal significant upper airway
   stenosis.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated on [**9-24**] after episode of
   flash pulmonary edema while being bathed and concern for upper airway
   obstruction due to previous intubations/trach.  Patient also has
   history of trace aspiration.  Completed 10 day course for aspiration
   pneumonia on [**9-25**]. Rigid bronchoscopy on [**9-25**] showed no significant upper
   airway stenosis.  Extubated successfully on [**2138-9-26**]. No episodes of
   respiratory distress overnight, but given history, will watch closely
   today as patient is advanced on her diet with aspiration precautions.
   - IP and ENT following, appreciate recs
   - watch patient closely overnight as we advance her diet today
   - strict aspiration precautions with PO intake
 regular food with thin
   liquids with aspiration precautions, but pills must be taken with
   thickened liquids
   - continue nebs
   - continue home lasix for interstial edema
   - ativan prn for anxiety
   .
   2.Hypotension.  Patient off pressors, still with some low BP overnight,
   but asymptomatic
   - monitor BP and fluid boluses prn
   3.   CAD.  Patient had troponin leak in setting of flash pulmonary
   edema/HTN.  Troponins have trended down.
   -continue ASA, BB
   - consider resuming ACEI when BP tolerates and if renal function
   continues to improve
   .
   4.  CHF.  Patient had episode of pulmonary edema requiring intubation
   on [**9-23**].  CXR yesterday showed mild interstitial edema.  Currently
   euvolemic, but will continue home lasix dose.   TTE recently done
   ([**9-12**]) showed preserved EF with some focal wall motion abnormality.
   Patient euvolemic and net even overnight without any additional
   diuretics
   -continue home lasix
   -monitor I/Os
   -Continue BB
   - holding ACEI until blood pressure stable
   .
   5.  ARF.  Pre-renal ARF is resolved now.  Cr now 1.0.
   - consider resuming lisinopril when BP tolerates, Cr improved
   6.   COPD.
    -continue nebs
   .
   7. Depression/anxiety.  Patient has significant anxiety.
   -ativan prn anxiety, caution not to oversedate. Can change Ativan from
   IV to PO
   -Continue home lamotrigine, quetiapine, sertraline
   .

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including CAD, CHF, COPD, and complicated pulmonary history. She was admitted to the ICU with worsening respiratory distress and was intubated due to flash pulmonary edema. She was extubated successfully on 9/26 and is currently on a regular diet with aspiration precautions.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and is at risk for respiratory distress. She will be closely monitored overnight as her diet is advanced.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, but she is asymptomatic. Fluid boluses will be given as needed.
3. CAD: The patient had a troponin leak in the setting of flash pulmonary edema/HTN. Troponins have trended down, and she will continue ASA and BB.
4. CHF: The patient had an episode of pulmonary edema requiring intubation. She is currently euvolemic, and her TTE showed preserved EF with some focal wall motion abnormality. She will continue home lasix and BB.
5. ARF: The patient's pre-renal ARF is resolved, and her Cr has improved to 1.0.
6. COPD: The patient will continue nebs.
7. Depression/anxiety: The patient has significant anxiety and will be given ativan prn. She will also continue home lamotrigine, quetiapine, and sertraline.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient will continue statin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory distress: The patient's history of aspiration pneumonia and complicated pulmonary history put her at risk for respiratory distress. Close monitoring is necessary.
* Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may worsen if not managed properly. Fluid boluses and medication adjustments may be necessary.
* CAD: The patient's CAD history increases her risk for cardiac complications. ASA and BB will be continued to manage her CAD.
* CHF: The patient's CHF history increases her risk for cardiac complications. Home lasix and BB will be continued to manage her CHF.
* ARF: The patient's pre-renal ARF is resolved, but close monitoring of her renal function is necessary to prevent future episodes.
* COPD: The patient's COPD increases her risk for respiratory complications. Nebs will be continued to manage her COPD.
* Depression/anxiety: The patient's depression and anxiety may worsen if not managed properly. Ativan prn and home medication will be continued to manage her depression and anxiety.
* Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia increases her risk for cardiovascular complications. Statin will be continued to manage her hyperlipidemia.

Overall, the patient's medical conditions are complex and require close monitoring and management to prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 67F with CAD s/p CABG, CHF, COPD and complicated
   pulmonary history with prolonged tracheostomy with recent decannulation
   and subsequent fistula closure (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) with
   complicated MRSA PNA presented with worsened respiratory distress.  Now
   s/p bronchoscopy which did not reveal significant upper airway
   stenosis.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated on [**9-24**] after episode of
   flash pulmonary edema while being bathed and concern for upper airway
   obstruction due to previous intubations/trach.  Patient also has
   history of trace aspiration.  Completed 10 day course for aspiration
   pneumonia on [**9-25**]. Rigid bronchoscopy on [**9-25**] showed no significant upper
   airway stenosis.  Extubated successfully on [**2138-9-26**]. No episodes of
   respiratory distress overnight, but given history, will watch closely
   today as patient is advanced on her diet with aspiration precautions.
   - IP and ENT following, appreciate recs
   - watch patient closely overnight as we advance her diet today
   - strict aspiration precautions with PO intake
 regular food with thin
   liquids with aspiration precautions, but pills must be taken with
   thickened liquids
   - continue nebs
   - continue home lasix for interstial edema
   - ativan prn for anxiety
   .
   2.Hypotension.  Patient off pressors, still with some low BP overnight,
   but asymptomatic
   - monitor BP and fluid boluses prn
   3.   CAD.  Patient had troponin leak in setting of flash pulmonary
   edema/HTN.  Troponins have trended down.
   -continue ASA, BB
   - consider resuming ACEI when BP tolerates and if renal function
   continues to improve
   .
   4.  CHF.  Patient had episode of pulmonary edema requiring intubation
   on [**9-23**].  CXR yesterday showed mild interstitial edema.  Currently
   euvolemic, but will continue home lasix dose.   TTE recently done
   ([**9-12**]) showed preserved EF with some focal wall motion abnormality.
   Patient euvolemic and net even overnight without any additional
   diuretics
   -continue home lasix
   -monitor I/Os
   -Continue BB
   - holding ACEI until blood pressure stable
   .
   5.  ARF.  Pre-renal ARF is resolved now.  Cr now 1.0.
   - consider resuming lisinopril when BP tolerates, Cr improved
   6.   COPD.
    -continue nebs
   .
   7. Depression/anxiety.  Patient has significant anxiety.
   -ativan prn anxiety, caution not to oversedate. Can change Ativan from
   IV to PO
   -Continue home lamotrigine, quetiapine, sertraline
   .
   8.  Hyperlipidemia:
   -Continue statin

   Disposition: ICU care for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory distress, aspiration pneumonia, and prolonged tracheostomy. Although they were successfully extubated, they will need to be closely monitored for any signs of respiratory distress, particularly with the advancement of their diet.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been low, and they may require fluid boluses to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD, CHF, and a recent episode of flash pulmonary edema. They will need to continue ASA and BB therapy, and consider resuming ACEI when their blood pressure stabilizes.
4. Chronic kidney disease: The patient has pre-renal ARF, which is resolved, but they will need to continue monitoring their creatinine levels and consider resuming lisinopril when their blood pressure is stable.
5. Anxiety and depression: The patient has significant anxiety and depression, and will need to continue therapy with Ativan, lamotrigine, quetiapine, and sertraline.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient will need to continue statin therapy to manage their hyperlipidemia.
7. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, and will need to continue strict aspiration precautions with PO intake, including taking pills with thickened liquids.
8. Intestinal edema: The patient has a history of pulmonary edema, and will need to continue home lasix therapy to manage their interstitial edema.
9. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiovascular system is unstable, and they will need to be closely monitored for any signs of cardiovascular instability, including changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following laboratory results are concerning:

* Troponin leak: The patient's troponin levels have trended down, but they are still elevated, indicating cardiac damage.
* Creatinine levels: The patient's creatinine levels have improved, but they are still elevated, indicating kidney damage.
* Lactic acid levels: The patient's lactic acid levels are elevated, indicating tissue hypoxia and potentially poor tissue perfusion.
* Calcium and magnesium levels: The patient's calcium and magnesium levels are low, indicating potential electrolyte imbalances.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following imaging studies are concerning:

* Chest X-ray: The patient's chest X-ray shows mild interstitial edema, indicating potential pulmonary edema.
* TTE: The patient's TTE shows preserved EF with some focal wall motion abnormality, indicating potential cardiac damage.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medications are concerning:

* Ativan: The patient is taking Ativan for anxiety, but it may need to be changed to PO from IV to avoid oversedation.
* Lasix: The patient is taking Lasix for interstitial edema, but it may need to be adjusted based on their fluid status.
* ACEI: The patient is holding ACEI until their blood pressure is stable, but it may need to be resumed when their blood pressure stabilizes.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications, including respiratory failure, hypotension, cardiac complications, chronic kidney disease, anxiety and depression, hyperlipidemia, aspiration pneumonia, intestinal edema, and cardiovascular instability. They will need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent these complications and improve their overall health outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 67F with CAD s/p CABG, CHF, COPD and complicated
   pulmonary history with prolonged tracheostomy with recent decannulation
   and subsequent fistula closure (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) with
   complicated MRSA PNA presented with worsened respiratory distress.  Now
   s/p bronchoscopy which did not reveal significant upper airway
   stenosis.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated on [**9-24**] after episode of
   flash pulmonary edema while being bathed and concern for upper airway
   obstruction due to previous intubations/trach.  Patient also has
   history of trace aspiration.  Completed 10 day course for aspiration
   pneumonia on [**9-25**]. Rigid bronchoscopy on [**9-25**] showed no significant upper
   airway stenosis.  Extubated successfully on [**2138-9-26**]. No episodes of
   respiratory distress overnight, but given history, will watch closely
   today as patient is advanced on her diet with aspiration precautions.
   - IP and ENT following, appreciate recs
   - strict aspiration precautions with PO intake
 regular food with thin
   liquids with aspiration precautions, but pills must be taken with
   thickened liquids
   - continue nebs
   - continue home lasix for interstial edema
   - ativan prn for anxiety
   .
   2.Hypotension. resolved.
   - monitor BP
   -will need to add back ace I in next 1-2 days
   3.   CAD.  Patient had troponin leak in setting of flash pulmonary
   edema/HTN.  Troponins have trended down.
   -continue ASA, BB
   - consider resuming ACEI when BP tolerates and if renal function
   continues to improve
   .
   4.  CHF.  Patient had episode of pulmonary edema requiring intubation
   on [**9-23**].  CXR yesterday showed mild interstitial edema.  Currently
   euvolemic, but will continue home lasix dose.   TTE recently done
   ([**9-12**]) showed preserved EF with some focal wall motion abnormality.
   Patient euvolemic and net even overnight without any additional
   diuretics
   -continue home lasix
   -monitor I/Os
   -Continue BB
   - holding ACEI until blood pressure stable
   .
   5.  ARF.  Pre-renal ARF is resolved now.  Cr now 1.0.
   - consider resuming lisinopril when BP tolerates, Cr improved
   6.   COPD.

Summary:

The patient, a 67-year-old female, is a complex case with a history of CAD, CHF, COPD, and complicated pulmonary history. She presented with worsened respiratory distress, intubated, and later extubated. She has been advanced on her diet with aspiration precautions, and is currently receiving various medications for her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, and the risk of recurrence is high, especially with the advancement of her diet. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent respiratory distress.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has a history of trace aspiration, and the risk of aspiration pneumonia is high, especially with the advancement of her diet. Close monitoring and strict aspiration precautions are necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved, but the risk of recurrence is high, especially with the advancement of her diet. Close monitoring and adjustment of medications as necessary are necessary.
4. CAD: The patient has a history of CAD, and the risk of cardiac complications is high, especially with the advancement of her diet. Close monitoring and adjustment of medications as necessary are necessary.
5. CHF: The patient has a history of CHF, and the risk of cardiac complications is high, especially with the advancement of her diet. Close monitoring and adjustment of medications as necessary are necessary.
6. ARF: The patient's pre-renal ARF has resolved, but the risk of recurrence is high, especially with the advancement of her diet. Close monitoring and adjustment of medications as necessary are necessary.
7. Depression/Anxiety: The patient has significant anxiety, and the risk of worsening depression and anxiety is high, especially with the advancement of her diet. Close monitoring and adjustment of medications as necessary are necessary.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, and the risk of worsening hyperlipidemia is high, especially with the advancement of her diet. Close monitoring and adjustment of medications as necessary are necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, including oxygen saturation and respiratory rate.
2. Strict aspiration precautions, including thin liquids and thickened liquids for medication.
3. Close monitoring of the patient's blood pressure, and adjustment of medications as necessary.
4. Close monitoring of the patient's cardiac status, including ECG and cardiac enzymes.
5. Close monitoring of the patient's kidney function, including creatinine and blood urea nitrogen.
6. Close monitoring of the patient's mental status, including depression and anxiety.
7. Close monitoring of the patient's lipid profile, including cholesterol and triglycerides.
8. Consideration of a multidisciplinary approach, including a pulmonary specialist, cardiologist, and nephrologist, to optimize the patient's care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and complicated pulmonary history, including tracheobronchiomalacia, tracheal decannulation, and recent tracheal fistula repair due to MRSA pneumonia. She presented with respiratory failure and was intubated. The patient was recently extubated and is now on CPAP per her home regimen. Her respiratory status has improved, and she is tolerating a regular diet.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of tracheobronchiomalacia and tracheal fistula repair makes her prone to respiratory complications. The possibility of a mucus plug causing aspiration is a concern, and the patient should continue to receive aspiration precautions.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CAD and recent troponin elevation suggest a potential cardiac event. The patient's blood pressure is stable, and she is off antihypertensives, but further cardiac monitoring is necessary.
3. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of tracheal fistula repair and recent antibiotics increases her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as diarrhea or constipation.
4. Infection: The patient's history of MRSA pneumonia and recent antibiotics increases her risk of developing another infection.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's history of tracheal fistula repair and recent respiratory failure increases her risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or cognitive impairment.

Recommendations:

1. Continue aspiration precautions to prevent further respiratory complications.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust medications as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely and adjust medications as necessary.
4. Continue antibiotics as prescribed and monitor for signs of infection.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and adjust medications as necessary.
6. Consider a swallow evaluation to assess the patient's risk of aspiration.
7. Consider a stress test to assess the patient's cardiac function.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust CPAP settings as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   67yo woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG, complicated pulmonary history
   including tracheobronchiomalacia, trach / decannulation, and recent
   tracheal fistula repair (on ENT service at [**Hospital1 54**] on [**9-12**]) c/b MRSA
   pneumonia presenting with respiratory distress.  Suspect mucus plug as
   the etiology +/- aspiration.  Now much improved, s/p extubation [**9-26**].
   1) Respiratory failure:  Acute event the other night appears to be due
   to a mucus plug with aspiration in RLL.  No airway pathology seen on
   rigid bronch.
   - aspiration precautions
   - no evidence of pneumonia, off antibiotics
   - standing inhalers/nebs
   - CPAP prn per home regimen
   - appreciate ENT & IP input
   2) Elevated troponin/Hx CHF:  Likely demand in setting of hypotension,
   now resolving.  No ECG changes.
   - on home dose of lasix
   - bp stable off antihypertensives
   3) F/E/N: Diet per speech/swallow recommendations.
   4) Anxiety:  ativan prn (home regimen.)

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and a complicated pulmonary history, including tracheobronchiomalacia, tracheal decannulation, and recent tracheal fistula repair. She was admitted with respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia and presented with respiratory distress.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.3°C (97.4°F)
* Heart rate: 78 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 106/55 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (bpm)
* SpO2: 92%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Well-nourished, no acute distress, breathing comfortably, eating lunch
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds
* Respiratory/Chest: Symmetric expansion, no crackles or wheezes
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
* Extremities: Right and left absent
* Skin: Warm
* Neurologic: Attentive, conversant

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 13.1-6.8 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 32.3-30.5%
* Platelet count: 74-420 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.3-0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.03-0.13 ng/mL
* Glucose: 70-115 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's acute event is suspected to be due to a mucus plug with aspiration in the right lower lobe (RLL). Aspiration precautions are recommended, and the patient is off antibiotics.
* Elevated troponin/Hx CHF: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, likely due to demand in the setting of hypotension. No ECG changes are noted.
* F/E/N: The patient is advised to follow a diet per speech/swallow recommendations.
* Anxiety: Ativan is prescribed prn (as needed) per the patient's home regimen.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Pneumonia: The patient's history of tracheobronchiomalacia and recent tracheal fistula repair may increase her risk of developing pneumonia.
* Aspiration: The patient's history of tracheobronchiomalacia and recent tracheal fistula repair may increase her risk of aspiration.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's history of tracheobronchiomalacia and recent tracheal fistula repair may increase her risk of respiratory failure.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and elevated troponin levels may increase her risk of cardiac complications.
* Anemia: The patient's low hematocrit levels may indicate anemia.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may indicate thrombocytopenia.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's abnormal electrolyte levels may indicate an imbalance.
* Infection: The patient's history of MRSA pneumonia and recent tracheal fistula repair may increase her risk of infection.
* Anxiety and depression: The patient's history of anxiety and depression may increase her risk of developing these conditions during her hospital stay."
