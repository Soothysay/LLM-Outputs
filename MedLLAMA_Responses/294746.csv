Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient, a 79-year-old female with a history of NSCLC with liver metastases, was admitted to the MICU for tachycardia and hypotension. She underwent fasciotomy on [**12-10**] for left calf hematoma-related compartment syndrome and was transferred to the ICU.

The patient experienced two episodes of SVT, with the second episode occurring last night. She was treated with Adenosine and converted to sinus rhythm. However, she became tachycardic and felt warm after starting heparin infusion, which was subsequently stopped.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 7.7 K/uL
* Hct: 32.1%
* Plt: 261 K/uL
* Cr: 0.9 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.04 ng/mL
* Glucose: 146 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 29.2/33.0/2.9, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 296/3/0.03, Differential-Neuts: 80.9%, Lymph: 11.5%, Mono: 5.5%, Eos: 1.9%, Ca++: 8.1 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL, PO4: 2.5 mg/dL

The patient's vital signs are:

* Tmax: 37.1°C (98.8°F)
* Tcurrent: 37.1°C (98.8°F)
* HR: 97 bpm (86-174 bpm)
* BP: 128/66 mmHg (79-153/82-118 mmHg)
* RR: 21 inspirations per minute (16-25 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 94%

The patient's physical examination is:

* GEN: NAD, lying comfortably in bed
* CVS: +S1/S2, no M/R/G, RRR
* LUNGS: +mild crackles in right lung field, no wheezes or ronchi
* ABD: +BS, NT/ND
* EXT: +2 distal pulses, +kurlex bandage over left calf

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Recurrence of SVT: The patient has experienced two episodes of SVT, and there is a risk of recurrence.
2. Compartment syndrome: The patient has a history of left leg compartment syndrome, and there is a risk of recurrence or development of compartment syndrome in other extremities.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient has a bleeding disorder and is taking anticoagulant medications, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of bilateral PE and is at risk of developing infection.
5. Metastatic disease progression: The patient has metastatic NSCLC, and there is a risk of disease progression.
6. Anemia: The patient has normocytic anemia, and there is a risk of further anemia due to ongoing bleeding or other causes.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan has been proposed:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Restart coumadin and monitor INR.
3. Hold on Lovenox given recent compartment syndrome.
4. Contact outpatient oncologist regarding optimal anticoagulation regimen.
5. Continue cefazolin perioperatively.
6. Monitor daily HCTs and transfuse for HCT <24.
7. Continue IVFs, replete lytes prn, and regular diet.
8. Continue PPI, coumadin, and bowel regimen.
9. Monitor the patient's physical examination and laboratory results for any signs of complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and liver metastases, who was admitted to the ICU for tachycardia and hypotension after a recent bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosis and fasciotomy for left calf hematoma-related compartment syndrome. She had a narrow complex tachycardia that converted to sinus rhythm with 6mg IV adenosine. Her hypotension resolved, but underlying causes for her tachycardia and hypotension include recent surgery, missed doses of diltiazem, new PE, hyperthyroidism, and possible myocardial infarction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrence of tachycardia and hypotension: Given the patient's history of tachycardia and hypotension, it is essential to monitor her closely for any signs of recurrence, especially in the post-operative period.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of bilateral PE and recent surgery increases her risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as heparin SQ and compression stockings should be implemented.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's history of lung cancer and recent surgery may increase her risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia, atelectasis, and respiratory failure. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and prompt treatment of any respiratory symptoms are essential.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of recent surgery and medications such as PPI may increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Close monitoring of her gastrointestinal status and prompt treatment of any symptoms are essential.
5. Infection: The patient's history of recent surgery and medications such as antibiotics may increase her risk of infection. Close monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results, as well as prompt treatment of any signs of infection, are essential.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of recent surgery and possible myocardial infarction may increase her risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Close monitoring of her cardiac status and prompt treatment of any cardiac symptoms are essential.
7. Anemia: The patient's history of normocytic anemia may worsen in the post-operative period. Close monitoring of her hemoglobin levels and prompt treatment of any signs of anemia are essential.
8. Metastatic Spread: The patient's history of metastatic NSCLC may lead to further metastatic spread to other organs. Close monitoring of her laboratory results and imaging studies, as well as prompt treatment of any signs of metastatic spread, are essential."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with liver metastases, who was admitted to the ICU for tachycardia and hypotension following a recent bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosis and bilateral fasciotomy for left calf hematoma-related compartment syndrome.

The patient experienced several significant events during the 24-hour period, including:

1. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) that was treated with adenosine and converted to sinus rhythm.
2. Heparin infusion was stopped due to concerns of an allergic reaction.
3. The patient underwent closure of the fasciotomy wound in the operating room without complications.
4. The patient's laboratory results showed normocytic anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated troponin levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of PE and SVT increases the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of PE and lung cancer increases the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of constipation and recent surgery increases the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction, perforation, and bleeding.
4. Hematological complications: The patient's history of anemia and recent surgery increases the risk of hematological complications, such as bleeding, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.
5. Infection complications: The patient's history of recent surgery and immunosuppression increases the risk of infection complications, such as sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections.
6. Metastatic complications: The patient's history of NSCLC with liver metastases increases the risk of metastatic complications, such as liver failure, brain metastases, and spinal cord compression.

Based on these potential complications, the patient's plan of care should include close monitoring of her cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, hematological, and infectious status, as well as aggressive management of any potential complications that arise."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour follow-up in the ICU after being admitted with a fasciotomy closure. The patient had an episode of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) at 2 am, which was converted to sinus rhythm with adenosine. The patient was taken to the OR for closure of the fasciotomy, which was uneventful. Heparin was started, but the patient became tachycardic and warm, leading to its discontinuation due to suspected allergic reaction. The patient has a history of allergies to morphine, oxycodone, penicillins, and prednisone.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.8°F, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 128/66 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 94%. The patient's lab results show normal renal function, electrolyte levels, and hemoglobin. However, the patient has an elevated white blood cell count and a slight increase in creatinine.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. SVT: The patient's history of SVT and the need for adenosine conversion to sinus rhythm suggest that the patient may be at risk for future episodes of SVT.
2. Allergic Reaction: The patient's suspected allergic reaction to heparin may lead to further allergic reactions to other medications or substances.
3. Constipation: The patient's diagnosis of constipation may lead to further complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
4. Headache: The patient's headache may be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as a neurological disorder or a medication side effect.
5. DVT: The patient's history of fasciotomy and the need for anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
6. VAP: The patient's use of a nasogastric tube and the risk of aspiration may increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's vital signs and lab results closely for any signs of worsening SVT or allergic reactions.
2. Consider alternative anticoagulation therapy options to minimize the risk of allergic reactions.
3. Implement a bowel regimen to manage the patient's constipation.
4. Investigate the cause of the patient's headache and consider imaging studies or neurological consultation if necessary.
5. Implement DVT prophylaxis measures, such as compression stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression devices.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider switching to a different oxygen delivery device if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic NSCLC, who underwent RML lobectomy and chemotherapy. She developed bilateral PE and was admitted to the ICU for L calf compartment syndrome, which required fasciotomy and closure. The patient also experienced AVNRT, which was treated with adenosine. Currently, she is being treated for pain, respiratory support, and cardiac monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Fluid Overload: The patient's respiratory support and possible fluid overload from the surgery may lead to respiratory distress.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's sinus tachycardia and unclear etiology may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, which could worsen her condition.
3. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to chemotherapy and metastatic disease may lead to infections, which could be life-threatening.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of bilateral PE and current anticoagulation therapy may lead to DVT, which could be a life-threatening complication.
5. Sepsis: The patient's compromised immune system and possible infections may lead to sepsis, which could be life-threatening.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory support and possible fluid overload may lead to respiratory failure, which could be life-threatening.
7. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrhythmias and possible cardiac complications may lead to cardiac arrest, which could be life-threatening.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's compromised immune system and possible infections may lead to neurological complications, such as meningitis or encephalitis, which could be life-threatening.
9. Renal Failure: The patient's compromised immune system and possible infections may lead to renal failure, which could be life-threatening.
10. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's compromised immune system and possible infections may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as diarrhea or constipation, which could worsen her condition."

   note, including assessment and plan. Recurrent episode of SVT
   overnight, requiring adenosine.  Currently in sinus rhythm, though

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   I saw and examined this pt, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of services provided. I agree with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 575**]
   note, including assessment and plan. Recurrent episode of SVT
   overnight, requiring adenosine.  Currently in sinus rhythm, though
   tachycardic. Suboptimal pain control likely contributing. Plan to
   increase diltiazem and pain regimen. Appears okay for floor transfer.

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic NSCLC, s/p RML lobectomy and chemo, and bilateral PE. She presented with L calf compartment syndrome, requiring fasciotomy and closure. She also developed AVNRT, which was treated with adenosine. The patient has been experiencing sinus tachycardia, with a baseline heart rate in the 90s, and has not yet been able to achieve optimal pain control.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, a heart rate of 116 bpm, and a blood pressure of 157/67 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 94%. She is receiving oxygen via nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance, with no signs of distress or discomfort. Her eyes, ears, nose, and throat are normal, and her cardiovascular examination is unremarkable. Her respiratory examination shows symmetric expansion and crackles throughout the right side of the chest.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Hemoglobin: 10.6 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 7.7 K/uL
* Platelet count: 261 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.04 ng/mL
* Glucose: 146 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* S/p fasciotomy and closure for L calf compartment syndrome
* S/p AVNRT, which was treated with adenosine
* Recurrent episode of SVT overnight, requiring adenosine
* Suboptimal pain control, likely contributing to the patient's tachycardia
* Plan to increase diltiazem and pain regimen
* Appears okay for floor transfer

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Fluid overload, given the patient's history of bilateral PE and the presence of crackles in the right chest
* Respiratory failure, given the patient's tachypnea and the presence of crackles in the right chest
* Cardiac arrhythmias, given the patient's history of AVNRT and sinus tachycardia
* Infection, given the patient's history of bilateral PE and the presence of crackles in the right chest
* Pain management issues, given the patient's suboptimal pain control and the need for increased diltiazem and pain regimen.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but there are several potential medical complications that can arise from her condition. Close monitoring and management of her condition are necessary to prevent these complications and ensure her optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with liver metastases, who was recently diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and underwent fasciotomy for left calf hematoma-related compartment syndrome. She was transferred to the MICU for tachycardia and hypotension.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT): She has a long history of SVT, likely due to atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT). She has been experiencing frequent episodes, which have been terminated with adenosine. A plan for electrophysiology study (EPS) and ablation has been made for the next day.
2. Bilateral PEs: Likely secondary to her known metastatic malignancy. Heparin was attempted last night but was discontinued due to tachycardia and hot sensation. Coumadin was restarted, and the patient is being monitored for INR.
3. Left leg compartment syndrome: The patient underwent closure in the OR and is doing well.
4. Normocytic anemia: Her hemoglobin level is 10.6 g/dL, which is stable over this hospitalization. Her baseline HCT appears to be around 30, which may be fluctuating due to recent surgery.
5. Metastatic NSCLC: Not actively being treated during this hospitalization.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's frequent episodes of SVT can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even sudden cardiac death.
2. Pulmonary embolism complications: The patient's bilateral PEs can lead to respiratory failure, hypoxia, or even death.
3. Infection: The patient's recent surgery and presence of central lines and catheters increase her risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
4. Bleeding: The patient's use of coumadin and recent surgery increase her risk of bleeding complications.
5. Anemia complications: The patient's normocytic anemia can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, or decreased exercise tolerance.
6. Metastatic disease progression: The patient's metastatic NSCLC can progress, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuing diltiazem 90mg po qid
2. Restarting coumadin and monitoring INR
3. Continuing adenosine PRN
4. Monitoring on telemetry
5. Following up with orthopedic recommendations
6. Determining the course of cefazolin perioperatively
7. Monitoring daily HCTs and transfusing for HCT<24
8. Providing IVFs and repleting lytes PRN
9. Maintaining a regular diet
10. Providing PPI, coumadin, and bowel regimen as needed"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission who has been experiencing supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and has been managed with diltiazem. The patient's Coumadin has been continued with oncology's approval over Lovenox. The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, and the floor team is hesitant to take the patient due to the risk of recurrent SVT. An electrophysiology study (EPS) is planned for the morning, and consideration is being given to ablation if the patient's goals of care align with this option.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrent SVT: The patient's history of SVT and the fact that the floor team is hesitant to take the patient due to the risk of recurrent SVT suggest that this is a potential complication.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of SVT and the presence of other cardiac medications (e.g., diltiazem) suggest that cardiac arrhythmias may be a potential complication.
3. Bleeding: The patient's continued use of Coumadin and the potential for bleeding complications if the patient undergoes ablation or other invasive procedures.
4. Infection: The patient's history of antibiotic use and the presence of a central line suggest that infection is a potential complication.
5. Constipation: The patient's history of constipation and the presence of a nasogastric tube suggest that constipation may be a potential complication.
6. Headache: The patient's history of headache and the presence of other medications (e.g., diltiazem) suggest that headache may be a potential complication.
7. DVT: The patient's history of DVT prophylaxis and the presence of a central line suggest that DVT may be a potential complication.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient's history of stress ulcer prophylaxis and the presence of a central line suggest that stress ulcer may be a potential complication.
9. VAP: The patient's history of VAP prophylaxis and the presence of a central line suggest that VAP may be a potential complication."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and liver metastases. She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for tachycardia and hypotension.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.2°C, Heart rate 93 bpm, Blood pressure 147/63 mmHg, Respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute, and SpO2 96%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is on telemetry and has been experiencing supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which peaked to 170-190 beats per minute.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 2,676 mL of fluid, with 1,856 mL being intravenous fluid, and 820 mL being oral fluid.
* Lab results:
	+ Complete Blood Count (CBC): White Blood Cell count 7.7 K/uL, Hemoglobin 10.6 g/dL, Platelet count 261 K/uL.
	+ Electrolytes: Sodium 138 mEq/L, Potassium 4.4 mEq/L, Chloride 105 mEq/L.
	+ Renal function: Creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) 12 mg/dL.
	+ Coagulation studies: International Normalized Ratio (INR) 2.9, Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) 33.0 seconds.
* Physical examination: The patient is afebrile, with normal heart sounds, and bilateral radial and pedal pulses present. She has right and left lower extremity edema, which is 1+.
* Medications: The patient is receiving coumadin, diltiazem, adenosine, and cefazolin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding complications due to the patient's history of liver metastases and anticoagulation therapy.
2. Respiratory failure due to the patient's history of bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and potential respiratory compromise.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias, including SVT, which can lead to cardiac arrest.
4. Infection, particularly in the setting of recent surgery and central line placement.
5. Constipation, which can lead to bowel obstruction and other complications.
6. Compartment syndrome, particularly in the left leg, which can lead to further tissue damage and potential amputation.
7. Nutritional deficiencies, particularly in the setting of recent surgery and potential malabsorption.
8. Medication interactions and side effects, particularly with the patient's history of multiple medications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her care plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure her optimal recovery."

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who underwent right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy. She developed bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) one month ago and is currently on coumadin. She was admitted to the ICU due to compartment syndrome of the left calf, which required fasciotomy and closure. The patient is currently receiving pain management with dilaudid, bowel regimen, and orthopedic recommendations.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 147/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 261 K/uL. Her troponin-T level is 0.04 ng/mL, and her creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Fluid overload: The patient's lung crackles may indicate fluid overload, which can lead to respiratory distress and worsening of her condition.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of PE and current anticoagulation therapy with coumadin make her at risk for developing DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and use of pain medications may increase her risk of developing stress ulcers.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's use of respiratory support and prolonged intubation may increase her risk of developing VAP.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's sinus tachycardia and unclear etiology may indicate hemodynamic instability, which can worsen her condition.
6. Adverse effects of medications: The patient's use of pain medications, anticoagulants, and other medications may cause adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and bleeding.
7. Complications from compartment syndrome: The patient's compartment syndrome may lead to further complications, such as muscle damage, nerve damage, and chronic pain."

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 79-year-old female, is a post-operative patient who underwent a right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. She also had a bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) in October 2018. Recently, she underwent a fasciotomy and closure for left calf compartment syndrome and had two episodes of atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) that resolved with adenosine.

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Sinus tachycardia (SVT) with a heart rate of 93-183 beats per minute, which is unclear in etiology and may be related to the surgery.
2. Compartment syndrome in the left calf, which was managed with fasciotomy and closure.
3. AVNRT, which resolved with adenosine.
4. Bilateral PE, which is a known medical history.
5. Metastatic NSCLC, which is a known medical history.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias, such as SVT, which can lead to cardiac arrest or heart failure.
2. Compartment syndrome, which can lead to tissue necrosis, nerve damage, and permanent disability.
3. Pulmonary embolism, which can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, or death.
4. Metastatic NSCLC, which can lead to further complications such as respiratory failure, cardiac failure, or neurological deficits.
5. Infections, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, or sepsis, which can lead to septic shock, multi-organ failure, or death.

The patient is currently receiving various medications, including diltiazem for SVT, pain management with dilaudid, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. She is also receiving cardiac PO diet and good glucose control."

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic NSCLC, bilateral pulmonary embolism, and recent fasciotomy and closure for left calf compartment syndrome. She has been experiencing episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with blood pressures ranging from 80 to 147 mmHg. The patient's SVT has been managed with adenosine, and she has been prescribed diltiazem 60mg PO q6Hr. She has also been experiencing pain and is receiving dilaudid as needed. The patient has a history of compartment syndrome, pulmonary embolism, and is currently on coumadin for DVT prophylaxis. Her lab results show mild anemia, mild thrombocytopenia, and mild electrolyte imbalance.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's recent surgery and compartment syndrome may have compromised her respiratory function, increasing her risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of SVT and recent episodes may indicate a propensity for cardiac arrhythmias, which could worsen her condition.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and anticoagulation therapy with coumadin may increase her risk of bleeding complications.
4. Infection: The patient's recent surgery and hospitalization may increase her risk of developing an infection, particularly pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent surgery and use of pain medications may increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or constipation.
6. Renal failure: The patient's electrolyte imbalance and potential for bleeding complications may increase her risk of developing acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's compartment syndrome and recent surgery may have compromised her neurological function, increasing her risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, lab results, and clinical condition to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal care."

   add the following points:
   She is doing better with IV esmolol now and has no issues with
   recurrent SVT. She does not tolerate HR when greater than 140 well. She
   is due to have EP evaluation in am [**2188-12-15**]. We will hold
   anticoagulation for this and when cleared start low dose coumadin for

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

Patient Summary:

* The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy.
* She developed bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) in the past and has undergone fasciotomy and closure for left calf compartment syndrome.
* The patient has experienced multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which has resolved with adenosine.
* She is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of SVT and post-operative care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrent SVT: The patient's history of SVT and the presence of SVT on admission increase the risk of recurrent SVT, which can lead to tachycardia, hypertension, and decreased cardiac output.
2. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's history of bilateral PE and recent surgery increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's history of bilateral PE and the presence of PE in the past increase the risk of recurrent PE, which can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death.
4. Compartment Syndrome: The patient's history of left calf compartment syndrome increases the risk of recurrent compartment syndrome, which can lead to tissue necrosis, amputation, and death.
5. Infection: The patient's history of surgery and the presence of IV lines and drains increase the risk of infection, including catheter-related bloodstream infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and surgical site infection.
6. Bleeding: The patient's history of anticoagulation therapy and the presence of IV lines and drains increase the risk of bleeding, including hematemesis, melena, and hematuria.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of bilateral PE and the presence of respiratory failure increase the risk of respiratory failure, including hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
8. Cardiac Failure: The patient's history of bilateral PE and the presence of cardiac failure increase the risk of cardiac failure, including congestive heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest.

Based on the patient's history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her for any signs of these potential medical complications and to adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic NSCLC, who underwent RML lobectomy and chemotherapy. She developed bilateral PE one month ago and was treated with coumadin. Recently, she underwent fasciotomy and closure for L calf compartment syndrome due to a hematoma. She has had multiple episodes of SVT, which resolved with adenosine. Her current condition is characterized by tachycardia, hypertension, and anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may lead to cardiac complications such as atrial fibrillation, cardiac arrhythmias, or even cardiac failure.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of bilateral PE and current tachycardia may increase the risk of pulmonary embolism.
3. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and recent surgery may increase the risk of infection, particularly in the wound site.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia may lead to respiratory failure.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's recent surgery and anesthesia may increase the risk of neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, or cognitive impairment.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent surgery and anesthesia may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, or bowel obstruction.
7. Bleeding complications: The patient's recent surgery and anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of bleeding complications.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's tachycardia and hypertension are being managed with medication and close monitoring. The patient is being treated with diltiazem and lopressor to reduce cardiac workload. The patient's pain is being managed with dilaudid IV. The patient's coumadin is being held and INR is being monitored. The patient's glucose control is being maintained with a cardiac PO diet. The patient is being closely monitored for any signs of infection, respiratory failure, or neurological complications."

   79 yo F with F with history of NSCLC with liver mets with recent
   bilateral PE diagnosis now s/p fasciotomy on [**12-10**] for left calf
   hematoma-related compartment syndrome, transferred to MICU for
   tachycardia and hypotension.
   #  SVT:  Pt has a long hx of SVT. Likely AVNRT. Previously, she was
   always able to manage this with diltiazem and vagal maneuvers. After 7
   episodes of AVRNT yesterday morning, that would briefly convert and
   recur, esmolol gtt was started. This seems to have worked well. HR
   maintained in the 80s. All episodes have been symptomatic.
   - plan for EPS and ablation today
   - cont esmolol gtt
d/c-ed all other BB and CCBs
   -coumadin restarted, INR > 2.0, hold today
s dose in anticipation of
   procedure tomorrw
   -continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   # bilateral PEs: likely secondary to known metastatic malignancy.
   Heparin attempted last night but patient became tachycardic and felt
   hot.  Would recommend to not use heparin in the future.  Restarted
   coumadin which she tolerated well
   - cont coumadin
holding today in the setting of procedure
   - follow INR
   -  Onc OK with coumadin over lovenox evening setting of maligancy
   .
   # L leg compartment syndrome: went to OR for closure, doing well.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer with liver metastases, who was recently diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and underwent fasciotomy for left calf hematoma-related compartment syndrome. She was transferred to the MICU for tachycardia and hypotension. The patient has a long history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and was diagnosed with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). She was treated with esmolol and adenosine, and an electrophysiology study (EPS) and ablation were planned.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 70 bpm and a blood pressure of 100/42 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 100%, and she is on room air. Her respiratory support includes a SpO2 of 100% and an ABG of 26. Her physical examination is limited due to her medical condition, and her labs and radiology reports show stable values.

Potential medical complications:

1. Recurrent SVT: The patient's history of SVT and recent episodes of AVNRT suggest a high risk of recurrent tachycardia, which could lead to cardiac instability and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's recent diagnosis of bilateral PE and her history of metastatic lung cancer increase her risk of recurrent embolism, which could lead to respiratory failure and death.
3. Compartment syndrome: The patient's recent fasciotomy and compartment syndrome in her left calf could lead to further complications, such as nerve damage or infection.
4. Anemia: The patient's normocytic anemia could lead to further complications, such as fatigue, weakness, and decreased immune function.
5. Infection: The patient's recent surgery and medical conditions increase her risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
6. Bleeding: The patient's recent anticoagulation therapy and her history of metastatic cancer increase her risk of bleeding, which could lead to life-threatening complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her cardiac, respiratory, and hemodynamic status to prevent potential complications and ensure her safety and well-being."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with liver metastases, who was recently diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary emboli (PEs) and underwent fasciotomy for left calf hematoma-related compartment syndrome. The patient was admitted to the MICU for tachycardia and hypotension.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37.2°C (98.9°F), Tcurrent 36.6°C (97.9°F), HR 70 bpm (normal range 70-193 bpm), BP 100/42 mmHg (normal range 87/37-164/85 mmHg), RR 16 inspirations per minute (normal range 14-29 inspirations per minute), SpO2 100%.
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm (SR) with successful ablation for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).
* Respiratory support: SpO2 100%, ABG: pH 7.26, PCO2 26 mmHg.
* Physical examination: The patient is lying comfortably, with a distended and tense abdomen, and no peripheral edema.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is 7.7-8.5 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin (Hb) is 9.9-11 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) is 261-304 x 10^9/L, and creatinine (Cr) is 0.8-0.9 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Pulmonary embolism recurrence: Given the patient's history of bilateral PEs, there is a risk of recurrence, which can lead to further respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Compartment syndrome: The patient's history of left calf hematoma-related compartment syndrome and recent fasciotomy may increase the risk of compartment syndrome in other areas of the body, particularly the legs.
3. Anemia: The patient's normocytic anemia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Metastatic disease progression: The patient's NSCLC with liver metastases may progress, leading to further systemic complications and potentially life-threatening outcomes.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's use of anticoagulants and antithrombotic agents may increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly in the setting of compromised platelet function.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and recent surgical procedures may increase the risk of infection, particularly in the respiratory and urinary tracts.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of SVT and recent ablation may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of electrolyte imbalances or medication interactions.

Given these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat any potential complications that may arise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of rapid heart rate. They experienced AVNRT (atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia) overnight, which was treated with adenosine. The patient received 11 doses of adenosine and was subsequently stabilized on esmolol infusion. The plan is to perform an ablation procedure this morning, per the electrophysiology (EP) consultant.

The patient has a history of allergies to morphine, Oxycontin, penicillins, and prednisone. They have also had reactions to codeine and Advair Diskus.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, and blood pressure of 100/42 mmHg. They are receiving esmolol infusion and have a normal sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Their blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and electrolyte levels are within normal limits. However, their troponin-T level is slightly elevated at 0.04 ng/mL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Recurrence of AVNRT or other arrhythmias due to the patient's underlying cardiac condition.
2. Complications from the esmolol infusion, such as hypotension or bradycardia.
3. Constipation due to the patient's recent medication changes and lack of bowel movement.
4. Headache, which may be related to the patient's medication or underlying condition.
5. Development of electrolyte imbalances or acid-base disturbances due to the patient's fluid and medication management.
6. Risk of bleeding or thrombosis due to the patient's recent blood draws and potential need for invasive procedures.
7. Potential for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to the patient's prolonged ICU stay and respiratory support."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, who underwent right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy. She developed bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and later, left calf compartment syndrome, which required fasciotomy and closure. She also experienced two episodes of atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT), which resolved with adenosine. The patient is currently in the ICU, receiving esmolol infusion for rate control and undergoing an electrophysiology (EP) study today.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 73 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 99/48 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy with a nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 99%. Her respiratory support includes a flow rate of 2 L/min and an inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) of 2.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 261 K/uL. Her creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL, and her troponin-T level is 0.04 ng/mL. She has a history of bilateral PE and is currently receiving coumadin with a supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a history of bilateral PE, which may increase the risk of further embolic events.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of AVNRT and the use of esmolol may increase the risk of developing atrial fibrillation.
3. Bleeding Complications: The patient's use of anticoagulant therapy and the risk of bleeding complications, particularly in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and the use of invasive lines and devices may increase the risk of infection.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory support and the risk of developing respiratory failure, particularly in the setting of pulmonary embolism.
6. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's history of AVNRT and the use of esmolol may increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
7. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is mildly elevated, which may indicate underlying kidney dysfunction and increase the risk of renal failure.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's history of compartment syndrome and the risk of developing neurological complications, such as peripheral neuropathy or myopathy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who underwent right middle lobe (RML) lobectomy and chemotherapy. She has bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and is currently in the ICU due to compartment syndrome of the left calf, which required fasciotomy and closure. 

The patient has experienced two episodes of atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) requiring 12 doses of adenosine over the morning. She is currently receiving esmolol infusion and has been restarted on diltiazem 60mg PO tid, which will be increased to q6Hr.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 73 beats per minute, blood pressure of 99/48 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula with a flow rate of 2L. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 261. Her creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL, and her troponin-T level is 0.04 ng/mL. 

The patient's imaging studies show a right-sided effusion on chest X-ray, which has improved since the previous day. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Fluid overload: The patient's right lung crackles may be indicative of fluid overload, which needs to be closely monitored and managed.

2. Bleeding risk: The patient is on coumadin with a supratherapeutic INR, which increases the risk of bleeding.

3. Infection: The patient has a history of bilateral PE and is currently in the ICU, which increases the risk of infection.

4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has experienced two episodes of AVNRT and is currently receiving esmolol infusion, which may not be sufficient to control her cardiac rhythm.

5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, which may indicate early signs of respiratory failure.

6. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL, which may indicate early signs of renal failure.

7. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's compartment syndrome and fasciotomy may increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications.

8. Oncological complications: The patient's metastatic NSCLC may lead to various oncological complications, such as bone metastases, spinal cord compression, or brain metastases."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, s/p right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy, and bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) one month ago. She is currently in the ICU due to post-operative compartment syndrome of the left calf, which required fasciotomy and closure. She also experienced two episodes of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) that resolved with adenosine.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 99/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. Her respiratory support includes an oxygen delivery device with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 2 L. Her physical examination is notable for right lower extremity edema, which is absent, and left lower extremity edema, which is 1+. Her neurologic examination is limited due to her delirious state.

Laboratory results show anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia, but no signs of infection or sepsis. Imaging studies reveal a right pleural effusion that has improved since the previous day. The patient is receiving esmolol infusion and is scheduled for an electrocardiogram (ECG) study today.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary embolism: Given the patient's history of PE, it is essential to monitor her for signs of recurrent embolism, such as sudden onset of shortness of breath, chest pain, or hemoptysis.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's history of AVNRT and the use of esmolol infusion may increase the risk of atrial fibrillation. Close monitoring of her cardiac rhythm is necessary.
3. Infection: Despite the patient's stable laboratory results, she is at risk of developing an infection due to her compromised immune system and the presence of central lines and drains.
4. Bleeding: The patient's use of coumadin and the risk of supratherapeutic INR may increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of her coagulation status is necessary.
5. Neurologic complications: The patient's delirious state and limited neurologic examination may indicate the presence of neurologic complications, such as stroke or seizures. Close monitoring of her neurologic status is necessary.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of metastatic cancer and chemotherapy may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and bowel obstruction. Close monitoring of her gastrointestinal status is necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with liver metastases, who recently underwent bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosis and fasciotomy for left calf hematoma-related compartment syndrome. She was transferred to the MICU for tachycardia and hypotension.

The patient underwent successful ablation for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and was started on metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID. She developed wheezing after the procedure, which was treated with Lasix 20mg IV x 1, and her CXR showed increased vascular congestion.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Tmax: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
* Tcurrent: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* HR: 96 (71-106) bpm
* BP: 131/74 (87) mmHg
* RR: 24 (14-30) inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 99%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 7.7-6.4 K/uL
* Hct: 28.9-28.8%
* Plt: 261-285 K/uL
* Cr: 0.9-0.8 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.04-0.03 ng/mL
* Glucose: 146-109 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 23.4/37.7/2.2, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 296/3/0.03, Differential-Neuts: 80.9%, Lymph: 11.5%, Mono: 5.5%, Eos: 1.9%, Ca++: 8.2 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.7 mg/dL, PO4: 2.4 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Constipation (obstipation, fos)
* Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)
* Headache
* # SVT: Continue low-dose beta-blocker, monitor on telemetry
* # Bilateral PEs: Consider restarting coumadin, follow INR
* # L leg compartment syndrome: Ortho follow-up in 2 weeks, discontinue cefazolin
* # Normocytic anemia: Monitor daily HCTs, transfuse for HCT <24
* # Metastatic NSCLC: Not actively being treated during this hospitalization
* # FEN: IVFs/replete lytes prn/regular diet
* # PPX: PPI, bowel regimen, anticoagulated
* # ACCESS: PIV
* # CODE: Full code
* # CONTACT: Husband
* # DISPO: Discharge to floor

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to increased vascular congestion and wheezing
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to SVT and electrolyte imbalance
* Bleeding due to low platelet count and anticoagulation therapy
* Infection due to immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to constipation and anticoagulation therapy
* Renal failure due to decreased urine output and electrolyte imbalance
* Neurological complications due to metastatic NSCLC and hypoxia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with liver metastases, who was admitted to the ICU with tachycardia and hypotension following a diagnosis of bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). She underwent a fasciotomy for left calf hematoma-related compartment syndrome and was transferred to the ICU.

The patient underwent an ablation procedure for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which was successful according to the EP fellow. She was started on metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID and is being monitored on telemetry.

The patient has a history of constipation, which is being managed with a bowel regimen. She also has a history of headache, which is not specified as related to any underlying condition.

The patient's laboratory results show a normocytic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.3g/dL, and her platelet count is 285 K/uL. Her renal function is within normal limits, with a creatinine level of 0.8mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to her history of bilateral PE and her underlying malignancy.
2. Pneumonia due to her respiratory symptoms and the risk of aspiration.
3. Septic shock due to her history of constipation and the risk of bowel perforation.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias due to her history of SVT and her underlying cardiac disease.
5. Respiratory failure due to her underlying lung disease and the risk of respiratory complications.
6. Infection due to her history of recent surgery and the risk of wound infection.
7. Metastatic disease progression due to her underlying NSCLC and the risk of further spread.

Based on the patient's condition and laboratory results, it is recommended to continue monitoring her closely for any signs of complications and to adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient underwent an ablation procedure yesterday, which was deemed successful by the EP fellow. The patient was prescribed Metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID. However, they experienced wheezing after the procedure, which was attributed to increased vascular congestion on the CXR. Lasix 20mg IV was administered, resulting in a good response.

The patient has a history of allergies to Morphine, Oxycontin, Penicillins, Prednisone, and Codeine. They also have a history of delirium and confusion.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 36.7°C, Tcurrent of 36.6°C, HR of 96 bpm, BP of 131/74 mmHg, RR of 24 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 99%. Their heart rhythm is normal sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results show a WBC count of 7.7, Hct of 32.1, Plt of 261, Cr of 0.9, and TropT of 0.04. Their glucose level is 146. Other lab results include PT / PTT / INR: 23.4/37.7/2.2, CK / CKMB / Troponin-T: 296/3/0.03, and Differential-Neuts: 80.9%.

The patient's assessment and plan include constipation, supraventricular tachycardia, and headache. They are also experiencing [**Last Name 12**] problem, which is not specified in the note.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of wheezing and increased vascular congestion, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's SpO2 level of 99% may indicate early signs of respiratory failure, which could worsen if not addressed promptly.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of supraventricular tachycardia and the presence of other cardiac risk factors may increase the risk of developing other cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Constipation: The patient's constipation may lead to bowel obstruction, which could be a life-threatening complication if not managed promptly.
5. Delirium and confusion: The patient's history of delirium and confusion may increase the risk of developing further cognitive decline or even seizures.
6. Blood clotting disorders: The patient's history of bleeding and the presence of other bleeding risk factors may increase the risk of developing blood clotting disorders, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism."

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy. She has bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and recently underwent elective pulmonary vein ablation (EP ablation) for atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 36.7°C, Tcurrent 36.1°C, HR 96 bpm, BP 132/43 mmHg, RR 21 inspirations per minute, SpO2 95%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving fluids, and her fluid balance is stable.
* Respiratory support: The patient is not receiving oxygen therapy, and her ABG results are normal.
* Physical examination: The patient is well-nourished, with no acute distress. Her cardiovascular examination is normal, and her respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds.
* Lab results: The patient's white blood cell count is 7.7 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin is 9.3 g/dL, and platelet count is 261 x 10^9/L. Her troponin-T level is 0.04 ng/mL, and her CK/CKMB levels are normal.
* Imaging: The patient has pulmonary edema with right effusion, as seen on imaging studies.
* Assessment and plan: The patient's primary diagnosis is AVNRT, and she is receiving metoprolol and follow-up electrocardiogram recommendations. She is also receiving pain management with PO dilaudid, bowel regimen, and orthopedic recommendations.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema with right effusion may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's AVNRT may recur, leading to cardiac arrest or other cardiac complications.
* Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and recent surgical procedures may increase her risk of infection.
* Hemodynamic instability: The patient's fluid balance is stable, but she may experience hemodynamic instability due to her underlying cardiac condition.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema may lead to respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent surgery and pain management may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, or constipation.
* Orthopedic complications: The patient's recent surgery and immobilization may lead to orthopedic complications such as deep vein thrombosis, pressure ulcers, or compartment syndrome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who has undergone right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy. She has also had bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and has recently undergone EP ablation for atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT).

The patient's current condition is stable, with vital signs within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated blood pressure. She is receiving metoprolol and has had a successful EP ablation procedure. Her abdominal pain has resolved, and she is tolerating a regular diet.

The patient has a history of compartment syndrome and has undergone fasciotomy and closure for left calf compartment syndrome. She is also taking coumadin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding: Due to the patient's history of compartment syndrome and recent surgery, she is at risk for bleeding complications, particularly if her platelet count is low.
2. Infection: As the patient has undergone surgery and has a history of pulmonary embolism, she is at risk for developing an infection, particularly in the lungs or urinary tract.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia and recent EP ablation procedure may increase her risk for cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or heart block.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of pulmonary embolism and recent surgery may increase her risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of compartment syndrome and recent surgery may increase her risk for neurological complications, such as nerve damage or stroke.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of abdominal pain and recent surgery may increase her risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or bowel obstruction.
7. Venous thromboembolism: The patient is at risk for developing venous thromboembolism, particularly in the legs, due to her history of pulmonary embolism and recent surgery.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she is at risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, who has undergone right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy, and has bilateral pulmonary embolism. She has undergone fasciotomy and closure for left calf compartment syndrome and has also required EP ablation for atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). She has been admitted to the ICU for post-operative care and management of her conditions.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 132/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -115 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including metoprolol, furosemide, hydromorphone, and H2 blockers. She has also been receiving prophylactic anticoagulation with coumadin.

The patient's physical examination is notable for right lower extremity edema, which is absent. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. Her neurologic examination is normal, with no signs of focal neurological deficits.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dL, platelet count of 261 x 10^9/L, and creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL. Her troponin-T level is 0.04 ng/mL, and her glucose level is 146 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies show pulmonary edema with right effusion, which is consistent with her history of bilateral pulmonary embolism.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and right effusion may lead to respiratory failure, which could require mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and her current medication regimen may increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
3. Infection: The patient's history of bilateral pulmonary embolism and her current antibiotic regimen may increase her risk of infection, particularly pneumonia or sepsis.
4. Thromboembolic events: The patient's history of bilateral pulmonary embolism and her current anticoagulation regimen may increase her risk of thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's history of cancer and her current medication regimen may increase her risk of nutritional deficiencies, such as malnutrition or electrolyte imbalances.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of cancer and her current medication regimen may increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or constipation.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of cancer and her current medication regimen may increase her risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or peripheral neuropathy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy. She has bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and recently underwent fasciotomy and closure for left calf compartment syndrome. The patient also had atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) requiring epicardial ablation.

The patient's current condition is stable, with no further episodes of SVT. She is receiving metoprolol and has been diuresed with improvement. Her abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. The patient is also receiving prophylactic anticoagulation with coumadin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. However, her creatinine level is slightly elevated at 0.9 mg/dL. Her troponin-T level is 0.04 ng/mL, indicating no cardiac damage. Her glucose level is within normal range.

The patient's imaging studies show pulmonary edema with right effusion. Her microbiology results are negative for any new cultures.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and right effusion may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of AVNRT and the use of metoprolol may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's history of bilateral PE and use of coumadin may increase the risk of DVT.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and history of surgery may increase the risk of infection.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulation therapy and history of surgery may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Renal failure: The patient's slightly elevated creatinine level may indicate early signs of renal failure.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's history of surgery and chemotherapy may lead to nutritional deficiencies if not managed properly.
8. Wound complications: The patient's history of surgery and fasciotomy may lead to wound complications if not managed properly.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust her treatment plan as needed to prevent these complications and ensure her optimal recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 79-year-old female with metastatic NSCLC, has been in the ICU for an unknown duration. She underwent EP ablation, fasciotomy, and closure for left calf compartment syndrome, and was treated for bilateral PE. She is currently being treated for AVNRT, and has a history of PE one month ago. She is on coumadin with a supratherapeutic INR, and is scheduled for an EP study today. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, and blood pressure of 132/43 mmHg. Her lab results show a white blood cell count of 7.7, hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 261. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L. Her imaging studies show pulmonary edema with right-sided effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding risk: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to her supratherapeutic INR and recent fasciotomy.
2. Thrombotic risk: The patient's history of PE and use of coumadin increase her risk for thrombosis.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of AVNRT and recent surgery may increase her risk for cardiac complications.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's pulmonary edema and right-sided effusion may increase her risk for respiratory complications.
5. Infection: The patient's recent surgery and use of antibiotics increase her risk for infection.
6. Metastatic disease progression: The patient's metastatic NSCLC may progress, leading to further complications.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's recent surgery and prolonged hospitalization may lead to nutritional deficiencies.
8. Medication interactions: The patient's use of multiple medications may increase her risk for medication interactions.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's INR closely and adjust her anticoagulation therapy as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust her medication regimen as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust her oxygen therapy as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's nutritional status and provide appropriate nutrition support.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medication regimen as needed.
6. Consider transferring the patient to a specialized oncology unit for further management of her metastatic disease.
7. Consider referring the patient to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management of her cardiac status."
