You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 37-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, acid-base disturbance, and hyperkalemia. He was found to have elevated ethylene glycol levels, indicating toxicity. He was treated with bicarbonate, fomepizole, and hemodialysis (HD) with continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). His acid-base disturbance has resolved, and his hyperkalemia improved with HD. He has a history of depression, suicidal ideation, and substance abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he has acute renal failure, which may worsen if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and he has a left upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. He may be at risk for pneumonia, which needs to be ruled out.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which may be due to his underlying condition or medication.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may be due to ethylene glycol toxicity, and he may be at risk for further neurological complications.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient is on anticoagulation therapy, which may increase his risk of bleeding.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of substance abuse and depression may put him at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as constipation or malnutrition.
7. Psychiatric complications: The patient's history of depression and suicidal ideation may require close monitoring and intervention by psychiatric services.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient will continue to receive CVVH until his ethylene glycol levels are less than 20. He will be monitored for electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances. He will also receive antibiotics to cover for pneumonia. The patient's mental status will be closely monitored, and he will be sedated as needed. His cardiac status will be monitored, and he will be treated for atrial fibrillation if necessary. The patient's renal function will be closely monitored, and he will receive IV fluids as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of respiratory failure. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99%, but the ABG results show a pH of 7.38, which may indicate respiratory acidosis.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. The patient's heart rate is 66 beats per minute, which is within the normal range, but the rhythm is irregular.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has hyperkalemia, which may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and other complications. The patient's calcium level is also low, which may increase the risk of muscle weakness and other complications.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient has acute renal failure, which may increase the risk of kidney damage and other complications. The patient's creatinine level is 1.8 mg/dL, which is elevated.
5. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which may indicate infection. The patient's CXR shows a LUL infiltrate, which may indicate pneumonia. The patient is receiving antibiotics, but the infection may not be fully treated.
6. Ethylene glycol toxicity: The patient has ethylene glycol toxicity, which may cause metabolic acidosis and other complications. The patient is receiving treatment, including bicarbonate and fomepizole, but the toxicity may not be fully reversed.
7. Coccaine toxicity: The patient has a history of coccaine abuse, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias and hypertension.
8. Depression: The patient has a history of depression, which may increase the risk of suicidal ideation and other mental health complications.
9. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving nutrition through IV fluids, but the patient may be malnourished due to the underlying medical conditions and the lack of oral intake.

The patient's condition is unstable, and the medical team should closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to ensure that the patient receives appropriate treatment and care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Ethylene glycol toxicity: The patient has been diagnosed with ethylene glycol toxicity, which can lead to metabolic acidosis, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and acute renal failure.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory depression.
3. Acid-base disturbance: The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis, which can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular complications.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and cardiovascular complications.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a rapid ventricular response, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, and cardiovascular complications.
6. Elevated lactate: The patient's lactate level is elevated, which can be a sign of infection, sepsis, or tissue hypoxia.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which can be a sign of infection or inflammation.
8. LUL infiltrate: The patient has a left upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, which can be a sign of pneumonia or aspiration.
9. Coccaine abuse: The patient has a history of coccaine abuse, which can lead to cardiovascular complications, respiratory depression, and psychiatric complications.
10. Depression: The patient has a history of depression, which can lead to suicidal ideation, anxiety, and other psychiatric complications.

Based on the patient's condition, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and there is a risk of cardiac arrest.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate level and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of sepsis.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's LUL infiltrate on chest X-ray suggests the possibility of pneumonia.
5. Aspiration: The patient's LUL infiltrate on chest X-ray suggests the possibility of aspiration.
6. Stroke: The patient's atrial fibrillation and elevated lactate level suggest the possibility of stroke.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hyperkalemia, acid-base disturbance, and atrial fibrillation suggest the possibility of cardiovascular complications.
8. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure and elevated creatinine level suggest the possibility of further renal failure.

Based on the patient's condition, the following treatment recommendations can be made:

1. Continue hemodialysis to manage ethylene glycol toxicity and acute renal failure.
2. Administer calcium and insulin to manage hyperkalemia.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and consider administering beta blockers to manage atrial fibrillation.
4. Administer antibiotics to cover for possible pneumonia or aspiration.
5. Consider sending blood cultures and urine cultures to rule out infection.
6. Monitor the patient's lactate level and leukocytosis to monitor for signs of sepsis.
7. Consider administering stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Consider consulting with nephrology and psychiatry to manage the patient's condition.
9. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubating if necessary.
10. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely and consider administering vasopressors if necessary."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to acute renal failure, altered mental status, and suspected adverse drug event. The patient is receiving invasive ventilation, dialysis catheter, and arterial line for hemodynamic monitoring. They are also receiving various medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, and calcium gluconate.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 66 beats per minute, blood pressure of 123/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation, and their height is 70 inches.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels, indicating acute kidney injury. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hypocalcemia and hyperkalemia.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their critical condition, but they are responding to verbal stimuli and have a regular respiratory pattern.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of acute kidney injury, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and cardiovascular instability.
2. Development of sepsis, given the patient's elevated white blood cell count and suspected bloodstream infection.
3. Respiratory failure, given the patient's need for invasive ventilation and abnormal arterial blood gas results.
4. Cardiovascular instability, given the patient's atrial fibrillation and abnormal blood pressure.
5. Delirium or altered mental status, given the patient's history of altered mental status and potential medication toxicity.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding, given the patient's history of stress ulcer prophylaxis and potential gastrointestinal bleeding risk.
7. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, given the patient's history of prophylactic anticoagulation and potential thrombotic risk.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient has been treated with fomepizole, bicarbonate, and hemodialysis, which has resolved the acidosis and anion gap metabolic acidosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Ethylene glycol toxicity: Continued toxicity can lead to further metabolic acidosis, anion gap, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 2.5 mg/dL, indicating ongoing renal dysfunction. Further monitoring of renal function and consideration of nephrology consultation are necessary.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is 6.0 mEq/L, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels and consideration of potassium supplementation are necessary.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may be related to the ethylene glycol toxicity or other underlying conditions. Further monitoring and consideration of anti-arrhythmic therapy may be necessary.
5. Elevated lactate: The patient's lactate level is elevated, which may be related to the ethylene glycol toxicity or underlying infection. Further evaluation and treatment for potential infection are necessary.
6. Leukocytosis/LUL infiltrate: The patient's leukocytosis and LUL infiltrate may indicate an underlying infection, which requires further evaluation and treatment.
7. UGI bleeding: The patient's NG tube has been bleeding, which may be related to the patient's underlying conditions or the NG tube itself. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary.
8. Coccaine abuse/Depression: The patient's history of cocaine abuse and depression may indicate a need for social work and psychiatry involvement once out of the acute phase.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is currently ICU care."

   Assessment and Plan:  37 y/o gentleman with depression, prior suicidal
   ideation and substance abuse presented with altered mental status.
   .
   # Acid/base disturbance:   Presented with Anion gap metabolic acidosis
   with increased osmolarity to 373 consistent with ethylene glycol
   toxicity.  anion gap  around 30 represent sig metabolism of ethylene
   glycol. Treated w/bicarb, fomepizole Q4h b/c of  CVVH. Anion gap to 12
   this morning and acidosis is resolved after HD and CVVH.  Osmolar gap
   closed
   - CVVH until Ethylene glycol <20
   - monitor electrolytes post d/c CVVH
   - Replete Ca, Mg aggressively
   .
   # Altered Mental status:  Most likely initially due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity, now with sedation overnight for mechanical ventilation.
   Urine shows oxalate crystals.  CT head at OSH did not show any acute
   changes.  LP was within normal limits at OSH.
   - femoral HD line in placd and patient will  continue to receive CVVH
   until EG cleared. [**Month (only) 11**] need HD afterward if UO does not restart
   - ethylene glycol level on presentation 314, trending levels [**Hospital1 **] to TID
   (send to [**Hospital1 1910**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2534**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2535**]). [**11-28**] 3am level was 32.
   -q6h  lytes while on CVVH
   - thiamine 100 mg daily, folic acid 1mg daily and pyridoxine 100mg
   daily
   - fomipezole 10 mg/kg q4h during CVVH
   -continue propofol, weaning as tolerated, titrate for agitation.
   - appreciate toxicology recs
   - appreciate nephrology recs.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  K of 6 with tented T waves on presentation. K improved
   w/HD and correction of academia.
   - to follow lytes after CVVH finished
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  With normal BUN suggestive for intrinsic renal
   disease secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity. Cr stable in low 3s.
   Nephrology following. Given IVF yesterday with lasix 120mg IV with only
   50 cc UO.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - continue CVVH with goal to remove 1L negative today
   - q6h electrolytes check
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  CT head at OSH without sig
   abnormalities and poor quality neck films.
   - switched collar to [**Location (un) 239**]-J until able to clinically clear
   - consider imaging if unable to clinically clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Unclear etiology. Rapid ventricular response
   resolved throughout the night w/sedation, HD, hydration.  B-blocker
   held due to recent cocaine use, holding off on CCB for now given this
   is probably physiologic response to keep his CO adequate.
   - returned to NSR [**11-27**] to [**11-28**]
   - echo
   .
   # Elevated lactate:  Could be falsely elevated due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity.  However given elevated WBC to 40 needs to rule out
   infection.  LP unremarkable as above.  CXR with LUL infiltrate.
   Improved this am when checked w/green top tube, although when checked
   w/abg was stable, slightly elevated. UA w/moderate bacteria but no WBC.
   - Ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover for PNA, most likely aspiration
   - follow BCx
   - follow UCx
   .
   # Leukocytosis/LUL infiltrate:  No bandemia.  LUL CXR as above.  Other
   workup as above.
   - trend with diff
   - CTX and flagyl
   .
   # Coccaine abuse/Depression:
   - will check CK.
   - needs social work and psychiatry involvement once out of acute phase
   .
   #UGI bleeding: blood from NG tube before patient self-d/c.
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - re-place NG, if still w/blood, call GI.
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male who presented with altered mental status, acidosis, and hyperkalemia. The patient was found to have elevated levels of ethylene glycol in his blood, which was likely causing his symptoms.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's heart rate is 83 bpm, and his blood pressure is 133/64 mmHg.
* Neurological: The patient is agitated and not following commands, but he does move all extremities and withdraws from pain.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 3.2 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 14 mg/dL.
* Electrolytes: The patient has hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 6.0 mEq/L.
* Metabolic: The patient has acidosis with a pH level of 7.40 and a bicarbonate level of 25 mEq/L.

The patient's medical history is significant for depression, prior suicidal ideation, and substance abuse. The patient's current medications include fomepizole, propofol, and heparin.

The patient's lab results show the following:

* Complete blood count (CBC): The patient's WBC count is 16.4 x 10^9/L, and his platelet count is 163 x 10^9/L.
* Blood chemistry: The patient's creatinine level is 3.2 mg/dL, his BUN level is 14 mg/dL, and his potassium level is 6.0 mEq/L.
* Electrolytes: The patient's sodium level is 133 mEq/L, his potassium level is 6.0 mEq/L, and his chloride level is 98 mEq/L.
* Blood gases: The patient's pH level is 7.40, his pCO2 level is 40 mmHg, and his pO2 level is 226 mmHg.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which increases his risk of respiratory failure.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's heart rate is 83 bpm, which is slightly elevated, and his blood pressure is 133/64 mmHg, which is slightly elevated.
* Neurological complications: The patient is agitated and not following commands, which may indicate a neurological complication.
* Renal complications: The patient has acute renal failure, which increases his risk of renal complications.
* Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has hyperkalemia, which may require treatment.
* Metabolic complications: The patient has acidosis, which may require treatment.

The patient's potential medical interventions include:

* Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT): The patient's creatinine level is 3.2 mg/dL, which may indicate the need for CRRT.
* Hemodialysis: The patient's BUN level is 14 mg/dL, which may indicate the need for hemodialysis.
* Cardioversion: The patient's heart rate is 83 bpm, which may indicate the need for cardioversion.
* Sedation: The patient is agitated and not following commands, which may require sedation.
* Antibiotics: The patient has a moderate bacteria count in his urine, which may require antibiotics.
* Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient has a history of substance abuse, which may increase his risk of stress ulcer."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Acid/base disturbance:  Anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased
   osmolarity to 373 consistent with ethylene glycol toxicity.  anion gap
   around 30 represent sig metabolism of ethylene glycol. Treated
   w/bicarb, fomepizole Q4h b/c of HD, HD, and CVVH. Anion gap to 14 this
   morning and acidosis is resolved after HD and CVVH.
   - CVVH until Ethylene glycol <20
   - monitor electrolytes post d/c CVVH
   .
   # Altered Mental status:  Most likely initially due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity, now with sedation overnight for mechanical ventilation.
   Urine shows oxalate crystals.  CT head at OSH did not show any acute
   changes.  LP was within normal limits at OSH.
   - femoral HD line is placed and patient will receive HD, may need CVVH
   after that overnight
   - ethylene glycol level is 314, resend the levels post dialysis (send
   to [**Hospital1 1910**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2534**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2535**])
   - need to recheck lytes (gap) and pH post dialysis and give bicarb as
   needed
   - thiamine 100 mg daily, folic acid 50 mg IV q4h and pyridoxine 50 mg
   q6h for 24 hours
   - fomipezole 10 mg/kg q4h during dialysis.
   - IVF prn
   - appreciate toxicology recs
   - appreciate nephrology recs.

   # Hyperkalemia:  K is 6 with tented T waves. K improved w/HD and
   correction of academia.
   - to follow lytes after CVVH finished
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  With normal BUN suggestive for intrinsic renal
   disease secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity. Cr increased to 2.5 this
   am. Nephrology following. Given IVF.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - continue IVF
   - pm electrolytes
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  CT head at OSH without sig
   abnormalities and poor quality neck films.
   - switch collar to [**Location (un) 239**]-J until able to clinically clear
   - consider imaging if unable to clinically clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Unclear etiology. Rapid ventricular response
   resolved throughout the night w/sedation, HD, hydration.  B-blocker
   held due to recent cocaine use, holding off on CCB for now given this
   is probably physiologic response to keep his CO adequate.
   - IVF prn
   - echo
   .
   # Elevated lactate:  Could be falsely elevated due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity.  However given elevated WBC to 40 needs to rule out
   infection.  LP unremarkable as above.  CXR with LUL infiltrate.
   Improved this am when checked w/green top tube, although when checked
   w/abg was stable, slightly elevated. UA w/moderate bacteria but no WBC.
   - Ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover for PNA, most likely aspiration

Summary:

The patient is a 37-year-old male who presented with altered mental status and was found to have ethylene glycol toxicity, leading to an anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased osmolarity. He was treated with bicarbonate, fomepizole, and hemodialysis (HD) and CVVH. His acidosis has been resolved, and his anion gap has decreased.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is 6 with tented T waves, which improved with HD and correction of academia. The patient will need to have his electrolytes followed after CVVH is finished.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has normal BUN, suggesting intrinsic renal disease secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity. His creatinine has increased to 2.5, and nephrology is following his case. He is receiving IV fluids and will need to have his electrolytes followed.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has unclear etiology for his atrial fibrillation, which resolved with sedation, HD, and hydration. His B-blocker was held due to recent cocaine use, and he will need to have an echo to determine the cause of his atrial fibrillation.
4. Elevated lactate: The patient's lactate level is elevated, which could be due to ethylene glycol toxicity or infection. He will need to have a workup for infection, including a CT scan of the head and CXR.
5. Leukocytosis/LUL infiltrate: The patient has a LUL infiltrate on CXR and a white blood cell count of 40. He will need to have a differential count and will be started on antibiotics to cover for pneumonia.
6. UGI bleeding: The patient has blood from his NG tube and will need to have his NG tube replaced if he continues to bleed. He will also need to have his stomach acid level checked.
7. Coccaine abuse/Depression: The patient has a history of cocaine abuse and depression. He will need to have social work and psychiatry involvement once he is out of the acute phase.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
2. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure could progress to chronic renal failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated lactate level and leukocytosis could indicate an infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's UGI bleeding could worsen and lead to hemorrhagic shock.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status could deteriorate if his lung infiltrate worsens or if he develops pneumonia.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's ethylene glycol toxicity could lead to neurological complications, such as seizures or coma.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation could lead to cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-inch tall individual, weighing 96.4 kg, with a current temperature of 36.1°C (97°F) and a heart rate of 83 beats per minute. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50% and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results indicate acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 3.2 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 59 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L, a sodium level of 133 mEq/L, and a chloride level of 98 mEq/L.

The patient's metabolic panel reveals a metabolic acidosis, with a pH of 7.40, a bicarbonate level of 25 mEq/L, and a base excess of -14.8 mEq/L. The patient's liver function tests are also abnormal, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 25 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 14 IU/L.

The patient's coagulation profile is also abnormal, with a prothrombin time (PT) of 13.4 seconds, a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 32.4 seconds, and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.1.

The patient's medical history includes a history of adverse drug events (ADEs), including a history of medication toxicity. The patient's family history is not provided.

The patient's current medications include calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, propofol, and heparin sodium.

Based on the patient's laboratory results and medical history, potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of acute renal failure, potentially leading to end-stage renal disease.
2. Electrolyte imbalances, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
3. Metabolic acidosis, potentially leading to respiratory failure or cardiac arrest.
4. Coagulopathy, potentially leading to bleeding complications.
5. Medication toxicity, potentially leading to further adverse events.
6. Infection, potentially leading to sepsis or organ failure.
7. Respiratory failure, potentially leading to cardiac arrest.
8. Cardiac arrhythmias, potentially leading to cardiac arrest.

In order to manage these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring of their laboratory results, electrolyte levels, and coagulation profile. The patient's medications should be carefully titrated to avoid further adverse events. The patient's fluid status should be closely monitored to avoid fluid overload or dehydration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 37-year-old male who presented with altered mental status, acidosis, and renal failure. He was found to have elevated ethylene glycol levels, which were treated with fomepizole and hemodialysis. He also had hyperkalemia, which improved with hemodialysis and correction of academia. He has a history of depression, substance abuse, and prior suicidal ideation. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and has a femoral dialysis catheter and arterial line.

Potential medical complications:

1. Continued ethylene glycol toxicity: Despite treatment, the patient's ethylene glycol levels have not yet returned to normal, and further treatment may be necessary to prevent long-term sequelae.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and he may require further dialysis to manage his kidney function.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are still slightly elevated, and further monitoring and treatment may be necessary to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and further management will be necessary to wean him off the ventilator.
5. Sepsis: The patient has a history of aspiration and has been treated with antibiotics, but further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to rule out sepsis.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of substance abuse and may be at risk for infections, particularly respiratory and urinary tract infections.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and seizures may be related to ethylene glycol toxicity, and further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to manage these symptoms.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may be related to ethylene glycol toxicity or other underlying conditions, and further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to manage these symptoms.
9. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's ileus and UGI bleeding may be related to his underlying medical conditions and treatment, and further management will be necessary to manage these symptoms.
10. Psychological complications: The patient has a history of depression and substance abuse, and further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to manage these symptoms and prevent long-term psychological sequelae."

   # Acid/base disturbance:  Anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased
   osmolarity to 373 consistent with ethylene glycol toxicity.  anion gap
   around 30 represent sig metabolism of ethylene glycol. Treated
   w/bicarb, fomepizole Q4h b/c of HD, HD, and CVVH. Anion gap to 14 this
   morning and acidosis is resolved after HD and CVVH.
   - CVVH until Ethylene glycol <20
   - monitor electrolytes post d/c CVVH
   .
   # Altered Mental status:  Most likely initially due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity, now with sedation overnight for mechanical ventilation.
   Urine shows oxalate crystals.  CT head at OSH did not show any acute
   changes.  LP was within normal limits at OSH.
   - femoral HD line is placed and patient will receive HD, may need CVVH
   after that overnight
   - ethylene glycol level is 314, resend the levels post dialysis (send
   to [**Hospital1 1910**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2534**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2535**])
   - need to recheck lytes (gap) and pH post dialysis and give bicarb as
   needed
   - thiamine 100 mg daily, folic acid 50 mg IV q4h and pyridoxine 50 mg
   q6h for 24 hours
   - fomipezole 10 mg/kg q4h during dialysis.
   - IVF prn
   - appreciate toxicology recs
   - appreciate nephrology recs.

   # Hyperkalemia:  K is 6 with tented T waves. K improved w/HD and
   correction of academia.
   - to follow lytes after CVVH finished
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  With normal BUN suggestive for intrinsic renal
   disease secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity. Cr increased to 2.5 this
   am. Nephrology following. Given IVF.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - continue IVF
   - pm electrolytes
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  CT head at OSH without sig
   abnormalities and poor quality neck films.
   - switch collar to [**Location (un) 239**]-J until able to clinically clear
   - consider imaging if unable to clinically clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Unclear etiology. Rapid ventricular response
   resolved throughout the night w/sedation, HD, hydration.  B-blocker
   held due to recent cocaine use, holding off on CCB for now given this
   is probably physiologic response to keep his CO adequate.
   - IVF prn
   - echo
   .
   # Elevated lactate:  Could be falsely elevated due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity.  However given elevated WBC to 40 needs to rule out
   infection.  LP unremarkable as above.  CXR with LUL infiltrate.
   Improved this am when checked w/green top tube, although when checked
   w/abg was stable, slightly elevated. UA w/moderate bacteria but no WBC.
   - Ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover for PNA, most likely aspiration
   - follow BCx
   - follow UCx

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient, a 37-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hyperkalemia, acute renal failure, and elevated lactate levels. He has a history of depression, suicidal ideation, and substance abuse. The patient presented with ethylene glycol toxicity, which was confirmed by laboratory tests. He was treated with bicarbonate, fomepizole, and hemodialysis (HD), and his anion gap metabolic acidosis has resolved.

The patient has several ongoing medical conditions, including:

1. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level was elevated, which improved with HD and correction of academia.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has intrinsic renal disease secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity, with a creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dL.
3. Elevated lactate: The patient's lactate level is elevated, which may be falsely elevated due to ethylene glycol toxicity. However, the patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and he has a moderate bacteriuria, which may indicate an infection.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is unclear in etiology, and his rapid ventricular response has resolved with sedation, HD, and hydration.
5. Leukocytosis/LUL infiltrate: The patient has a leukocytosis with no bandemia, and a LUL CXR shows an infiltrate.
6. Coccaine abuse/Depression: The patient has a history of cocaine abuse and depression, and he will require social work and psychiatry involvement once out of the acute phase.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's elevated lactate level and moderate bacteriuria may indicate an infection, which needs to be monitored and treated promptly.
2. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may recur, and he may be at risk for other cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if he develops pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may persist or worsen if he develops a neurological complication, such as a seizure or stroke.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's UGI bleeding may recur if he is not managed properly.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. CVVH until ethylene glycol levels are less than 20.
2. Monitor electrolytes post-dialysis.
3. Give bicarbonate as needed.
4. Continue IVF prn.
5. Follow up with nephrology and toxicology.
6. Consider imaging if unable to clinically clear the patient's cervical spine.
7. Continue anticoagulation therapy.
8. Monitor for signs of infection and treat promptly.
9. Follow up with social work and psychiatry.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory and neurological status."

   Assessment and Plan:  37 y/o gentleman with depression, prior suicidal
   ideation and substance abuse presented with altered mental status.
   .
   # Acid/base disturbance:  Anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased
   osmolarity to 373 consistent with ethylene glycol toxicity.  anion gap
   around 30 represent sig metabolism of ethylene glycol. Treated
   w/bicarb, fomepizole Q4h b/c of HD, HD, and CVVH. Anion gap to 14 this
   morning and acidosis is resolved after HD and CVVH.
   - CVVH until Ethylene glycol <20
   - monitor electrolytes post d/c CVVH
   .
   # Altered Mental status:  Most likely initially due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity, now with sedation overnight for mechanical ventilation.
   Urine shows oxalate crystals.  CT head at OSH did not show any acute
   changes.  LP was within normal limits at OSH.
   - femoral HD line is placed and patient will receive HD, may need CVVH
   after that overnight
   - ethylene glycol level is 314, resend the levels post dialysis (send
   to [**Hospital1 1910**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2534**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2535**])
   - need to recheck lytes (gap) and pH post dialysis and give bicarb as
   needed
   - thiamine 100 mg daily, folic acid 50 mg IV q4h and pyridoxine 50 mg
   q6h for 24 hours
   - fomipezole 10 mg/kg q4h during dialysis.
   - IVF prn
   - appreciate toxicology recs
   - appreciate nephrology recs.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  K is 6 with tented T waves. K improved w/HD and
   correction of academia.
   - to follow lytes after CVVH finished
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  With normal BUN suggestive for intrinsic renal
   disease secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity. Cr increased to 2.5 this
   am. Nephrology following. Given IVF.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - continue IVF
   - pm electrolytes
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  CT head at OSH without sig
   abnormalities and poor quality neck films.
   - switch collar to [**Location (un) 239**]-J until able to clinically clear
   - consider imaging if unable to clinically clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Unclear etiology. Rapid ventricular response
   resolved throughout the night w/sedation, HD, hydration.  B-blocker
   held due to recent cocaine use, holding off on CCB for now given this
   is probably physiologic response to keep his CO adequate.
   - IVF prn
   - echo
   .
   # Elevated lactate:  Could be falsely elevated due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity.  However given elevated WBC to 40 needs to rule out
   infection.  LP unremarkable as above.  CXR with LUL infiltrate.
   Improved this am when checked w/green top tube, although when checked
   w/abg was stable, slightly elevated. UA w/moderate bacteria but no WBC.
   - Ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover for PNA, most likely aspiration
   - follow BCx
   - follow UCx
   .
   # Leukocytosis/LUL infiltrate:  No bandemia.  LUL CXR as above.  Other
   workup as above.
   - trend with diff
   - CTX and flagyl
   .
   # Coccaine abuse/Depression:
   - will check CK.
   - needs social work and psychiatry involvement once out of acute phase

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Acid/base disturbance:  Anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased
   osmolarity to 373 consistent with ethylene glycol toxicity.  anion gap
   around 30 represent sig metabolism of ethylene glycol. Treated
   w/bicarb, fomepizole Q4h b/c of HD, HD, and CVVH. Anion gap to 14 this
   morning and acidosis is resolved after HD and CVVH.
   - CVVH until Ethylene glycol <20
   - monitor electrolytes post d/c CVVH
   .
   # Altered Mental status:  Most likely initially due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity, now with sedation overnight for mechanical ventilation.
   Urine shows oxalate crystals.  CT head at OSH did not show any acute
   changes.  LP was within normal limits at OSH.
   - femoral HD line is placed and patient will receive HD, may need CVVH
   after that overnight
   - ethylene glycol level is 314, resend the levels post dialysis (send
   to [**Hospital1 1910**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2534**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2535**])
   - need to recheck lytes (gap) and pH post dialysis and give bicarb as
   needed
   - thiamine 100 mg daily, folic acid 50 mg IV q4h and pyridoxine 50 mg
   q6h for 24 hours
   - fomipezole 10 mg/kg q4h during dialysis.
   - IVF prn
   - appreciate toxicology recs
   - appreciate nephrology recs.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  K is 6 with tented T waves. K improved w/HD and
   correction of academia.
   - to follow lytes after CVVH finished
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  With normal BUN suggestive for intrinsic renal
   disease secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity. Cr increased to 2.5 this
   am. Nephrology following. Given IVF.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - continue IVF
   - pm electrolytes
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  CT head at OSH without sig
   abnormalities and poor quality neck films.
   - switch collar to [**Location (un) 239**]-J until able to clinically clear
   - consider imaging if unable to clinically clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Unclear etiology. Rapid ventricular response
   resolved throughout the night w/sedation, HD, hydration.  B-blocker
   held due to recent cocaine use, holding off on CCB for now given this
   is probably physiologic response to keep his CO adequate.
   - IVF prn
   - echo
   .
   # Elevated lactate:  Could be falsely elevated due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity.  However given elevated WBC to 40 needs to rule out
   infection.  LP unremarkable as above.  CXR with LUL infiltrate.
   Improved this am when checked w/green top tube, although when checked
   w/abg was stable, slightly elevated. UA w/moderate bacteria but no WBC.
   - Ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover for PNA, most likely aspiration
   - follow BCx
   - follow UCx
   .
   # Leukocytosis/LUL infiltrate:  No bandemia.  LUL CXR as above.  Other
   workup as above.
   - trend with diff
   - CTX and flagyl
   .
   # Coccaine abuse/Depression:
   - will check CK.
   - needs social work and psychiatry involvement once out of acute phase

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male with a complex medical history, including depression, prior suicidal ideation, and substance abuse. He presented with altered mental status, which is likely initially due to ethylene glycol toxicity. The patient has been treated with bicarbonate, fomepizole, and hemodialysis (HD) with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. **Rebound acidosis**: Despite the resolution of acidosis, the patient may experience rebound acidosis due to the rapid correction of acid-base status.
2. **Electrolyte imbalance**: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium, may fluctuate, leading to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
3. **Renal injury**: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease if not managed properly.
4. **Infection**: The patient's leukocytosis and LUL infiltrate may indicate a potential infection, which needs to be ruled out and treated promptly.
5. **Cocaine withdrawal**: The patient's history of cocaine abuse may lead to withdrawal symptoms, including anxiety, agitation, and cardiovascular instability.
6. **Depression**: The patient's depression may worsen during his hospitalization, requiring close monitoring and psychiatric intervention.
7. **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: The patient's UGI bleeding may recur, requiring further evaluation and treatment.
8. **Pulmonary complications**: The patient's respiratory support may lead to pulmonary complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or respiratory failure.
9. **Cardiac arrhythmias**: The patient's atrial fibrillation may persist or worsen, requiring further treatment and monitoring.
10. **Nutritional deficiencies**: The patient's NPO status may lead to nutritional deficiencies, particularly vitamin and mineral deficiencies, which need to be monitored and addressed.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these potential complications and ensure optimal care."

 .H/O ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC:  Lactic acidosis and AG have normalized.
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
   Ethlyene glycol intoxication:  osmolar gap is down to 4, but will
   continue fomepizole until level is <20 as if it is fat soluble, it may
   still be present and leach out.  Await 3:00AM level, if high, recheck,
   if <20, can stop fomepizole.
   Rigidity:  Unclear if this was agitation.   He was also on a  muscle
   relaxant which has been stopped - this can cause withdrawl.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF):  Will continue CVVH
   for now to remove fluid.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 .H/O ADVERSE DRUG EVENT (ADR, ADE, MEDICATION TOXICITY)
 .H/O ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC:  Lactic acidosis and AG have normalized.
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
   Ethlyene glycol intoxication:  osmolar gap is down to 4, but will
   continue fomepizole until level is <20 as if it is fat soluble, it may
   still be present and leach out.  Await 3:00AM level, if high, recheck,
   if <20, can stop fomepizole.
   Rigidity:  Unclear if this was agitation.   He was also on a  muscle
   relaxant which has been stopped - this can cause withdrawl.

   Total time spent: 40 minutes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU due to ethylene glycol intoxication. He has been receiving treatment with fomepizole, calcium gluconate, and other medications to manage his condition.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 158/106 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 99% on a ventilator.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and lactate, indicating acute kidney injury and metabolic acidosis. His blood glucose level is 124 mg/dL, and his calcium level is 8.0 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination is notable for altered mental status, with the patient being non-attentive and non-following simple commands. He responds to verbal stimuli and has non-purposeful movement.

The patient's imaging studies show no evidence of acute injury or bleeding.

The patient's assessment and plan include continued treatment with fomepizole and calcium gluconate to manage his ethylene glycol intoxication. He will also continue to receive CVVH to remove fluid and electrolytes. The patient's altered mental status is being monitored, and he will be assessed for potential withdrawal from muscle relaxants.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Continued kidney injury and failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and metabolic acidosis suggest ongoing kidney damage. Further monitoring and treatment will be necessary to prevent or manage kidney failure.
2. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's elevated potassium and lactate levels may lead to further electrolyte imbalances if not properly managed. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels and administration of electrolyte supplements as needed will be necessary.
3. Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen if not properly managed. Treatment with bicarbonate or other alkalizing agents may be necessary to maintain a normal acid-base balance.
4. Muscle weakness: The patient's altered mental status and non-purposeful movement may be related to muscle weakness or paralysis. Further evaluation and treatment will be necessary to determine the cause of these symptoms and to manage them effectively.
5. Infection: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and use of invasive lines and catheters increase his risk of developing infections. Close monitoring for signs of infection and prompt treatment will be necessary to prevent or manage infections.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant medications and his altered mental status increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring for signs of bleeding and prompt treatment will be necessary to prevent or manage bleeding.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's continued use of a ventilator and his altered mental status increase his risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and prompt treatment will be necessary to prevent or manage respiratory failure."

   Assessment and Plan:  37 y/o gentleman with depression, prior suicidal
   ideation and substance abuse presented with altered mental status.
   .
   # Acid/base disturbance:   Presented with Anion gap metabolic acidosis
   with increased osmolarity to 373 consistent with ethylene glycol
   toxicity.  anion gap  around 30 represent sig metabolism of ethylene
   glycol. Treated w/bicarb, fomepizole Q4h b/c of  CVVH. Anion gap to 12
   this morning and acidosis is resolved after HD and CVVH.  Osmolar gap
   closed
   - CVVH until Ethylene glycol <20
   - monitor electrolytes post d/c CVVH
   - Replete Ca, Mg aggressively
   .
   # Altered Mental status:  Most likely initially due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity, now with sedation overnight for mechanical ventilation.
   Urine shows oxalate crystals.  CT head at OSH did not show any acute
   changes.  LP was within normal limits at OSH.
   - femoral HD line in placd and patient will  continue to receive CVVH
   until EG cleared. [**Month (only) 11**] need HD afterward if UO does not restart
   - ethylene glycol level on presentation 314, trending levels [**Hospital1 **] to TID
   (send to [**Hospital1 1910**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2534**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2535**]). [**11-28**] 3am level was 32.
   -q6h  lytes while on CVVH
   - thiamine 100 mg daily, folic acid 1mg daily and pyridoxine 100mg
   daily
   - fomipezole 10 mg/kg q4h during CVVH
   -continue propofol, weaning as tolerated, titrate for agitation.
   - appreciate toxicology recs
   - appreciate nephrology recs.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  K of 6 with tented T waves on presentation. K improved
   w/HD and correction of academia.
   - to follow lytes after CVVH finished
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  With normal BUN suggestive for intrinsic renal
   disease secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity. Cr stable in low 3s.
   Nephrology following. Given IVF yesterday with lasix 120mg IV with only
   50 cc UO.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - continue CVVH with goal to remove 1L negative today
   - q6h electrolytes check
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  CT head at OSH without sig
   abnormalities and poor quality neck films.
   - switched collar to [**Location (un) 239**]-J until able to clinically clear
   - consider imaging if unable to clinically clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Unclear etiology. Rapid ventricular response
   resolved throughout the night w/sedation, HD, hydration.  B-blocker
   held due to recent cocaine use, holding off on CCB for now given this
   is probably physiologic response to keep his CO adequate.
   - returned to NSR [**11-27**] to [**11-28**]
   - echo: [**11-27**], Preserved regional and global biventricular systolic
   function. No structural valvular disease.
   .
   # Elevated WBC:  Elevated lactate Could be falsely elevated due to
   ethylene glycol toxicity, lactate level now normal.  However given
   elevated WBC to 40 needs to rule out infection.  LP unremarkable as
   above.  CXR with LUL infiltrate. UA w/moderate bacteria but no WBC.
   - Ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover for PNA, most likely aspiration to
   complete a 5 day course
   - follow BCx
   - follow UCx
   .
   # Leukocytosis/LUL infiltrate:  No bandemia.  LUL CXR as above.  Other
   workup as above.
   - trend with diff
   - CTX and flagyl
   .
   # Coccaine abuse/Depression:
   - CK now normal at 155.
   - needs social work and psychiatry involvement once out of acute phase
   .
   #UGI bleeding: blood from NG tube before patient self-d/c.  None since
   first day of admission
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - OG was placed
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now, when has BM and concern for ileus resolves get
   nutrition consult for TF
   .
   # Prophylaxis:  sc heparin, pneumoboots, [**Hospital1 **] PPI, BM reg
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # Acid/base disturbance:   Presented with Anion gap metabolic acidosis
   with increased osmolarity to 373 consistent with ethylene glycol
   toxicity.  anion gap  around 30 represent sig metabolism of ethylene
   glycol. Treated w/bicarb, fomepizole Q4h b/c of  CVVH. Anion gap to 12
   this morning and acidosis is resolved after HD and CVVH.  Osmolar gap
   closed
   - CVVH until Ethylene glycol <20
   - monitor electrolytes post d/c CVVH
   - Replete Ca, Mg aggressively
   .
   # Altered Mental status:  Most likely initially due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity, now with sedation overnight for mechanical ventilation.
   Urine shows oxalate crystals.  CT head at OSH did not show any acute
   changes.  LP was within normal limits at OSH.
   - femoral HD line in placd and patient will  continue to receive CVVH
   until EG cleared. [**Month (only) 11**] need HD afterward if UO does not restart
   - ethylene glycol level on presentation 314, trending levels [**Hospital1 **] to TID
   (send to [**Hospital1 1910**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2534**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2535**]). [**11-28**] 3am level was 32.
   -q6h  lytes while on CVVH
   - thiamine 100 mg daily, folic acid 1mg daily and pyridoxine 100mg
   daily
   - fomipezole 10 mg/kg q4h during CVVH
   -continue propofol, weaning as tolerated, titrate for agitation.
   - appreciate toxicology recs
   - appreciate nephrology recs.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  K of 6 with tented T waves on presentation. K improved
   w/HD and correction of academia.
   - to follow lytes after CVVH finished
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  With normal BUN suggestive for intrinsic renal
   disease secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity. Cr stable in low 3s.
   Nephrology following. Given IVF yesterday with lasix 120mg IV with only
   50 cc UO.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - continue CVVH with goal to remove 1L negative today
   - q6h electrolytes check
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  CT head at OSH without sig
   abnormalities and poor quality neck films.
   - switched collar to [**Location (un) 239**]-J until able to clinically clear
   - consider imaging if unable to clinically clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Unclear etiology. Rapid ventricular response
   resolved throughout the night w/sedation, HD, hydration.  B-blocker
   held due to recent cocaine use, holding off on CCB for now given this
   is probably physiologic response to keep his CO adequate.
   - returned to NSR [**11-27**] to [**11-28**]
   - echo: [**11-27**], Preserved regional and global biventricular systolic
   function. No structural valvular disease.
   .
   # Elevated WBC:  Elevated lactate Could be falsely elevated due to
   ethylene glycol toxicity, lactate level now normal.  However given
   elevated WBC to 40 needs to rule out infection.  LP unremarkable as
   above.  CXR with LUL infiltrate. UA w/moderate bacteria but no WBC.
   - Ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover for PNA, most likely aspiration to
   complete a 5 day course
   - follow BCx
   - follow UCx
   .
   # Leukocytosis/LUL infiltrate:  No bandemia.  LUL CXR as above.  Other
   workup as above.
   - trend with diff
   - CTX and flagyl
   .
   # Coccaine abuse/Depression:
   - CK now normal at 155.
   - needs social work and psychiatry involvement once out of acute phase
   .
   #UGI bleeding: blood from NG tube before patient self-d/c.  None since
   first day of admission
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - OG was placed

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male who presented with altered mental status, hyperkalemia, and acute renal failure. He was found to have elevated ethylene glycol levels, which was treated with bicarbonate, fomepizole, and CVVH. The patient's acid-base disturbance was resolved, and his anion gap decreased to 12.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels were elevated on presentation, but improved with hemodialysis and correction of academia. It is essential to follow electrolyte levels after CVVH is finished.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has normal BUN, but his creatinine levels are stable in the low 3s, suggesting intrinsic renal disease secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity. Nephrology is following the patient, and CVVH will continue with the goal of removing 1L of fluid per day.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's rapid ventricular response was resolved with sedation, HD, and hydration. The etiology of atrial fibrillation is unclear, and the patient's b-blocker was held due to recent cocaine use. The patient's CO was kept adequate by holding off on CCB.
4. Leukocytosis/LUL infiltrate: The patient has an elevated WBC count, which may be falsely elevated due to ethylene glycol toxicity. However, given the elevated WBC, infection cannot be ruled out. A CXR showed LUL infiltrate, and UA was moderate with bacteria but no WBC. The patient is receiving antibiotics to cover for PNA, and follow-up CXR and UA are planned.
5. UGI bleeding: The patient had blood from the NG tube before self-extubation. None has been seen since the first day of admission. The patient is receiving PPI and OG was placed.
6. FEN: The patient is NPO for now, and when he has a bowel movement and concern for ileus resolves, a nutrition consult will be obtained for TF.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving sc heparin, pneumoboots, and PPI, as well as BM regimens.

The patient's current medications include:

* Propofol
* Fomepizole
* Thiamine
* Folic acid
* Pyridoxine
* Lasix
* Ceftriaxone
* Metronidazole
* Pantoprazole
* Heparin sodium

The patient's code status is full code. His contact information is listed as Sister [**Name (NI) 107**] and Mother [**Name (NI) 141**].

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but he requires close monitoring and management of his potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of poisoning/overdose, acute renal failure, altered mental status, and adverse drug event. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and a PEEP of 10 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, and blood pressure of 101/60 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support is being weaned, with a decrease in Fio2 from 50 to 40% and a decrease in RR from 28 to 16 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 4.5 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 26 mEq/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.5 mg/dL and a magnesium level of 2.7 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 25 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 14 IU/L.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level of 4.5 mg/dL and BUN level of 26 mEq/L indicate acute kidney injury. This could lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and acidosis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's need for mechanical ventilation and weaning from FiO2 suggests respiratory failure. This could lead to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
3. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's abnormal electrolyte levels, including potassium and magnesium, could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's abnormal liver function tests, including AST and ALT, could indicate liver dysfunction. This could lead to coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and other complications.
5. Acidosis: The patient's abnormal anion gap and lactate level could indicate metabolic acidosis. This could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
6. Infection: The patient's presence in the ICU and use of invasive lines and catheters increase the risk of infection. This could lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
7. Adverse drug event: The patient's history of adverse drug event and use of multiple medications increase the risk of adverse drug reactions. This could lead to organ failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and death."

   # Acid/base disturbance:   Presented with Anion gap metabolic acidosis
   with increased osmolarity to 373 consistent with ethylene glycol
   toxicity.  Osmole gap resolved, electrolytes normalized and EG levels
   below 20 yesterday so CVVHD and fomepizole stopped. Creatinine however
   continues to rise and he will likely need HD as this is probably and
   intrarenal problem caused by ethylene glycol.
   - HD today
   - monitor electrolytes (labs drawn during HD)
   - f/u renal recs
   -f/u toxicology recs
   -caution with IVF as patient appears clinically fluid overloaded.
   # Altered Mental status:  Likely due to toxicity, although patient was
   also taking a number of pain and psych meds including percocet.  CT
   head and LP at OSH did not show any acute changes.  Currently on
   Propofol drip with intermittent episodes of agitation with weaning.
   Will continue to wean off Propofol as tolerated with hopes of
   extubation if successful.
   -          HD today
   -          Continue to wean Propofol as tolerated
   -          Patient will likely need psych consult and sitter when
   conscious
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  resolved, on HD today
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Making very little urine and Cr steadily
   increasing, intrinsic renal is the key issue. Renal service feels
   patient would benefit from HD today both for renal failure and volume
   overload. Will continue to follow electrolytes and replete as needed
   with HD. Given patient is on Propofol will need to monitor closely for
   hypotension during HD.
   - follow nephrology recs
   - monitor electrolytes and follow Cr for improvement
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  Will wean of sedation will
   clinically clear prior to removal.
   - consider imaging if unable to clinically clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm with
   stable rates. Echo does not show structural abnormalities.
   .
   # Elevated WBC:  Trending down nicely. Low grade fever on occasion over
   the last 2 days but otherwise no clear indication of worsening
   infection. Currently on ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover for LUL
   infiltrate ?PNA, most likely aspiration to complete a 5 day course
   - follow BCx
   - follow UCx
   -trend fever curve

   # Coccaine abuse/Depression:
   -          social work following, appreciate recs and support
   -          will need psych

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, likely due to ethylene glycol toxicity. He has undergone several interventions, including CVVHD, fomepizole, and propofol drip.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: He is intubated and on a ventilator, with a FiO2 of 50% and a PEEP of 10 cmH2O.
* Cardiovascular: His blood pressure is 101/60 mmHg, and his heart rhythm is sinus rhythm with occasional PVCs.
* Neurological: He is sedated and not following commands, but he does respond to painful stimuli.
* Renal: His creatinine level is increasing, and he is making very little urine. He is likely to need hemodialysis (HD) today.
* Electrolytes: His potassium level is elevated, but it has resolved. He will need to be monitored for electrolyte imbalances during HD.
* Infection: He has a low-grade fever and is on antibiotics to cover for a possible LUL infiltrate or aspiration pneumonia.
* UGI bleeding: He is experiencing bilious drainage from his OG tube, but it is not bloody. He will need to have his OG tube clamped and monitored.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Acute renal failure, which is likely due to intrinsic renal failure caused by ethylene glycol toxicity.
* Hyperkalemia, which has resolved but may recur during HD.
* Infection, such as pneumonia or LUL infiltrate, which could worsen his condition.
* UGI bleeding, which could lead to hemorrhage or perforation.
* Fluid overload, which could lead to pulmonary edema or cardiac failure.
* Sedation-related complications, such as hypotension or respiratory depression.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* HD today to manage his acute renal failure and fluid overload.
* Weaning off propofol as tolerated, with the goal of extubation if successful.
* Monitoring his electrolytes and repleting as needed during HD.
* Following up with nephrology and toxicology consultations.
* Considering a psych consultation and sitter when the patient becomes conscious.
* Monitoring his UGI bleeding and adjusting his treatment as needed.
* Following up with social work and nutrition consultations to address his depression and nutritional needs."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Patient Condition:**

* The patient is a 37-year-old male with ethylene glycol ingestion who has been admitted to the ICU.
* He has developed respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and is at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
* His laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, electrolyte imbalances, and abnormal blood chemistry values.
* He has a PICC line, arterial line, and dialysis catheter in place.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Aspiration Pneumonia:** The patient's risk of aspiration pneumonia is high due to his intubation and the presence of a NG tube. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and prompt treatment of any respiratory symptoms are crucial.
2. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI):** The patient's AKI may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly. Close monitoring of his renal function and adjustment of his fluid management and dialysis therapy are essential.
3. **Electrolyte Imbalances:** The patient's electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications. Close monitoring of his electrolyte levels and adjustment of his electrolyte replacement therapy are necessary.
4. **Coagulopathy:** The patient's elevated INR and PTT values suggest a coagulopathy. Close monitoring of his coagulation status and adjustment of his anticoagulation therapy are crucial to prevent bleeding complications.
5. **Infection:** The patient is at risk for infection due to his intubation, NG tube, and dialysis catheter. Close monitoring of his temperature, white blood cell count, and other laboratory values is necessary to detect any signs of infection.
6. **C-spine Injury:** The patient's neck brace suggests that he may have a C-spine injury. Close monitoring of his spinal stability and adjustment of his neck immobilization are necessary to prevent further injury.
7. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient's NPO status and presence of a NG tube suggest that he may be at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Close monitoring of his gastrointestinal symptoms and adjustment of his medication therapy are necessary to prevent these complications.

**Plan:**

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his respiratory therapy as necessary.
* Continue to manage his acute kidney injury with dialysis therapy and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
* Monitor his electrolyte levels and adjust his electrolyte replacement therapy as necessary.
* Monitor his coagulation status and adjust his anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
* Monitor his temperature, white blood cell count, and other laboratory values to detect any signs of infection.
* Continue to monitor his C-spine stability and adjust his neck immobilization as necessary.
* Monitor his gastrointestinal symptoms and adjust his medication therapy as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan:  37 y/o gentleman with depression, prior suicidal
   ideation and substance abuse presented with altered mental status.
   .
   # Acid/base disturbance:   Resolved.  Presented with Anion gap
   metabolic acidosis with increased osmolarity to 373 consistent with
   ethylene glycol toxicity.  Osmol gap resolved, electrolytes normalized
   and EG levels below 20 so CVVHD and fomepizole stopped. Creatinine
   however continues to rise and he will likely need HD as this is
   probably and intrarenal problem caused by ethylene glycol.
   - nephrology following
   - f/u renal recs - HD tomorrow?
   - monitor electrolytes (labs drawn during HD)
   - caution with IVF as patient appears clinically fluid overloaded.
   # Altered Mental status:  Likely due to toxicity, although patient was
   also taking a number of pain and psych meds including percocet.  CT
   head and LP at OSH did not show any acute changes.  Currently weaning
   Propofol drip with intermittent episodes of agitation and increased
   responsiveness (as per nursing staff) with weaning. Will continue to
   wean off Propofol as tolerated with hopes of extubation today if
   successful.
   -          HD today
   -          Continue to wean Propofol as tolerated
   -          Restraints by bedside
   -          Haldol prn agitation
   -          Patient will need psych consult and sitter when conscious
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Making very little urine and Cr steadily
   increasing, intrinsic renal is the key issue. Renal service feels
   patient would benefit from ongoing HD today both for renal failure and
   volume overload. Will continue to follow electrolytes and replete as
   needed with HD.
   - speak w/nephrology RE likely long-term need for dialysis
   - monitor electrolytes and follow Cr for improvement
   .
   # Aspiration pneumonia:  Aspiration pneumonia on cxr, c/w history, elev
   WBC, low grade temps.  WBC trending down. Low grade fever on occasion
   over the last 3 days could be due to resolving pna or UTI (see below).
   Was on ceftriaxone and flagyl to but switched to levoquin while pt on
   CVVH and receiving frequent doses of IV calcium b/c Ceftriaxone
   precipitates with calcium. CVVH d/c now, so can re-start Ceftriaxone,
   which may cover UTI better.
   - d/c flagyl, do not need to cover anaerobes in setting of new
   aspiration pneumonia.
   - follow BCx
   - follow CXR
   - trend fever curve
   # Positive UA: Has foley since admission. Has been febrile on Levoquin,
   Flagyl. To change antibiotics to Ceftriaxone, may cover UTI better.
   - follow UCx, tailor antibiotics based on results.
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  Will wean of sedation will
   clinically clear prior to removal.
   - consider imaging if unable to clinically clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm with
   stable rates. Echo does not show structural abnormalities.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  resolved
   .
   # Cocaine abuse/Depression:
   -          social work following, appreciate recs and support
   -          will need psych when extubateed
   .
   #UGI bleeding: OG to suction was bringing back bilious drainage; On
   PPI. Has not had any bloody drainage. Clamped yesterday w/out problem.
   - [**Hospital1 **] to QD
   - OG to clamp
   - to monitor
   .
   # FEN:  Has been NPO for 3 days. OG clamped.  PO when extubated as
   mental status allows.  Replete electrolytes. Will need to consult
   nutrition if patient is not able to be extubated or taking OG feeds by
   tomorrow.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, suspected ethylene glycol toxicity, and acute renal failure. He has a history of depression, suicidal ideation, and substance abuse.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 101.1°F, blood pressure 156/81 mmHg, heart rate 88 bpm, respiratory rate 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%.
* Respiratory support: Endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV mode, and FiO2 50%.
* Neurological status: Sedated, not following commands, and moving all extremities.
* Laboratory results: WBC 11.7, Hct 29.6, Plt 185, Cr 4.0, and electrolytes within normal range.
* Radiology: CT head and LP at OSH did not show any acute changes.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Ethylene glycol toxicity: Resolved, but creatinine continues to rise, and he will likely need HD as an intrarenal problem.
* Altered mental status: Likely due to toxicity, but also taking pain and psych meds, including percocet.
* Acute renal failure: Making very little urine and creatinine steadily increasing, intrinsic renal is the key issue.
* Aspiration pneumonia: Aspiration pneumonia on CXR, c/w history, elevated WBC, and low-grade temps.
* Positive UA: Has foley since admission, febrile on Levoquin, and Flagyl.
* s/p fall: Currently on hard collar, will wean off sedation before removal.
* Atrial fibrillation: Spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm with stable rates.
* Hyperkalemia: Resolved.
* UGI bleeding: OG to suction bringing back bilious drainage, on PPI.
* FEN: NPO for 3 days, OG clamped, and PO when extubated as mental status allows.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Increased risk of respiratory failure due to continued use of propofol and weaning off sedation.
* Risk of further renal damage due to continued intrarenal problem and potential need for long-term dialysis.
* Risk of infection due to aspiration pneumonia and positive UA.
* Risk of bleeding due to UGI bleeding and continued use of anticoagulants.
* Risk of further electrolyte imbalance due to continued use of IV fluids and medications.

The plan of care includes:

* Weaning off propofol and sedation as tolerated.
* Continuing HD as needed for renal failure and volume overload.
* Monitoring electrolytes and repleting as needed.
* Following UCx and tailoring antibiotics based on results.
* Considering imaging if unable to clinically clear the hard collar.
* Consultation with nephrology, psych, and nutrition services as needed.
* Monitoring for signs of respiratory failure, infection, bleeding, and further electrolyte imbalance."

   # Acid/base disturbance:   Presented with Anion gap metabolic acidosis
   with increased osmolarity to 373 consistent with ethylene glycol
   toxicity.  Osmole gap resolved, electrolytes normalized and EG levels
   below 20 yesterday so CVVHD and fomepizole stopped. Creatinine however
   continues to rise and he will likely need HD as this is probably and
   intrarenal problem caused by ethylene glycol.
   - HD today
   - monitor electrolytes (labs drawn during HD)
   - f/u renal recs
   -f/u toxicology recs
   -caution with IVF as patient appears clinically fluid overloaded.
   # Altered Mental status:  Likely due to toxicity, although patient was
   also taking a number of pain and psych meds including percocet.  CT
   head and LP at OSH did not show any acute changes.  Currently on
   Propofol drip with intermittent episodes of agitation with weaning.
   Will continue to wean off Propofol as tolerated with hopes of
   extubation if successful.
   -          HD today
   -          Continue to wean Propofol as tolerated
   -          Patient will likely need psych consult and sitter when
   conscious
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  resolved, on HD today
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Making very little urine and Cr steadily
   increasing, intrinsic renal is the key issue. Renal service feels
   patient would benefit from HD today both for renal failure and volume
   overload. Will continue to follow electrolytes and replete as needed
   with HD. Given patient is on Propofol will need to monitor closely for
   hypotension during HD.
   - follow nephrology recs
   - monitor electrolytes and follow Cr for improvement
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  Will wean of sedation will
   clinically clear prior to removal.
   - consider imaging if unable to clinically clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm with
   stable rates. Echo does not show structural abnormalities.
   .
   # Elevated WBC:  Trending down nicely. Low grade fever on occasion over
   the last 2 days but otherwise no clear indication of worsening
   infection. Currently on ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover for LUL
   infiltrate ?PNA, most likely aspiration to complete a 5 day course
   - follow BCx
   - follow UCx
   -trend fever curve
   .
   # Coccaine abuse/Depression:
   -          social work following, appreciate recs and support
   -          will need psych
   .
   #UGI bleeding: currently OG to suction bringing back bilious drainage;
   On PPI. Has not had any bloody drainage. Will clamp and today and give
   something from below.
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - OG to clamp
   -monitor
   .
   # FEN:  Has been NPO for 3 days. Will clamp OG and watch for BM and
   movement from below.  This way we can feel comfortable giving PO.
   Replete electrolytes. Will need to consult nutrition if patient is not
   able to be extubated or taking OG feeds by tomorrow.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan:  37 y/o gentleman with depression, prior suicidal
   ideation and substance abuse presented with altered mental status.
   .
   # Acid/base disturbance:   Presented with Anion gap metabolic acidosis
   with increased osmolarity to 373 consistent with ethylene glycol
   toxicity.  Osmole gap resolved, electrolytes normalized and EG levels
   below 20 yesterday so CVVHD and fomepizole stopped. Creatinine however
   continues to rise and he will likely need HD as this is probably and
   intrarenal problem caused by ethylene glycol.
   - HD today
   - monitor electrolytes (labs drawn during HD)
   - f/u renal recs
   -f/u toxicology recs
   -caution with IVF as patient appears clinically fluid overloaded.
   # Altered Mental status:  Likely due to toxicity, although patient was
   also taking a number of pain and psych meds including percocet.  CT
   head and LP at OSH did not show any acute changes.  Currently on
   Propofol drip with intermittent episodes of agitation with weaning.
   Will continue to wean off Propofol as tolerated with hopes of
   extubation if successful.
   -          HD today
   -          Continue to wean Propofol as tolerated
   -          Patient will likely need psych consult and sitter when
   conscious
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  resolved, on HD today
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Making very little urine and Cr steadily
   increasing, intrinsic renal is the key issue. Renal service feels
   patient would benefit from HD today both for renal failure and volume
   overload. Will continue to follow electrolytes and replete as needed
   with HD. Given patient is on Propofol will need to monitor closely for
   hypotension during HD.
   - follow nephrology recs
   - monitor electrolytes and follow Cr for improvement
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  Will wean of sedation will
   clinically clear prior to removal.
   - consider imaging if unable to clinically clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm with
   stable rates. Echo does not show structural abnormalities.
   .
   # Elevated WBC:  Trending down nicely. Low grade fever on occasion over
   the last 2 days but otherwise no clear indication of worsening
   infection. Currently on ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover for LUL
   infiltrate ?PNA, most likely aspiration to complete a 5 day course
   - follow BCx
   - follow UCx
   -trend fever curve
   .
   # Coccaine abuse/Depression:
   -          social work following, appreciate recs and support
   -          will need psych
   .
   #UGI bleeding: currently OG to suction bringing back bilious drainage;
   On PPI. Has not had any bloody drainage. Will clamp and today and give
   something from below.
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - OG to clamp
   -monitor
   .
   # FEN:  Has been NPO for 3 days. Will clamp OG and watch for BM and
   movement from below.  This way we can feel comfortable giving PO.
   Replete electrolytes. Will need to consult nutrition if patient is not
   able to be extubated or taking OG feeds by tomorrow.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, likely due to ethylene glycol toxicity. The patient has undergone several interventions, including hemodialysis, fomepizole, and propofol drip. The patient's condition is currently stable, but there are several potential medical complications that could arise:

1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level continues to rise, indicating ongoing renal failure. The patient will likely require further hemodialysis and close monitoring of electrolytes.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is negative, indicating fluid overload. This could lead to pulmonary edema, heart failure, or other complications.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia. Close monitoring and correction of electrolyte imbalances are necessary.
4. Infection: The patient has a low-grade fever and is receiving antibiotics for possible pneumonia or aspiration. Close monitoring of infection markers and antibiotic therapy are necessary.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has undergone upper gastrointestinal bleeding and is receiving proton pump inhibitor therapy. Close monitoring of bleeding and electrolyte levels is necessary.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of respiratory status and weaning from the ventilator are necessary.
7. Psychiatric complications: The patient has a history of depression and substance abuse. Close monitoring of psychiatric status and consideration of psychiatric consultation are necessary.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and may be at risk for further cardiac complications.

Based on these potential complications, the patient's care plan should include:

1. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte levels.
2. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels.
3. Continued antibiotic therapy for possible infection.
4. Close monitoring of gastrointestinal bleeding and electrolyte levels.
5. Weaning from the ventilator and close monitoring of respiratory status.
6. Psychiatric consultation and close monitoring of psychiatric status.
7. Cardiovascular monitoring and consideration of cardiac consultation.

Overall, the patient's care plan should prioritize close monitoring of the patient's condition and early intervention to prevent or manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-inch tall, 96.4 kg male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of poisoning/overdose. The patient has a history of altered mental status, renal failure, and acidosis. The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 101.1°F (38.4°C)
* Heart rate: 88 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 156/81 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 25 inspirations per minute (ipm)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient has been receiving various medications, including propofol, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. The patient has also been receiving fluid support and has a central venous catheter, arterial line, and PICC line.

The patient's laboratory results show the following:

* White blood cell count: 11.7-13.9 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 29.6-30.5%
* Platelet count: 185-222 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.3-4.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 26-30 mg/dL
* Glucose: 94-110 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: normal
* Coagulation studies: normal
* Liver function tests: normal
* Renal function tests: abnormal

The patient's chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's head CT scan shows no significant abnormalities.

The patient's clinical course has been complicated by the development of sepsis, acute kidney injury, and acidosis. The patient's mental status has been altered, and they have been experiencing tachypnea and tachycardia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Acute kidney injury progression to chronic kidney disease
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiovascular instability
* Neurological sequelae from altered mental status
* Electrolyte imbalances
* Infection-related complications, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection

The patient requires close monitoring and management of their respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal status. The patient's medication regimen should be optimized to minimize the risk of adverse drug events. The patient's nutritional needs should be assessed and met to prevent malnutrition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   37 yo male admitted with Ethylene Glycol ingestion and now with course
   complicated by persistent respiratory failure and renal failure with
   mental status as primary limiting factor contributing to persistent
   respiratory failure.  He has had continued issues of fever through to
   this morning and slow return to organized mental status.  He does,
   however, have good tolerance of ventilatory wean with favorable
   pulmonary mechanics and reassuring blood gases.
   1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])-
   -Levoflox/Flagyl continuting
   -Patient continues to be able to follow simple commands but with slow
   response time
   -Secretions moderate and thin
   -Patient with favorable RSBI on [**4-30**] which is not specific for success
   with extubation
   -Extubation today
   -Tachypnea will be evaluated with ABG
   2) .H/O POISONING / OVERDOSE, OTHER-
   -Dialysis per Renal schedule with plan for dialysis tomorrow
   3)  RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   -Will pursue cultures from catheter
   -Dialysis tomorrow
   4)  ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   -Folate/Thiamine
   -Propofol to wean to off today
   -Move to extubation today
   -Would not expect altered mental status from initial ingestion
   -Seroquel PRN following extubation or if agitated peri-extubation

Summary:

The patient, a 37-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and renal failure secondary to ethylene glycol ingestion. He has a history of fever, and his mental status is the primary limiting factor contributing to persistent respiratory failure. He has been receiving dialysis and antibiotics, and his respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV with a FiO2 of 50%. His physical examination shows tachypnea, diminished breath sounds, and a normal sinus rhythm. His laboratory results show elevated WBC and CRP levels, and his blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and the potential complications include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), respiratory acidosis, and hypoxemia.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is also a concern, and the potential complications include acute kidney injury (AKI), electrolyte imbalance, and fluid overload.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated WBC and CRP levels suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be a sign of delirium, which can be a complication of critical illness and may require treatment with antipsychotics and other medications.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of ethylene glycol ingestion may increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be a life-threatening complication.
6. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may increase his risk of cardiac arrest, which can be a life-threatening complication.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and potential for sepsis may increase his risk of neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, and encephalopathy.
8. Infection: The patient's history of respiratory failure and renal failure increases his risk of infection, which can be a life-threatening complication.

Recommendations:

1. Continue respiratory support with CPAP/PSV and monitor for signs of respiratory failure.
2. Continue dialysis and monitor for signs of renal failure.
3. Monitor for signs of sepsis and treat promptly if symptoms develop.
4. Consider treating delirium with antipsychotics and other medications.
5. Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and treat promptly if symptoms develop.
6. Monitor for signs of cardiac arrest and treat promptly if symptoms develop.
7. Monitor for signs of neurological complications and treat promptly if symptoms develop.
8. Monitor for signs of infection and treat promptly if symptoms develop."
