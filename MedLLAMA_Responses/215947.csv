   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 68 year-old male with HTN and hyperlipidemia with recent
   diagnosis of signet-ring cell gastric cancer invading transverse colon
   s/p subtotal gastrectomy, transverse colectomy, feeding J on [**10-12**] who
   presents with increasing oxygen requirement, persistent tachycardia,
   and EKG changes concerning for ischemia.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypoxia: Patient with post-op hypoxia which may be consistant with
   atelectasis vs. pleural effusions as seen on CXR, as well as post-op
   pneumoperitoneaum which at this point should have resolved.  Cardiac
   etiology, given tachycardia, also possible but no evidence of CHF, PE
   on imaging studies. Pneumonia possible but unlikely as patient has no
   cough and is afebrile.
   - inspiratory spirometry, encourage sitting up
   - ? need for thoracentesis is no improvement in effusions
   - repeat ABG
   .
   # Tachycardia: Improved with IV metoprolol. Hypovolemia still may be
   exacerbating his tachycardia given low UOP, low CVP. Echo consistant
   with LVH, possibly HOCM? Given thickened septum. CTA negative. Cardiac
   enzymes negative -3. Afebrile.
   - continue IV metoprolol to ensure absorption
   - f/u cards recommendations
   - monitor  CVP, IVF bolus to goal of 12
   Echo results: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
   unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
   a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with global
   normal systolic function (cannot exclude regional dysfunction). Mildly
   dilated right ventricle with mild hypokinesis.
   # ST elevations transiently on EKG: CE neg x3, echo suggestive of LVH
   and hypertrophic septum, and mild free wall hypokinesis but nothing
   concerning for large MI. Per cardiology could also consider vasospasm
   as cause of intermittent chest pains and EKG changes.
   - statin, ASA, metoprolol
   - f/u cards recs
   -telemetry
   .
   # Low Urine Output: per surgery goal is 30cc/hr, currently on LR at
   80cc/hr; CVP is also low c/w IV hypovolemia. Also FeNa<1, urine w/
   hyaline casts, granular casts c/w pre-renal etiology. Urine ctx
   negative.
   - continue maintenance fluids as recommended by surgery
   - monitor UOP closely, bolus for CVP<12, UOP <30cc/hr
   .
   # Gastric CA s/p partial gastrectomy/transverse colectomy w/ end-end
   anastamosis: Incision healing nicely, J-tube in place.
   - TF
   - pain control w/ IV dilaudid
   - f/u surgery recs, clarify use of J-tube

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of signet-ring cell gastric cancer invading the transverse colon, who underwent subtotal gastrectomy and transverse colectomy. He is currently in the ICU due to increasing oxygen requirement, persistent tachycardia, and EKG changes concerning for ischemia.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 84 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 108/63 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 87% on 6L O2

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 14.9 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 394 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 151 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Tachycardia
* Mild epigastric discomfort
* Chest discomfort (same as before)

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray (CXR) reveals possible atelectasis or pleural effusions
* Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) shows moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with global normal systolic function, mildly dilated right ventricle with mild hypokinesis

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypoxia: The patient is on oxygen therapy, and the plan is to continue this and encourage sitting up and inspiratory spirometry.
* Tachycardia: The patient is receiving IV metoprolol, and the plan is to continue this and monitor CVP and IVF bolus to goal of 12.
* ST elevations transiently on EKG: The plan is to start statin, ASA, and metoprolol and follow up with cardiology recommendations.
* Low urine output: The patient is receiving maintenance fluids as recommended by surgery, and the plan is to monitor UOP closely and bolus for CVP <12 and UOP <30cc/hr.
* Gastric CA s/p partial gastrectomy/transverse colectomy: The plan is to continue TF, pain control with IV dilaudid, and follow up with surgery recommendations.
* FEN: The patient's TF is at goal.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's EKG changes and tachycardia may be indicative of cardiac ischemia or infarction, and the patient's cardiac enzymes are negative. However, the patient's TEE shows moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, which may increase the risk of cardiac complications.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's hypoxia and possible atelectasis or pleural effusions may increase the risk of respiratory complications.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent gastric surgery and J-tube placement may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or obstruction.
* Renal complications: The patient's low urine output and possible pre-renal etiology may increase the risk of renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
* Infection: The patient's recent surgery and presence of J-tube may increase the risk of infection, particularly in the abdominal cavity or respiratory tract."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 68 year-old male with HTN and hyperlipidemia with recent
   diagnosis of signet-ring cell gastric cancer invading transverse colon
   s/p subtotal gastrectomy, transverse colectomy, feeding J on [**10-12**] who
   presents with increasing oxygen requirement, persistent tachycardia,
   and EKG changes concerning for ischemia.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypoxia: Patient with post-op hypoxia which may be consistant with
   atelectasis vs. pleural effusions as seen on CXR, as well as post-op
   pneumoperitoneaum which at this point should have resolved.  Cardiac
   etiology, given tachycardia, also possible but no evidence of CHF, PE
   on imaging studies. Pneumonia possible but unlikely as patient has no
   cough and is afebrile.
   - inspiratory spirometry, chest PT
   -OOB to chair
   - ? need for thoracentesis is no improvement in effusions
   - repeat ABG if patient becomes increasingly hypoxic
   .
   # Tachycardia: Improved with IV metoprolol. Hypovolemia still may be
   exacerbating his tachycardia given low UOP, low CVP. Echo consistant
   with LVH, possibly HOCM? Given thickened septum. CTA negative. Cardiac
   enzymes negative -3. Afebrile.
   - continue IV metoprolol to ensure absorption
   - f/u cards recommendations
   - monitor  CVP, IVF bolus to goal of 12
   Echo results: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
   unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
   a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with global
   normal systolic function (cannot exclude regional dysfunction). Mildly
   dilated right ventricle with mild hypokinesis.
   # ST elevations transiently on EKG: CE neg x3, echo suggestive of LVH
   and hypertrophic septum, and mild free wall hypokinesis but nothing
   concerning for large MI. Per cardiology could also consider vasospasm
   as cause of intermittent chest pains and EKG changes.
   - statin, ASA, metoprolol
   - f/u cards recs
   -telemetry
   .
   # Low Urine Output: per surgery goal is 30cc/hr, currently on LR at
   80cc/hr; CVP is also low c/w IV hypovolemia. Also FeNa<1, urine w/
   hyaline casts, granular casts c/w pre-renal etiology. Urine ctx
   negative.
   - continue maintenance fluids as recommended by surgery
   - monitor UOP closely, bolus for CVP<12, UOP <30cc/hr
   .
   # Gastric CA s/p partial gastrectomy/transverse colectomy w/ end-end
   anastamosis: Incision healing nicely, J-tube in place.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of signet-ring cell gastric cancer invading the transverse colon, who has undergone subtotal gastrectomy and transverse colectomy. He is currently in the ICU due to increasing oxygen requirements, persistent tachycardia, and EKG changes concerning for ischemia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 84 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 108/63 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 87% on 6L oxygen

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 14.9 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 394 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 151 mg/dL

The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

The patient's current medications include:

* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis)
* Metoprolol (IV)

The patient's physical examination is significant for chest discomfort and mild epigastric discomfort.

The patient's diagnosis is based on the following:

* Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is 87% on 6L oxygen, which may be consistent with atelectasis or pleural effusions. Cardiac etiology is also possible, but there is no evidence of CHF or PE on imaging studies.
* Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is 84 bpm, which may be due to hypovolemia or cardiac hypertrophy. The patient's EKG shows ST elevations, which may be consistent with LVH or hypertrophic septum.
* Low urine output: The patient's urine output is 80 cc/hr, which is below the surgical goal of 30 cc/hr. The patient's CVP is also low, which may be consistent with IV hypovolemia.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 87% on 6L oxygen, which may indicate respiratory failure.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's EKG shows ST elevations, which may be consistent with LVH or hypertrophic septum. The patient's tachycardia may also be due to cardiac hypertrophy.
* Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is 14.9 K/uL, which may indicate an inflammatory response. The patient's temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), which is slightly elevated.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 0.7 mg/dL, which may indicate renal failure.

The patient's plan includes:

* Hypoxia: The patient will receive inspiratory spirometry and chest PT to evaluate for atelectasis or pleural effusions. The patient will also be monitored for signs of cardiac etiology.
* Tachycardia: The patient will continue to receive IV metoprolol to ensure absorption. The patient's CVP will be monitored, and IV fluids will be given to goal of 12.
* Low urine output: The patient will continue to receive maintenance fluids as recommended by surgery. The patient's urine output will be closely monitored, and IV fluids will be given to goal of 30 cc/hr.

The patient's potential interventions include:

* Respiratory support: The patient may require non-invasive ventilation or intubation to improve oxygenation.
* Cardiac support: The patient may require vasopressors or inotropes to improve cardiac function.
* Renal support: The patient may require dialysis to improve renal function.
* Nutritional support: The patient may require enteral or parenteral nutrition to improve nutritional status."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 68 year-old male with HTN and hyperlipidemia with recent
   diagnosis of signet-ring cell gastric cancer invading transverse colon
   s/p subtotal gastrectomy, transverse colectomy, feeding J on [**10-12**] who
   presents with increasing oxygen requirement, persistent tachycardia,
   and EKG changes concerning for ischemia.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypoxia: Patient with post-op hypoxia which may be consistant with
   atelectasis vs. pleural effusions as seen on CXR, as well as post-op
   pneumoperitoneaum which at this point should have resolved.  Cardiac
   etiology, given tachycardia, also possible but no evidence of CHF, PE
   on imaging studies. Pneumonia possible but unlikely as patient has no
   cough and is afebrile.
   - inspiratory spirometry, chest PT
   -OOB to chair
   - ? need for thoracentesis is no improvement in effusions
   - repeat ABG if patient becomes increasingly hypoxic
   .
   # Tachycardia: Improved with IV metoprolol. Hypovolemia still may be
   exacerbating his tachycardia given low UOP, low CVP. Echo consistant
   with LVH, possibly HOCM? Given thickened septum. CTA negative. Cardiac
   enzymes negative -3. Afebrile.
   - continue IV metoprolol to ensure absorption
   - f/u cards recommendations
   - monitor  CVP, IVF bolus to goal of 12
   -1U PRBC
   -PT to assist with ambulation
   Echo results: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
   unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
   a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with global
   normal systolic function (cannot exclude regional dysfunction). Mildly
   dilated right ventricle with mild hypokinesis.
   # ST elevations transiently on EKG: CE neg x3, echo suggestive of LVH
   and hypertrophic septum, and mild free wall hypokinesis but nothing
   concerning for large MI. Per cardiology could also consider vasospasm
   as cause of intermittent chest pains and EKG changes.
   - statin, ASA, metoprolol
   -increase metoprolol to 10mg
   - f/u cards recs
   - telemetry
   - 1U PRBC to maintain hct >28 in setting of ?CAD
   .
   # Low Urine Output: per surgery goal is 30cc/hr, currently on LR at
   80cc/hr; CVP is also low c/w IV hypovolemia. Also FeNa<1, urine w/
   hyaline casts, granular casts c/w pre-renal etiology. Urine ctx
   negative.
   - continue maintenance fluids as recommended by surgery
   - monitor UOP closely, bolus for CVP<12, UOP <30cc/hr
   .
   # Gastric CA s/p partial gastrectomy/transverse colectomy w/ end-end
   anastamosis: Incision healing nicely, J-tube in place.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of signet-ring cell gastric cancer invading the transverse colon, who underwent subtotal gastrectomy and transverse colectomy. He is currently in the ICU due to increasing oxygen requirement, persistent tachycardia, and EKG changes concerning for ischemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, and blood pressure of 108/63 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 87% on 6L O2. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recent surgery, which may be contributing to his current condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is 87% on 6L O2, which may indicate hypoxia. Atelectasis, pleural effusions, or post-operative pneumoperitoneum could be contributing factors. Cardiac etiology is also possible, but no evidence of CHF or PE is present on imaging studies.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is 84 bpm, which is elevated. Hypovolemia may be exacerbating his tachycardia, given his low urine output and low central venous pressure. Echocardiogram results suggest moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal systolic function, but a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
3. Low Urine Output: The patient's urine output is low, with a goal of 30cc/hr, and is currently at 80cc/hr. This may indicate pre-renal etiology, such as hypovolemia or nephrotoxicity.
4. Gastric Cancer: The patient has a history of gastric cancer, which may be affecting his current condition. His incision healing is reported as nice, but he has a J-tube in place, and pain control is being managed with IV dilaudid PCA.
5. Cardiovascular Disease: The patient's EKG changes and echocardiogram results suggest possible cardiac disease, including left ventricular hypertrophy and hypertrophic septum. Cardiac enzymes are negative, but cardiac etiology cannot be ruled out entirely.

Plan:

1. Continue IV metoprolol to manage tachycardia and hypovolemia.
2. Monitor urine output closely and administer IV fluids as needed to maintain a central venous pressure of 12.
3. Repeat ABG if the patient becomes increasingly hypoxic.
4. Consider thoracentesis if the patient's effusions do not improve.
5. Continue pain control with IV dilaudid PCA and monitor for signs of incision healing.
6. Follow up with the surgical team to clarify the use of the J-tube and to manage the patient's gastric cancer.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and consider further cardiac evaluation if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 68 year-old male with HTN and hyperlipidemia with recent
   diagnosis of signet-ring cell gastric cancer invading transverse colon
   s/p subtotal gastrectomy, transverse colectomy, feeding J on [**10-12**] who
   presents with increasing oxygen requirement, persistent tachycardia,
   and EKG changes concerning for ischemia.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypoxia: Patient with post-op hypoxia which may be consistant with
   atelectasis vs. pleural effusions as seen on CXR, as well as post-op
   pneumoperitoneaum which at this point should have resolved.  Cardiac
   etiology, given tachycardia, also possible but no evidence of CHF, PE
   on imaging studies. Pneumonia possible but unlikely as patient has no
   cough and is afebrile.
   - inspiratory spirometry, chest PT
   -OOB to chair
   - ? need for thoracentesis is no improvement in effusions
   - repeat ABG if patient becomes increasingly hypoxic
   .
   # Tachycardia: Improved with IV metoprolol. Hypovolemia still may be
   exacerbating his tachycardia given low UOP, low CVP. Echo consistant
   with LVH, possibly HOCM? Given thickened septum. CTA negative. Cardiac
   enzymes negative -3. Afebrile.
   - continue IV metoprolol to ensure absorption
   - f/u cards recommendations
   - monitor  CVP, IVF bolus to goal of 12
   -1U PRBC
   -PT to assist with ambulation
   Echo results: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
   unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
   a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with global
   normal systolic function (cannot exclude regional dysfunction). Mildly
   dilated right ventricle with mild hypokinesis.
   # ST elevations transiently on EKG: CE neg x3, echo suggestive of LVH
   and hypertrophic septum, and mild free wall hypokinesis but nothing
   concerning for large MI. Per cardiology could also consider vasospasm
   as cause of intermittent chest pains and EKG changes.
   - statin, ASA, metoprolol
   -increase metoprolol to 10mg
   - f/u cards recs
   - telemetry
   - 1U PRBC to maintain hct >28 in setting of ?CAD
   .
   # Low Urine Output: per surgery goal is 30cc/hr, currently on LR at
   80cc/hr; CVP is also low c/w IV hypovolemia. Also FeNa<1, urine w/
   hyaline casts, granular casts c/w pre-renal etiology. Urine ctx
   negative.
   - continue maintenance fluids as recommended by surgery
   - monitor UOP closely, bolus for CVP<12, UOP <30cc/hr
   .
   # Gastric CA s/p partial gastrectomy/transverse colectomy w/ end-end
   anastamosis: Incision healing nicely, J-tube in place.
   - TF start today
   - pain control w/ IV dilaudid PCA
   - f/u surgery recs, clarify use of J-tube

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of signet-ring cell gastric cancer invading the transverse colon, s/p subtotal gastrectomy and transverse colectomy. He presents with increasing oxygen requirement, persistent tachycardia, and EKG changes concerning for ischemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, and blood pressure of 108/63 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 87% on 6L O2.

The patient's lab results show a drop in hematocrit by 7 points, which was confirmed with a repeat CBC. His white blood cell count is 14.9 K/uL, and his platelet count is 394 K/uL. His troponin-T is <0.01, and his creatinine is 0.7 mg/dL. His liver enzymes are mildly elevated, with an AST of 34 IU/L and an ALT of 76 IU/L.

The patient's EKG shows ST elevations, which are transient and not concerning for a large myocardial infarction. His echocardiogram shows moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with global normal systolic function, and mildly dilated right ventricle with mild hypokinesis.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Hypoxia: Inspiratory spirometry, chest PT, and possible thoracentesis
* Tachycardia: Continue IV metoprolol, monitor CVP, and consider IVF bolus
* ST elevations: Statin, ASA, and metoprolol, and possible vasospasm as a cause of intermittent chest pains and EKG changes
* Low urine output: Continue maintenance fluids, monitor UOP closely, and consider IVF bolus
* Gastric CA: TF start today, pain control with IV dilaudid PCA, and f/u surgery recs

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Cardiac complications: Hypoxia, tachycardia, and ST elevations on EKG may indicate cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, cardiac tamponade, or cardiogenic shock.
* Respiratory complications: Hypoxia and low SpO2 may indicate respiratory complications such as pneumonia, atelectasis, or pleural effusions.
* Renal complications: Low urine output and elevated creatinine may indicate renal complications such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
* Gastrointestinal complications: Gastric CA and low urine output may indicate gastrointestinal complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, obstruction, or perforation.
* Infection: Low white blood cell count and elevated liver enzymes may indicate infection such as sepsis or pneumonia."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of chest discomfort and mild epigastric discomfort. The patient has undergone various diagnostic tests and interventions, including an EKG, multi-lumen catheter insertion, and a trans-thoracic echo.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 84 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 108/63 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy at 6L per minute, with a SpO2 of 87%. The patient's respiratory support is maintained with a medium concentration mask.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (14.9 K/uL), platelet count (394 K/uL), and troponin-T levels (<0.01 ng/mL), suggesting possible cardiac injury. The patient's kidney function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 34.0 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the elevated troponin-T levels and possible cardiac injury, the patient is at risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's oxygen requirement and SpO2 level of 87% suggest possible respiratory compromise. The patient may be at risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, or other respiratory complications.
3. Renal complications: The patient's impaired kidney function may lead to acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), or even end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and possible cardiac injury may increase the risk of developing sepsis, septic shock, or other infections.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's mild epigastric discomfort and possible stress ulcer may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or other complications.
6. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's elevated platelet count and possible cardiac injury may increase the risk of developing bleeding complications, such as hematomas or hemorrhagic stroke.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo male s/p gastrectomy and transverse colectomy now admit to ICU
   with post operative hyoxemia, chest discomfort and decreased urine
   output.  He has findings on CT scan to suggest significant regions of
   atelectasis and likely shunt through those regions contributing to
   hypoxia.  No significant findings of PE are described in review of
   scan.  He has had persistent hypoxemia but no significant worsening.
   Decreased HCT is noted overnight.
   1)Hypoxemia
Patient has bilateral areas of consolidation and consistent
   with significant collapse.  Will need to maintain adquate oxygen
   support to allow ambulation
   -OOB to chair
   -OOB and ambulation
   -Continue with good pain control
   -No evidence of PE on CTA
   -
   2)Anemia
he does have decreased HCT noted and has been discussed with
   surgery team
   -Plan to repeat HCT this pm
   3)Tachycardia and ST segment elevations-Is concern for significant
   myocardial ischemia in the setting of tachycardia and anemia.
   Encouraging that patient does not have significant evidence of
   myocardial injury but will need supportive Rx with ASA., rate control
   and adquate volume for ventricular filling
   -ASA to continue
   -PRBC goal would be reasonable to be 30 in the setting of active
   ischemia as suggested by cardiology evaluation and findings on ECG
   -B-blocker and statin are in place

As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo male s/p gastrectomy and transverse colectomy now admit to ICU
   with post operative hyoxemia, chest discomfort and decreased urine
   output.  He has findings on CT scan to suggest significant regions of
   atelectasis and likely shunt through those regions contributing to
   hypoxia.  No significant findings of PE are described in review of
   scan.  He has had persistent hypoxemia but no significant worsening.
   Decreased HCT is noted overnight.
   1)Hypoxemia
Patient has bilateral areas of consolidation and consistent
   with significant collapse.  Will need to maintain adquate oxygen
   support to allow ambulation
   -OOB to chair
   -OOB and ambulation
   -Continue with good pain control
   -No evidence of PE on CTA
   -
   2)Anemia
he does have decreased HCT noted and has been discussed with
   surgery team
   -Plan to repeat HCT this pm
   3)Tachycardia and ST segment elevations-Is concern for significant
   myocardial ischemia in the setting of tachycardia and anemia.
   Encouraging that patient does not have significant evidence of
   myocardial injury but will need supportive Rx with ASA., rate control
   and adquate volume for ventricular filling
   -ASA to continue
   -PRBC goal would be reasonable to be 30 in the setting of active
   ischemia as suggested by cardiology evaluation and findings on ECG
   -B-blocker and statin are in place

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 96 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 114/59 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 15 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 89%
* Central venous pressure (CVP): 6 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results include:

* Hemoglobin (Hb): 8.7 g/dL
* White blood cell count (WBC): 14.9 K/uL
* Platelet count (Plt): 357 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.0 mg/dL
* TropT: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 151 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies include:

* Chest X-ray (CXR): Persistent areas of infiltrate with suggestion of both effusion and consolidation.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient has bilateral areas of consolidation and significant collapse, requiring adequate oxygen support to allow ambulation.
2. Anemia: The patient has decreased HCT, and the plan is to repeat HCT this afternoon.
3. Tachycardia and ST segment elevations: The patient is at risk for significant myocardial ischemia, and supportive treatment with ASA, rate control, and adequate volume for ventricular filling is recommended.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and bilateral areas of consolidation increase the risk of respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient's decreased HCT and tachycardia may indicate an underlying infection, which can lead to sepsis.
* Myocardial infarction: The patient's tachycardia and ST segment elevations suggest the possibility of significant myocardial ischemia, which can lead to myocardial infarction.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient's tachycardia and decreased HCT may indicate an underlying pulmonary embolism.
* Kidney injury: The patient's decreased urine output and increased creatinine level suggest the possibility of kidney injury.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recently diagnosed signet-ring cell gastric cancer, is being treated in the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements, persistent tachycardia, and EKG changes concerning for ischemia. The patient had a subtotal gastrectomy and transverse colectomy, and was started on tube feeds and sips, but experienced bilious emesis with nausea, dark watery brown stool, and belching overnight. The patient was given a one-time dose of Zofran and tube feeds were held. The patient is also experiencing anxiety and was given a one-time dose of Ativan. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, and blood pressure of 138/71 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's experience of bilious emesis, nausea, and dark watery brown stool suggests possible gastrointestinal complications, such as small bowel obstruction, ileus, or gastrointestinal perforation.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's EKG changes concerning for ischemia and persistent tachycardia suggest possible cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, or cardiac failure.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's increasing oxygen requirements and respiratory support suggest possible respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
4. Infection: The patient's dark watery brown stool and belching suggest possible infection, such as Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) or small bowel bacterial overgrowth.
5. Nutritional complications: The patient's experience of bilious emesis and dark watery brown stool may indicate malnutrition and potential complications, such as protein-calorie malnutrition, electrolyte imbalance, or vitamin deficiencies.
6. Psychiatric complications: The patient's anxiety and request for sleep medication suggest possible psychiatric complications, such as anxiety disorder, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder.

Further evaluation and management are necessary to address these potential complications and ensure the patient's optimal care and recovery."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 68 year-old male with HTN and hyperlipidemia with recent
   diagnosis of signet-ring cell gastric cancer invading transverse colon
   s/p subtotal gastrectomy, transverse colectomy, feeding J on [**10-12**] who
   presents with increasing oxygen requirement, persistent tachycardia,
   and EKG changes concerning for ischemia.
   .
   Plan:
   # Gastric CA s/p partial gastrectomy/transverse colectomy w/ end-end
   anastamosis: Post op day 3. Incision healing nicely, J-tube in place.
   Now with bilious emesis and nausea after starting sips and tube feeds
   yesterday.
   - tube feeds started yesterday, although now on hold again given
   bilious emesis  - suspect that most likely etiology is ileus in the
   setting of being bedridden and post-op and not eating much, additional
   possibility is that patient with SBO
   - return to NPO
   - in for upper GI with small bowel follow-through this morning, will
   follow up with surgery regarding plan after scan
   - as per surgery do NOT place NG tube, do NOT give raglan  for nausea,
   will need to reassess plan for care
   - pain control w/ IV dilaudid PCA
   - f/u surgery recs, clarify use of J-tube
   # Hypoxia: Patient with post-op hypoxia which may be consistant with
   atelectasis and pleural effusions as seen on CXR, as well as post-op
   pneumoperitoneaum which at this point should have resolved.  Cardiac
   etiology, given tachycardia, also possible but no evidence of CHF, PE
   on imaging studies. Pneumonia possible but unlikely as patient has no
   cough and is afebrile.
   - chest x-ray from 9 /23 -
   Since yesterday, left pleural effusion significantly increased, with
   adjacent
   atelectasis. Right pleural effusion with basal atelectasis is
   unchanged.
   There is no significant pulmonary edema, but vascular congestion
   persists.
   Right subclavian catheter was installed, probably ends in right atrium.
   No
   pneumothorax. Heart size is unchanged.
   - CT scan of chest [**10-16**]:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No evidence for pulmonary embolism.
   2. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
   3. Right lower, right middle and left lower lobe atelectasis with
   fluid-
   filled airways possibly from a component of aspiration.
   4. Mild ascites as well as fluid within the pericolic gutters and
   lesser sac.
   Omental edema and small mesenteric fluid collection likely related to
   postoperative changes without evidence for anastomotic leak.
   5. Small intra-abdominal free air, likely related to postoperative
   changes.
   6. Mild small bowel dilatation which is incompletely visualized with no
   focal
   obstruction visualized, likely related to postoperative ileus.
   7. Hyperdense lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney incompletely
   characterized on this study and could represent either a hyperdense
   cyst or a
   mass. Would recommend further evaluation with MRI when patient is
   clinically
   able to tolerate study.
   - inspiratory spirometry, chest PT, out of bed to chair, PT to assist
   with ambulation
   - consider therapeutic as well as diagnostic tap of pleural effusions
   if do not improve
 will get ultrasound today to assess size
   - oxygen requirement has been stable
   #Agitation
   Patient was extremely agitated overnight and did not sleep much.
   Appears extremely anxious and worried. Tried ativan 1 mg IV this
   morning which appears to have led to delirium.
   -          avoid benzos in the patient for agitation
   -          would try haldol PRN for agitation
   # Tachycardia: Improved with IV metoprolol. Also s/p transfusion of
   pRBCs x1. Hypovolemia still may be exacerbating his tachycardia given
   initial low UOP, low CVP. Echo consistant with LVH, possibly HOCM?
   Given thickened septum. CTA negative. Cardiac enzymes negative -3.
   Afebrile.
   - continue IV metoprolol to ensure absorption
   - cardiology reccomendations - no cath for now; consider esmolol if
   hypotensive (increase diastolic filling)
   - monitor  CVP, IVF bolus to goal of 12
   - Echo results: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   global normal systolic function (cannot exclude regional dysfunction).
   Mildly dilated right ventricle with mild hypokinesis.
   - will increase beta blocker dose as HR consistently in the 80s
   - follow-up with new cards recs today
   # ST elevations transiently on EKG: CE neg x3, echo suggestive of LVH
   and hypertrophic septum, and mild free wall hypokinesis but nothing
   concerning for large MI. Per cardiology could also consider vasospasm
   as cause of intermittent chest pains and EKG changes.
   - statin, ASA, metoprolol
   - cards recs as above
   - cont telemetry
   - crit this AM is 30, so no need for additional transfusion at this
   time
   .
   # Low Urine Output: per surgery goal is 30cc/hr, currently on LR at
   80cc/hr; CVP is also low c/w IV hypovolemia. Also FeNa<1, urine w/
   hyaline casts, granular casts c/w pre-renal etiology. Urine ctx
   negative.
   - continue maintenance fluids as recommended by surgery
   - monitor UOP closely, bolus for CVP<12, UOP <30cc/hr
   # Anxiety

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 68 year-old male with HTN and hyperlipidemia with recent
   diagnosis of signet-ring cell gastric cancer invading transverse colon
   s/p subtotal gastrectomy, transverse colectomy, feeding J on [**10-12**] who
   presents with increasing oxygen requirement, persistent tachycardia,
   and EKG changes concerning for ischemia.
   .
   Plan:
   # Gastric CA s/p partial gastrectomy/transverse colectomy w/ end-end
   anastamosis: Post op day 3. Incision healing nicely, J-tube in place.
   Now with bilious emesis and nausea after starting sips and tube feeds
   yesterday.
   - tube feeds started yesterday, although now on hold again given
   bilious emesis  - suspect that most likely etiology is ileus in the
   setting of being bedridden and post-op and not eating much, additional
   possibility is that patient with SBO
   - return to NPO
   - in for upper GI with small bowel follow-through this morning, will
   follow up with surgery regarding plan after scan
   - as per surgery do NOT place NG tube, do NOT give raglan  for nausea,
   will need to reassess plan for care
   - pain control w/ IV dilaudid PCA
   - f/u surgery recs, clarify use of J-tube
   # Hypoxia: Patient with post-op hypoxia which may be consistant with
   atelectasis and pleural effusions as seen on CXR, as well as post-op
   pneumoperitoneaum which at this point should have resolved.  Cardiac
   etiology, given tachycardia, also possible but no evidence of CHF, PE
   on imaging studies. Pneumonia possible but unlikely as patient has no
   cough and is afebrile.
   - chest x-ray from 9 /23 -
   Since yesterday, left pleural effusion significantly increased, with
   adjacent
   atelectasis. Right pleural effusion with basal atelectasis is
   unchanged.
   There is no significant pulmonary edema, but vascular congestion
   persists.
   Right subclavian catheter was installed, probably ends in right atrium.
   No
   pneumothorax. Heart size is unchanged.
   - CT scan of chest [**10-16**]:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No evidence for pulmonary embolism.
   2. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
   3. Right lower, right middle and left lower lobe atelectasis with
   fluid-
   filled airways possibly from a component of aspiration.
   4. Mild ascites as well as fluid within the pericolic gutters and
   lesser sac.
   Omental edema and small mesenteric fluid collection likely related to
   postoperative changes without evidence for anastomotic leak.
   5. Small intra-abdominal free air, likely related to postoperative
   changes.
   6. Mild small bowel dilatation which is incompletely visualized with no
   focal
   obstruction visualized, likely related to postoperative ileus.
   7. Hyperdense lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney incompletely
   characterized on this study and could represent either a hyperdense
   cyst or a
   mass. Would recommend further evaluation with MRI when patient is
   clinically
   able to tolerate study.
   - inspiratory spirometry, chest PT, out of bed to chair, PT to assist
   with ambulation
   - consider therapeutic as well as diagnostic tap of pleural effusions
   if do not improve
 will get ultrasound today to assess size
   - oxygen requirement has been stable
   #Agitation
   Patient was extremely agitated overnight and did not sleep much.
   Appears extremely anxious and worried. Tried ativan 1 mg IV this
   morning which appears to have led to delirium.
   -          avoid benzos in the patient for agitation
   -          would try haldol PRN for agitation
   # Tachycardia: Improved with IV metoprolol. Also s/p transfusion of
   pRBCs x1. Hypovolemia still may be exacerbating his tachycardia given
   initial low UOP, low CVP. Echo consistant with LVH, possibly HOCM?
   Given thickened septum. CTA negative. Cardiac enzymes negative -3.
   Afebrile.
   - continue IV metoprolol to ensure absorption
   - cardiology reccomendations - no cath for now; consider esmolol if
   hypotensive (increase diastolic filling)
   - monitor  CVP, IVF bolus to goal of 12
   - Echo results: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   global normal systolic function (cannot exclude regional dysfunction).
   Mildly dilated right ventricle with mild hypokinesis.
   - will increase beta blocker dose as HR consistently in the 80s
   - follow-up with new cards recs today
   # ST elevations transiently on EKG: CE neg x3, echo suggestive of LVH
   and hypertrophic septum, and mild free wall hypokinesis but nothing
   concerning for large MI. Per cardiology could also consider vasospasm
   as cause of intermittent chest pains and EKG changes.
   - statin, ASA, metoprolol
   - cards recs as above
   - cont telemetry
   - crit this AM is 30, so no need for additional transfusion at this
   time
   .
   # Low Urine Output: per surgery goal is 30cc/hr, currently on LR at
   80cc/hr; CVP is also low c/w IV hypovolemia. Also FeNa<1, urine w/
   hyaline casts, granular casts c/w pre-renal etiology. Urine ctx
   negative.
   - continue maintenance fluids as recommended by surgery
   - monitor UOP closely, bolus for CVP<12, UOP <30cc/hr
   # Anxiety
   - patient is very anxious, will likely require something at night to
   sleep, this morning given ativan 1-2 mg IV x 1once, need to follow-up
   with surgery regarding plan for treatment
   .
   .

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of signet-ring cell gastric cancer invading the transverse colon, s/p subtotal gastrectomy and transverse colectomy. He is currently in the ICU due to increasing oxygen requirement, persistent tachycardia, and EKG changes concerning for ischemia.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing post-operative hypoxia, which may be consistent with atelectasis and pleural effusions as seen on CXR.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia has improved with IV metoprolol, and cardiac enzymes are negative.
3. Bilious emesis and nausea: The patient has experienced bilious emesis and nausea after starting sips and tube feeds, which may be related to ileus or small bowel obstruction.
4. Agitation: The patient is extremely agitated and anxious, and has been prescribed Ativan, which led to delirium.
5. Low urine output: The patient's urine output is low, and his CVP is also low, suggesting IV hypovolemia.
6. Fever: The patient is afebrile.
7. Cardiac hypertrophy: The patient has moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with global normal systolic function.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and pleural effusions may lead to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia and cardiac hypertrophy may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Sepsis: The patient's bilious emesis and nausea may lead to sepsis.
4. Delirium: The patient's agitation and anxiety may lead to delirium.
5. Renal failure: The patient's low urine output and IV hypovolemia may lead to renal failure.
6. Anastomotic leak: The patient's recent surgery and bilious emesis may increase the risk of anastomotic leak.
7. Small bowel obstruction: The patient's bilious emesis and nausea may be related to small bowel obstruction.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. IV metoprolol to control tachycardia
2. Ativan for agitation
3. IV fluids to manage hypovolemia
4. Chest x-ray to monitor pleural effusions
5. Cardiology recommendations to monitor cardiac function
6. Statin, ASA, and metoprolol to manage cardiac risk factors
7. Regular monitoring of urine output and CVP to manage IV hypovolemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 68 year-old male with HTN and hyperlipidemia with recent
   diagnosis of signet-ring cell gastric cancer invading transverse colon
   s/p subtotal gastrectomy, transverse colectomy, feeding J on [**10-12**] who
   presents with increasing oxygen requirement, persistent tachycardia,
   and EKG changes concerning for ischemia.
   .
   Plan:
   # Gastric CA s/p partial gastrectomy/transverse colectomy w/ end-end
   anastamosis: Incision healing nicely, J-tube in place. Now with bilious
   emesis and nausea after starting sips and tube feeds yesterday.
   - tube feeds started yesterday, although now on hold again given
   bilious emesis
   - return to NPO
   - in for upper GI with small bowel follow-through this morning, will
   follow up with surgery regarding plan after scan
   - pain control w/ IV dilaudid PCA
   - f/u surgery recs, clarify use of J-tube
   # Hypoxia: Patient with post-op hypoxia which may be consistant with
   atelectasis and pleural effusions as seen on CXR, as well as post-op
   pneumoperitoneaum which at this point should have resolved.  Cardiac
   etiology, given tachycardia, also possible but no evidence of CHF, PE
   on imaging studies. Pneumonia possible but unlikely as patient has no
   cough and is afebrile.
   - chest x-ray from 9 /23 -
   Since yesterday, left pleural effusion significantly increased, with
   adjacent
   atelectasis. Right pleural effusion with basal atelectasis is
   unchanged.
   There is no significant pulmonary edema, but vascular congestion
   persists.
   Right subclavian catheter was installed, probably ends in right atrium.
   No
   pneumothorax. Heart size is unchanged.
   - CT scan of chest [**10-16**]:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No evidence for pulmonary embolism.
   2. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
   3. Right lower, right middle and left lower lobe atelectasis with
   fluid-
   filled airways possibly from a component of aspiration.
   4. Mild ascites as well as fluid within the pericolic gutters and
   lesser sac.
   Omental edema and small mesenteric fluid collection likely related to
   postoperative changes without evidence for anastomotic leak.
   5. Small intra-abdominal free air, likely related to postoperative
   changes.
   6. Mild small bowel dilatation which is incompletely visualized with no
   focal
   obstruction visualized, likely related to postoperative ileus.
   7. Hyperdense lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney incompletely
   characterized on this study and could represent either a hyperdense
   cyst or a
   mass. Would recommend further evaluation with MRI when patient is
   clinically
   able to tolerate study.
   - inspiratory spirometry, chest PT, out of bed to chair, PT to assist
   with ambulation
   - consider therapeutic as well as diagnostic tap of pleural effusions
   if do not improve
   - oxygen requirement has been stable
   # Tachycardia: Improved with IV metoprolol. Also s/p transfusion of
   pRBCs x1. Hypovolemia still may be exacerbating his tachycardia given
   initial low UOP, low CVP. Echo consistant with LVH, possibly HOCM?
   Given thickened septum. CTA negative. Cardiac enzymes negative -3.
   Afebrile.
   - continue IV metoprolol to ensure absorption
   - cardiology reccomendations - no cath for now; consider esmolol if
   hypotensive (increase diastolic filling)
   - monitor  CVP, IVF bolus to goal of 12
   - Echo results: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   global normal systolic function (cannot exclude regional dysfunction).
   Mildly dilated right ventricle with mild hypokinesis.
   # ST elevations transiently on EKG: CE neg x3, echo suggestive of LVH
   and hypertrophic septum, and mild free wall hypokinesis but nothing
   concerning for large MI. Per cardiology could also consider vasospasm
   as cause of intermittent chest pains and EKG changes.
   - statin, ASA, metoprolol
   - cards recs as above
   - cont telemetry telemetry
   - crit this AM is 30, so no need for additional transfusion at this
   time
   .
   # Low Urine Output: per surgery goal is 30cc/hr, currently on LR at
   80cc/hr; CVP is also low c/w IV hypovolemia. Also FeNa<1, urine w/
   hyaline casts, granular casts c/w pre-renal etiology. Urine ctx
   negative.
   - continue maintenance fluids as recommended by surgery
   - monitor UOP closely, bolus for CVP<12, UOP <30cc/hr
   # Anxiety
   - patient is very anxious, will likely require something at night to
   sleep, this morning given ativan 1-2 mg IV x 1once, need to follow-up
   with surgery regarding plan for treatment
   .
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now, likely need to restart maintence fluids, again
   will defer to surgery
   .
   # Access: right subclavian, PIV x2
   .
   # PPx:  Hep SC, pneuomboots, PPI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of gastric cancer, aspiration, and bilateral pleural effusions, pneumonia is a possible complication.
	* Atelectasis: The patient's chest x-ray shows atelectasis, which can lead to respiratory failure.
	* Pleural effusions: The patient's pleural effusions can cause respiratory distress and compromise lung function.
2. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* Ischemia: The patient's EKG changes and tachycardia suggest possible ischemia, which can lead to cardiac arrest or infarction.
	* Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: The patient's echocardiogram shows moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, which can increase the risk of cardiac complications.
3. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Anastomotic leak: The patient's history of subtotal gastrectomy and transverse colectomy increases the risk of anastomotic leak, which can lead to sepsis and death.
	* Small bowel obstruction: The patient's small bowel dilatation and possible focal obstruction can lead to bowel obstruction and perforation.
4. Infection Complications:
	* Sepsis: The patient's history of gastric cancer, aspiration, and pleural effusions increases the risk of sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure.
	* Wound infection: The patient's surgical wounds are at risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and death.
5. Hemodynamic Complications:
	* Hypovolemia: The patient's low CVP and low urine output suggest hypovolemia, which can lead to cardiovascular instability and organ failure.
	* Shock: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension suggest possible shock, which can lead to cardiovascular collapse and death.

To address these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored and managed with:

1. Respiratory support: Oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and chest physical therapy may be necessary to manage respiratory complications.
2. Cardiovascular support: Cardiac medications, such as metoprolol, and cardiac monitoring may be necessary to manage cardiovascular complications.
3. Gastrointestinal support: Tube feeding, nasogastric suctioning, and surgical intervention may be necessary to manage gastrointestinal complications.
4. Infection control: Antibiotics, wound care, and surgical drainage may be necessary to manage infection complications.
5. Hemodynamic support: Fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, and cardiac medications may be necessary to manage hemodynamic complications.

The patient's treatment plan should be closely coordinated with the surgical team, cardiology team, and other healthcare providers to ensure optimal management of the patient's complex medical condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   68yo man s/p gastrectomy and transverse colectomy with end-to-end
   anastomosis in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with post operative hyoxemia thought to be [**2-25**]
   atelectasis and effusions; no e/o PE or cardiac ischemia.
   1) Hypoxemia: Persists
 he has not been up walking, but was up OOB in
   chair yesterday. Currently he is compromised by his altered mental
   status presumptively [**2-25**] ativan. When sensorium clears, continue IS and
   encourage up OOB as his abdominal symptoms allow. PT to work with
   patient. Continue nebs. Continue pain control in post-op setting.
   Again, his hypoxia does not appear to be [**2-25**] infection (no e/o
   pneumonia, embolism, edema or ischemia.) Will assess effusions with U/S
   today as draining them may assist  with lung expansion.
   -
   2) Nausea / vomiting: Off TFs and d/c
ed sips of clears [**2-25**] nausea and
   vomiting. Plan for UGI with SBFT today to evaluate for any e/o SBO. No
   Reglan or NGT per Surgery service. No e/o a catostrophic abdominal
   process
 his abdomen is not tender and he is not rigid. Most likely
   his symptoms are [**2-25**] a post-op ileus however ruling out a SBO is
   warranted and the UGI with SBFT is pending. Increasing frequency of
   anti-emetics would be helpful as well.
   -in follow up a the time of signing of this note patient has CT scan
   c/w ileus and no obstruction
   3) Delirium: Almost certainly [**2-25**] Ativan
 would avoid this in the
   future. Consider Haldol for anxiety in the future.
   4) Heme: Hct stable without e/o active blood loss. Follow daily,
   transfusion goal ~30% given h/o CAD.
   5) CAD: Concern for sub-critical LAD lesion given prior ST elevations.
   Medical management with statins, aspirin and beta-blockade. Goal HR
   apparently is 60-70, adjust beta-blockade as needed. Appreciate
   Cardiology input; may need cath at some point to assess coronary artery
   vasculature however this is not urgent.
   6) Renal: Following UOP and creatinine. Keeping IVF at 50cc/hr. CVP
   appears adequate.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   68yo man s/p gastrectomy and transverse colectomy with end-to-end
   anastomosis in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with post operative hyoxemia thought to be [**2-25**]
   atelectasis and effusions; no e/o PE or cardiac ischemia.
   1) Hypoxemia: Persists
 he has not been up walking, but was up OOB in
   chair yesterday. Currently he is compromised by his altered mental
   status presumptively [**2-25**] ativan. When sensorium clears, continue IS and
   encourage up OOB as his abdominal symptoms allow. PT to work with
   patient. Continue nebs. Continue pain control in post-op setting.
   Again, his hypoxia does not appear to be [**2-25**] infection (no e/o
   pneumonia, embolism, edema or ischemia.) Will assess effusions with U/S
   today as draining them may assist  with lung expansion.
   -
   2) Nausea / vomiting: Off TFs and d/c
ed sips of clears [**2-25**] nausea and
   vomiting. Plan for UGI with SBFT today to evaluate for any e/o SBO. No
   Reglan or NGT per Surgery service. No e/o a catostrophic abdominal
   process
 his abdomen is not tender and he is not rigid. Most likely
   his symptoms are [**2-25**] a post-op ileus however ruling out a SBO is
   warranted and the UGI with SBFT is pending. Increasing frequency of
   anti-emetics would be helpful as well.
   -in follow up a the time of signing of this note patient has CT scan
   c/w ileus and no obstruction
   3) Delirium: Almost certainly [**2-25**] Ativan
 would avoid this in the
   future. Consider Haldol for anxiety in the future.
   4) Heme: Hct stable without e/o active blood loss. Follow daily,
   transfusion goal ~30% given h/o CAD.
   5) CAD: Concern for sub-critical LAD lesion given prior ST elevations.
   Medical management with statins, aspirin and beta-blockade. Goal HR
   apparently is 60-70, adjust beta-blockade as needed. Appreciate
   Cardiology input; may need cath at some point to assess coronary artery
   vasculature however this is not urgent.
   6) Renal: Following UOP and creatinine. Keeping IVF at 50cc/hr. CVP
   appears adequate.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male who underwent gastrectomy and transverse colectomy with end-to-end anastomosis in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]. He is currently in the ICU due to post-operative hypoxemia, nausea, vomiting, and delirium.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Heart rate: 88 bpm (77-108 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 121/57 mmHg (71-146/77 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 31 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 10 mmHg (5-15 mmHg)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 14.9
* Hct: 34.0
* Plt: 459 K/uL
* Cr: 1.0
* TropT: <0.01
* Glucose: 151 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia persists, and he is compromised by his altered mental status presumptively due to Ativan. When his sensorium clears, he will continue to receive incentive spirometry (IS) and be encouraged to walk out of bed (OOB) as his abdominal symptoms allow.
2. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting have resolved, and he has been off tube feeds (TFs) and discontinued sips of clears. A UGI with SBFT is planned to evaluate for any evidence of small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient's abdomen is not tender, and he is not rigid, suggesting that his symptoms are likely due to a post-operative ileus.
3. Delirium: The patient's delirium is likely due to Ativan, and it is recommended to avoid this medication in the future. Haldol may be considered for anxiety in the future.
4. Heme: The patient's Hct is stable without evidence of active blood loss. Daily transfusion goals are set at 30% given his history of CAD.
5. CAD: The patient has a concern for a sub-critical LAD lesion given prior ST elevations. Medical management with statins, aspirin, and beta-blockade is ongoing, and a goal heart rate of 60-70 bpm is being targeted.
6. Renal: The patient's UOP and creatinine are being closely monitored. IVF is being kept at 50cc/hr, and CVP appears adequate.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to continued hypoxemia
* Sepsis or infection due to ongoing ileus or SBO
* Cardiac complications due to CAD or sub-critical LAD lesion
* Renal failure due to inadequate IVF or ongoing hypovolemia
* Delirium or altered mental status due to continued use of sedatives or other medications
* Gastrointestinal complications due to ongoing ileus or SBO, such as perforation or bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a post-operative individual with low urine output (UOP) and hypoxia. The patient has been experiencing increased epigastric pain, nausea, and belching, which was managed with Zofran IV and holding tube feeds.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 121/57 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via a medium concentration mask, and their SpO2 is 100%. The patient's respiratory support includes an ABG reading of 32 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals a general appearance of being undernourished and thin. The patient's eyes and conjunctiva are normal, and there is no evidence of scleral edema. The patient's cardiovascular examination is normal, with no murmurs or rubs. The patient's peripheral vascular examination is incomplete due to lack of assessment.

The patient's lab results show a hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL, white blood cell count of 14.9 K/uL, and platelet count of 84 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.4 mEq/L. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are mildly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 73 IU/L and an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level of 80 IU/L.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's low UOP and hypoxia may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and mild elevation in LFTs may indicate an underlying infection, which can lead to sepsis.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's increased epigastric pain and nausea may indicate a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is slightly positive, which may increase the risk of fluid overload.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's slightly elevated potassium level may indicate an electrolyte imbalance, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Worsening of malnutrition: The patient's undernourished appearance and mildly elevated LFTs may indicate a risk of worsening malnutrition.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   68yo man s/p gastrectomy and transverse colectomy in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with post
   operative hyoxemia thought to be [**2-25**] atelectasis and effusions without
   e/o PE or cardiac ischemia.
   1)Hypoxemia: Persists
 he has not been up walking, but was up OOB in
   chair yesterday. Currently he is compromised by his altered mental
   status presumptively [**2-25**] ativan.
   -
   2)Anemia
he does have decreased HCT noted and has been discussed with
   surgery team
   -Plan to repeat HCT this pm
   3)Tachycardia and ST segment elevations-Is concern for significant
   myocardial ischemia in the setting of tachycardia and anemia.
   Encouraging that patient does not have significant evidence of
   myocardial injury but will need supportive Rx with ASA., rate control
   and adquate volume for ventricular filling
   -ASA to continue
   -PRBC goal would be reasonable to be 30 in the setting of active
   ischemia as suggested by cardiology evaluation and findings on ECG
   -B-blocker and statin are in place

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male who underwent gastrectomy and transverse colectomy in a hospital and was admitted to the ICU due to postoperative hypoxemia, thought to be caused by atelectasis and effusions without evidence of pulmonary embolism or cardiac ischemia. The patient's condition has persisted, and he is compromised by his altered mental status, presumed to be related to Ativan.

The patient has anemia, with a decreased hemoglobin level, and the surgery team has been notified. The plan is to repeat the hemoglobin test this evening.

The patient has tachycardia and ST segment elevations, which are a concern for significant myocardial ischemia in the setting of tachycardia and anemia. The patient does not have significant evidence of myocardial injury, but will require supportive treatment with aspirin, rate control, and adequate volume for ventricular filling.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia persists, and there is a risk of further respiratory compromise.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further compromise of his cardiovascular system.
3. Myocardial ischemia: The patient's tachycardia and ST segment elevations suggest the possibility of significant myocardial ischemia, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias or infarction.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's altered mental status and nausea may indicate gastrointestinal complications, such as ileus or gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Sepsis: The patient's increased white blood cell count and decreased platelet count suggest the possibility of sepsis, which may lead to organ dysfunction or failure.
6. Cardiac failure: The patient's tachycardia and ST segment elevations may indicate cardiac failure, which may lead to cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest.
7. Renal failure: The patient's decreased urine output and increased creatinine level suggest the possibility of renal failure, which may lead to further compromise of his cardiovascular system."

   Assessment and Plan
   68yo man s/p gastrectomy and transverse colectomy with end-to-end
   anastomosis in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with post operative hyoxemia thought to be [**2-25**]
   atelectasis and effusions; no e/o PE or cardiac ischemia.
   1) Hypoxemia: Persists
 he has not been up walking, but was up OOB in
   chair yesterday. Currently he is compromised by his altered mental
   status presumptively [**2-25**] ativan. When sensorium clears, continue IS and
   encourage up OOB as his abdominal symptoms allow. PT to work with
   patient. Continue nebs. Continue pain control in post-op setting.
   Again, his hypoxia does not appear to be [**2-25**] infection (no e/o
   pneumonia, embolism, edema or ischemia.) Will assess effusions with U/S
   today as draining them may assist  with lung expansion.
   -
   2) Nausea / vomiting: Off TFs and d/c
ed sips of clears [**2-25**] nausea and
   vomiting. Plan for UGI with SBFT today to evaluate for any e/o SBO. No
   Reglan or NGT per Surgery service. No e/o a catostrophic abdominal
   process
 his abdomen is not tender and he is not rigid. Most likely
   his symptoms are [**2-25**] a post-op ileus however ruling out a SBO is
   warranted and the UGI with SBFT is pending. Increasing frequency of
   anti-emetics would be helpful as well.
   3) Delirium: Almost certainly [**2-25**] Ativan
 would avoid this in the
   future. Consider Haldol for anxiety in the future.
   4) Heme: Hct stable without e/o active blood loss. Follow daily,
   transfusion goal ~30% given h/o CAD.
   5) CAD: Concern for sub-critical LAD lesion given prior ST elevations.
   Medical management with statins, aspirin and beta-blockade. Goal HR
   apparently is 60-70, adjust beta-blockade as needed. Appreciate
   Cardiology input; may need cath at some point to assess coronary artery
   vasculature however this is not urgent.
   6) Renal: Following UOP and creatinine. Keeping IVF at 50cc/hr. CVP
   appears adequate.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   68yo man s/p gastrectomy and transverse colectomy with end-to-end
   anastomosis in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with post operative hyoxemia thought to be [**2-25**]
   atelectasis and effusions; no e/o PE or cardiac ischemia.
   1) Hypoxemia: Persists
 he has not been up walking, but was up OOB in
   chair yesterday. Currently he is compromised by his altered mental
   status presumptively [**2-25**] ativan. When sensorium clears, continue IS and
   encourage up OOB as his abdominal symptoms allow. PT to work with
   patient. Continue nebs. Continue pain control in post-op setting.
   Again, his hypoxia does not appear to be [**2-25**] infection (no e/o
   pneumonia, embolism, edema or ischemia.) Will assess effusions with U/S
   today as draining them may assist  with lung expansion.
   -
   2) Nausea / vomiting: Off TFs and d/c
ed sips of clears [**2-25**] nausea and
   vomiting. Plan for UGI with SBFT today to evaluate for any e/o SBO. No
   Reglan or NGT per Surgery service. No e/o a catostrophic abdominal
   process
 his abdomen is not tender and he is not rigid. Most likely
   his symptoms are [**2-25**] a post-op ileus however ruling out a SBO is
   warranted and the UGI with SBFT is pending. Increasing frequency of
   anti-emetics would be helpful as well.
   3) Delirium: Almost certainly [**2-25**] Ativan
 would avoid this in the
   future. Consider Haldol for anxiety in the future.
   4) Heme: Hct stable without e/o active blood loss. Follow daily,
   transfusion goal ~30% given h/o CAD.
   5) CAD: Concern for sub-critical LAD lesion given prior ST elevations.
   Medical management with statins, aspirin and beta-blockade. Goal HR
   apparently is 60-70, adjust beta-blockade as needed. Appreciate
   Cardiology input; may need cath at some point to assess coronary artery
   vasculature however this is not urgent.
   6) Renal: Following UOP and creatinine. Keeping IVF at 50cc/hr. CVP
   appears adequate.

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old man who underwent gastrectomy and transverse colectomy with end-to-end anastomosis. He is currently in the ICU due to post-operative hypoxia, nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 121/57 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He has a history of coronary artery disease and is receiving medical management with statins, aspirin, and beta-blockade.

Assessment:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia persists, and he is compromised by his altered mental status. His hypoxia is thought to be due to atelectasis and effusions, and not infection.
2. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting are likely due to post-operative ileus, and a UGI with SBFT is planned to evaluate for any signs of small bowel obstruction.
3. Delirium: The patient's delirium is likely due to the Ativan he received, and consideration is being given to using Haldol for anxiety in the future.
4. Hematocrit: The patient's hematocrit is stable, and he is not showing any signs of active blood loss.
5. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a concern for sub-critical LAD lesion given his prior ST elevations, and medical management with statins, aspirin, and beta-blockade is ongoing.
6. Renal function: The patient's urine output is being followed, and his creatinine levels are being monitored.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's hypoxia and altered mental status make him at risk for developing pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's nausea and vomiting, as well as his altered mental status, make him at risk for developing sepsis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and altered mental status make him at risk for developing respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and concern for sub-critical LAD lesion make him at risk for developing cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or infarction.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's nausea and vomiting, as well as his altered mental status, make him at risk for developing gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and adjust his oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's nausea and vomiting, and consider increasing the frequency of anti-emetics.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status, and consider using Haldol for anxiety in the future.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's hematocrit, and transfuse as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status, and adjust his beta-blockade as needed.
6. Consider obtaining a UGI with SBFT to evaluate for any signs of small bowel obstruction.
7. Consider obtaining a cardiac catheterization to assess the patient's coronary artery vasculature."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a male with hypoxia and post-op ileus, who was administered Ativan for anxiety, which likely caused confusion. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 81 bpm and blood pressure of 119/76 mmHg. The patient is receiving various medications, including Heparin, Metoprolol, and Morphine.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, indicating potential inflammation and tissue damage. The patient's troponin-T levels are below 0.01 ng/mL, indicating no cardiac damage.

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a medium concentration mask, with an SpO2 level of 94%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.51, pCO2 of 41 mmHg, and pO2 of 70 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, and their cardiovascular examination shows a normal sinus rhythm. The patient's abdominal examination shows distension and tenderness, consistent with post-op ileus.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and post-op ileus increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and platelet count may indicate infection, which could worsen the patient's condition.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and elevated troponin-T levels may indicate cardiac complications, which could worsen the patient's condition.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's post-op ileus and distension may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
5. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's immobility and increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy increase the risk of VTE.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should be closely monitored for signs of respiratory failure, infection, cardiac complications, gastrointestinal complications, and VTE. The patient's medications should be adjusted as necessary to manage their conditions, and the patient should be educated on their medications and treatment plan."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 70-inch tall, overweight/obese individual who is being monitored in the ICU for hypoxia. They have been experiencing tachycardia, which cardiology has recommended increasing their beta blocker to address. The patient has a history of post-op ileus, and an NGT was placed, but they pulled it out. No new NGT will be placed unless they start vomiting. The patient has been experiencing anxiety and was given Ativan, but this will be avoided from now on and Haldol will be used instead.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 119/76 mmHg. Their oxygen saturation is 94% on a medium concentration mask. They have a slight respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute.

The patient's physical examination is notable for being well-nourished, with no acute distress. Their cardiovascular examination is normal, with a normal heart rhythm and no murmurs. Their respiratory examination is also normal, with clear breath sounds. Their abdominal examination is notable for being soft, with bowel sounds present, but distended and tender.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, with a platelet count of 418 K/uL. Their kidney function is normal, with a creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. Their liver function is also normal, with an albumin level of 1.9 g/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 94% on a medium concentration mask, which may indicate a risk of respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an infection.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of post-op ileus and has pulled out an NGT, which may indicate a risk of gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's tachycardia may indicate a risk of cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
5. Nutritional complications: The patient is receiving TPN without lipids, which may indicate a risk of nutritional complications such as malnutrition or refeeding syndrome.

Based on this information, the patient should be closely monitored for any signs of respiratory failure, infection, gastrointestinal complications, cardiovascular complications, or nutritional complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 68 year-old male with HTN and hyperlipidemia with recent
   diagnosis of signet-ring cell gastric cancer invading transverse colon
   s/p subtotal gastrectomy, transverse colectomy, feeding J on [**10-12**] who
   presents with increasing oxygen requirement, persistent tachycardia,
   and EKG changes concerning for ischemia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient with post-op hypoxic respiratory distress since day
   1, which most likely is consistend with atelectasis and pleural
   effusion seen on CXR. Cardiac etiology may be possible, but not likely
   given no evidence of CHF on physical exam or in pre-op echocardiogram.
   However, there may be an inflow obstructive problem. [**Name (NI) **] may be
   pre-load dependent and now has CVP of 14. Patient has been afebrile
   with stable hemodynamics. Patient with stable oxygen requirements on
   15L
   -          Continue chest PT
   -          Continue moving patient out of bed
   -          Pleural effusions too small to require tapping as of
   yesterday; will re-asses today
   -          Keep negative balance; goal -500cc
   # Gastric CA s/p partial gastrectomy/transverse colectomy w/ end-end
   anastamosis. Patient with post-op ileus by SBT yesterday and KUB
   unchanged today. Patient still with significant nausea and bilous
   vomit.
   -          NPO for now
   -          Talk to surgery about placing new NGT
   -          No raglan
   -          Continue IVF
   #Agitation: Patient became agitated and confuses yesterday. He was
   sleep deprived, anxious, stressed and received 1mg of Ativan IV, which
   caused him to be delirious.
   -          Avoid benzodiacepines
   -          Haldol PRN for agitation
   # Tachycardia: Improving with beta-blocker; yesterday only borderline
   up to 107. Beta-blocker were increased yesterday and patient responded
   adequately.
   -          Continue IV metoprolol and swith to PO when ileus is
   resolved. Target HR 60-80.
   -          Increase betablocker or start esmolol to increase diastolic
   filling if hypotensive
   -          Maintain CVP >12
   -          Follow up cardiology recs
   # ST elevations transiently on EKG: CE neg x3, echo suggestive of LVH
   and hypertrophic septum, and mild free wall hypokinesis but nothing
   concerning for large MI. Per cardiology could also consider vasospasm
   as cause of intermittent chest pains and EKG changes.
   - statin, ASA, metoprolol
   - cont telemetry
   .
   # Low Urine Output: per surgery goal is 30cc/hr, currently on LR at
   80cc/hr; CVP is adequate now. Patient has been 40-50cc/hr. Urine
   culture negative.
   - continue maintenance fluids as recommended by surgery
   - monitor UOP closely, bolus for CVP<12, UOP <30cc/hr
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now, Patient with LR @80cc/hr, again will defer to
   surgery

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 68 year-old male with HTN and hyperlipidemia with recent
   diagnosis of signet-ring cell gastric cancer invading transverse colon
   s/p subtotal gastrectomy, transverse colectomy, feeding J on [**10-12**] who
   presents with increasing oxygen requirement, persistent tachycardia,
   and EKG changes concerning for ischemia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient with post-op hypoxic respiratory distress since day
   1, which most likely is consistend with atelectasis and pleural
   effusion seen on CXR. Cardiac etiology may be possible, but not likely
   given no evidence of CHF on physical exam or in pre-op echocardiogram.
   However, there may be an inflow obstructive problem. [**Name (NI) **] may be
   pre-load dependent and now has CVP of 14. Patient has been afebrile
   with stable hemodynamics. Patient with stable oxygen requirements on
   15L
   -          Continue chest PT
   -          Continue moving patient out of bed
   -          Pleural effusions too small to require tapping as of
   yesterday; will re-asses today
   -          Keep negative balance; goal -500cc
   # Gastric CA s/p partial gastrectomy/transverse colectomy w/ end-end
   anastamosis. Patient with post-op ileus by SBT yesterday and KUB
   unchanged today. Patient still with significant nausea and bilous
   vomit.
   -          NPO for now
   -          Talk to surgery about placing new NGT
   -          No raglan
   -          Continue IVF
   #Agitation: Patient became agitated and confuses yesterday. He was
   sleep deprived, anxious, stressed and received 1mg of Ativan IV, which
   caused him to be delirious.
   -          Avoid benzodiacepines
   -          Haldol PRN for agitation
   # Tachycardia: Improving with beta-blocker; yesterday only borderline
   up to 107. Beta-blocker were increased yesterday and patient responded
   adequately.
   -          Continue IV metoprolol and swith to PO when ileus is
   resolved. Target HR 60-80.
   -          Increase betablocker or start esmolol to increase diastolic
   filling if hypotensive
   -          Maintain CVP >12
   -          Follow up cardiology recs
   # ST elevations transiently on EKG: CE neg x3, echo suggestive of LVH
   and hypertrophic septum, and mild free wall hypokinesis but nothing
   concerning for large MI. Per cardiology could also consider vasospasm
   as cause of intermittent chest pains and EKG changes.
   - statin, ASA, metoprolol
   - cont telemetry
   .
   # Low Urine Output: per surgery goal is 30cc/hr, currently on LR at
   80cc/hr; CVP is adequate now. Patient has been 40-50cc/hr. Urine
   culture negative.
   - continue maintenance fluids as recommended by surgery
   - monitor UOP closely, bolus for CVP<12, UOP <30cc/hr
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now, Patient with LR @80cc/hr, again will defer to

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of signet-ring cell gastric cancer invading the transverse colon, who underwent subtotal gastrectomy and transverse colectomy. He is currently in the ICU due to increasing oxygen requirement, persistent tachycardia, and EKG changes concerning for ischemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen requirement is increasing, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory distress, atelectasis, and pleural effusion.
2. Post-op ileus: The patient's post-op ileus is ongoing, which may lead to further complications such as nausea, vomiting, and potential electrolyte imbalances.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may worsen, potentially leading to arrhythmias, cardiac instability, or even cardiac failure.
4. Ischemia: The patient's EKG changes and ST elevations may indicate ischemia, which could lead to myocardial infarction or other cardiac complications.
5. Low urine output: The patient's low urine output may indicate acute kidney injury or dehydration, which could worsen his overall condition.
6. Infection: The patient's risk of infection is increased due to his post-op state, and the presence of central lines, arterial lines, and urinary catheters.
7. Bleeding: The patient's risk of bleeding is increased due to his anticoagulant therapy and the presence of central lines and arterial lines.
8. Sepsis: The patient's risk of sepsis is increased due to his post-op state, and the presence of central lines, arterial lines, and urinary catheters.

The patient's current medications include:

* Heparin 5000 units SC tid
* Pantoprazole 40 mg IV q24h
* Insulin SC (per insulin flowsheet)
* Ipratropium bromide neb 1 neb IH q6h
* Albuterol 0.083% neb soln 1 neb IH q4h:PRN
* Morphine sulfate 1-2 mg IV q2h PRN
* Metoprolol tartrate 20 mg IV q3h

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Heart rate: 81 bpm
* Blood pressure: 119/76 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 33 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Central venous pressure: 14 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results include:

* White blood cell count: 14.9 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 418 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Electrolyte levels: sodium 138 mg/dL, potassium 3.9 mEq/L, calcium 7.6 mg/dL, magnesium 2.8 mg/dL, phosphorus 3.3 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing chest physical therapy
* Moving the patient out of bed
* Monitoring urine output closely
* Bolusing fluids for CVP <12 and urine output <30 cc/hour
* Continuing IV fluids
* Monitoring for signs of infection
* Adjusting medications as necessary

The patient's current status is stable, but he is at risk for various complications. Close monitoring and prompt intervention are necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of gastric cancer who underwent surgery and is currently in the ICU due to hypoxemia. He has a post-operative course complicated by significant hypoxemia, likely related to atelectasis, and post-operative ileus. The patient is at risk for possible aspiration due to his ileus.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, which could require mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's atelectasis and ileus increase the risk of developing pneumonia, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
3. Aspiration: The patient's ileus and hypoxemia put him at high risk for aspiration, which could lead to respiratory failure, pneumonia, and sepsis.
4. Sepsis: The patient's ileus and hypoxemia increase the risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ failure and death.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's ileus may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or bleeding.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypoxemia and ileus may lead to cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or arrhythmias.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's hypoxemia and ileus may lead to neurological complications such as seizures, coma, or stroke.
8. Kidney Injury: The patient's hypoxemia and ileus may lead to kidney injury, which could require dialysis.
9. Wound Complications: The patient's surgery and ileus may lead to wound complications such as infection, dehiscence, or delayed healing.

These potential medical complications highlight the need for close monitoring and aggressive management of the patient's condition to prevent complications and ensure the best possible outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of gastric cancer and is currently in the post-operative course. He is experiencing significant hypoxemia, likely related to atelectasis and post-operative ileus. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, and blood pressure of 108/61 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 23 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 94% on nasal cannula.

The patient has been ambulating with the help of physical therapy and has been able to tolerate incentive spirometry. However, he has also been experiencing ileus, which has led to concerns about possible aspiration risk.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and his renal function is stable. His liver function tests are slightly elevated, but his troponin-T level is less than 0.01.

The patient's imaging studies show increased bowel gas consistent with ileus and persistent bilateral lung opacities consistent with collapse and effusion.

The assessment and plan include:

1. Hypoxemia: Continue to use nasal cannula and maintain incentive spirometry 10 times per hour while awake.
2. Ileus: Maintain J-tube clamped and NGT to suction.
3. ICU care: Continue total parenteral nutrition without lipids, and maintain glycemic control.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and atelectasis increase the risk of respiratory failure.
* Aspiration: The patient's ileus and risk of aspiration can lead to pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
* Sepsis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and white blood cell count may indicate the presence of sepsis.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ileus and risk of aspiration can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's age and medical history increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.

Based on this information, it is essential to continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely, and to adjust his treatment plan as necessary to prevent these potential complications."
