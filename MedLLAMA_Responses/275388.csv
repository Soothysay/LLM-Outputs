   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   1. Respiratory Failure
 patient noted to have worsening hypoxemia
   overnight and necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation.
   - continue AC settings and obtain ABG (likely will benefit from A-line)
   - attempt  PSV when tolerated.
   -
   2. Mental Status Changes: Differential includes hepatic encephalopathy,
   medication effect from ativan or active infection. Fulminant hepatic
   failure is possible given her history of alcoholism, acute liver
   failure and now encephalopathy.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor
   given the trend in her LFTs and coags.
   - monitor in ICU for airway protection and oxygenation
   - continue lactulose, midodrine, octreotide, rifaximin
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx Vanc/Ceftriaxone for possible infectious etiology
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - hold on steriods given possible infection
   - dobhoff in placefor medications given inability to swallow
   .
   3. Liver Failure: INR is 2.9 after 2 units FFP and 10mg PO vitamin K
   yesterday.  Bilirubin continues to rise.
   - f/u hepatitis serologies, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth muscle antibody
   - will hold on further FFP unless she shows evidence of active bleed
   - continue vitamin K
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   4. Acute Renal Failure: Likely hepatorenal syndrome.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time.
   - f/u renal consult recommendations
   - albumin 100mg qday x 3 days (day [**2-15**]) - midodrine 12.5mg PO TID,
   octreotide 200SC q8H
   - per family, would want dialysis if it would give her more time for a
   chance of liver recovery
   .
   5. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating but
   bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - transfuse 1 unit pRBCs this morning, obtain post-transfusion HCT;
   transfusion for HCT < 24
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**2-15**])
   .
   6. HTN: currently normotensive
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to worsening hypoxemia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with worsening hypoxemia
* Mental status: altered, with possible hepatic encephalopathy
* Renal status: anuric, with worsening renal failure and possible hepatorenal syndrome
* Liver function: acute liver failure with rising bilirubin and INR
* Hematology: anemia, with possible esophageal or gastric varices
* Cardiovascular: normotensive, but with possible cardiac complications due to liver failure

The potential medical complications that can arise from this condition are:

1. Respiratory failure: further worsening of hypoxemia, leading to respiratory arrest
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: progression to coma or brain death
3. Renal failure: progression to end-stage renal disease or acute kidney injury
4. Liver failure: progression to fulminant hepatic failure, leading to death
5. Cardiovascular complications: cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, or cardiogenic shock
6. Infection: development of sepsis or septic shock due to underlying liver or kidney failure
7. Bleeding: gastrointestinal bleeding or bleeding due to liver failure
8. Electrolyte imbalance: development of electrolyte imbalances due to liver or kidney failure

The patient is currently receiving treatment for these complications, including mechanical ventilation, lactulose, midodrine, octreotide, and rifaximin. The patient's family has been informed of the poor prognosis and has discussed code status with the medical team.

The patient's care plan includes:

1. Close monitoring of respiratory, mental, and renal status
2. Administration of lactulose, midodrine, octreotide, and rifaximin
3. Serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
4. Broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible infectious etiology
5. Consideration of dialysis if the patient's condition worsens
6. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and transfusion of blood products as needed
7. Vitamin K supplementation
8. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels and repletion as needed

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and aggressive treatment are necessary to manage the potential complications that can arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   1. Respiratory Failure
 patient noted to have worsening hypoxemia
   overnight and necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation.
   Likely component due to volume overload (very little UOP and positive
   fluid balance of 3 L yesterday).
   - continue AC settings and obtain ABG (likely will benefit from A-line)
   - Trend ABG
   - attempt  PSV when tolerated.
   .
   2. Mental Status Changes: Differential includes hepatic encephalopathy,
   medication effect from ativan or active infection. Fulminant hepatic
   failure is possible given her history of alcoholism, acute liver
   failure and now encephalopathy.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor
   given the trend in her LFTs and coags.
   - monitor in ICU for airway protection and oxygenation
   - continue lactulose, midodrine, octreotide, rifaximin
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx Vanc/Ceftriaxone for possible infectious etiology
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - hold on steriods given possible infection
   - dobhoff in place for medications given inability to swallow
   .
   3. Liver Failure: INR is 2.9 after 2 units FFP and 10mg PO vitamin K
   yesterday.  Bilirubin continues to rise.
   - f/u hepatitis serologies, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth muscle antibody. MELD
   score is 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab data.
   - will hold on further FFP unless she shows evidence of active bleed
   - continue vitamin K (PO 10 mg daily x 3 days
 today is day #2)
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   .
   4. Acute Renal Failure: Likely hepatorenal syndrome.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time.
   - f/u renal consult recommendations
   - albumin 100mg qday x 3 days (day [**2-15**]) - midodrine 12.5mg PO TID,
   octreotide 200SC q8H
   - per family, would want dialysis if it would give her more time for a
   chance of liver recovery
   - Check with [**Hospital6 707**] re: any recent dye/contrast
   .
   5. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   today) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - transfuse 1 unit pRBCs this morning, obtain post-transfusion HCT;
   transfusion for HCT < 24
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**2-15**])
   .
   6. HTN: currently normotensive
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes. She was intubated and started on mechanical ventilation due to worsening hypoxemia. The patient has a poor prognosis given the trend in her liver function tests and coagulation studies. She is being treated with lactulose, midodrine, octreotide, rifaximin, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's anemia is being monitored, and she is receiving blood transfusions as needed. She is also being treated for hypertension and has a poor prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening hypoxemia and need for mechanical ventilation put her at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's worsening mental status changes and high bilirubin levels increase her risk for hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal failure and anuria increase her risk for acute renal failure.
4. Infections: The patient's immunosuppressed state and poor prognosis increase her risk for infections, including sepsis.
5. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and coagulopathy increase her risk for bleeding, including gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance increase her risk for electrolyte imbalance, including hyperkalemia and hypokalemia.
7. Liver Failure: The patient's worsening liver function tests and coagulation studies increase her risk for liver failure.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypertension and poor prognosis increase her risk for cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrest.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and monitor the patient's respiratory status closely.
2. Monitor the patient's mental status and liver function tests closely, and adjust treatment as necessary.
3. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitor the patient's response to treatment.
4. Monitor the patient's anemia and bleeding risk closely, and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte balance and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Consider liver transplantation or other liver-directed therapies if the patient's liver function continues to decline.
7. Consider dialysis if the patient's renal function continues to decline.
8. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely and adjust treatment as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   1. Respiratory Failure
 patient noted to have worsening hypoxemia
   overnight and necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation.
   - continue AC settings and obtain ABG (likely will benefit from A-line)
   - attempt  PSV when tolerated.
   -
   2. Mental Status Changes: Differential includes hepatic encephalopathy,
   medication effect from ativan or active infection. Fulminant hepatic
   failure is possible given her history of alcoholism, acute liver
   failure and now encephalopathy.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor
   given the trend in her LFTs and coags.
   - monitor in ICU for airway protection and oxygenation
   - continue lactulose, midodrine, octreotide, rifaximin
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx Vanc/Ceftriaxone for possible infectious etiology
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - hold on steriods given possible infection
   - dobhoff in placefor medications given inability to swallow
   .
   3. Liver Failure: INR is 2.9 after 2 units FFP and 10mg PO vitamin K
   yesterday.  Bilirubin continues to rise.
   - f/u hepatitis serologies, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth muscle antibody. MELD
   score is 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab data.
   - will hold on further FFP unless she shows evidence of active bleed
   - continue vitamin K
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   4. Acute Renal Failure: Likely hepatorenal syndrome.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time.
   - f/u renal consult recommendations
   - albumin 100mg qday x 3 days (day [**2-15**]) - midodrine 12.5mg PO TID,
   octreotide 200SC q8H
   - per family, would want dialysis if it would give her more time for a
   chance of liver recovery
   .
   5. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating but
   bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - transfuse 1 unit pRBCs this morning, obtain post-transfusion HCT;
   transfusion for HCT < 24
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**2-15**])
   .
   6. HTN: currently normotensive
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to worsening hypoxemia. The patient has undergone various interventions, including the placement of a PICC line, invasive ventilation, and administration of lactulose, midodrine, octreotide, and rifaximin.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's worsening hypoxemia and need for intubation and mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation settings is essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. **Mental Status Changes:** The patient's encephalopathy may worsen, leading to increased risk of sepsis, bleeding, and other complications. Monitoring for signs of increased intracranial pressure and seizures is crucial.
3. **Liver Failure:** The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are worsening, indicating a high risk of fulminant hepatic failure. Close monitoring of LFTs and coagulation studies is essential to guide further management.
4. **Acute Renal Failure:** The patient's anuric state and worsening renal function indicate a high risk of acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte levels is essential to guide further management.
5. **Anemia:** The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to increased risk of bleeding and other complications. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and transfusion requirements is essential.
6. **HTN:** The patient's current normotensive state may change, leading to increased risk of hypertension-related complications. Close monitoring of blood pressure is essential.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as necessary.
2. Monitor the patient's mental status and encephalopathy, and consider further interventions to manage increased intracranial pressure and seizures.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and coagulation studies, and consider further interventions to manage liver failure.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and electrolyte levels, and consider further interventions to manage acute renal failure.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and transfusion requirements, and consider further interventions to manage bleeding and other complications.
6. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and consider further interventions to manage hypertension-related complications.
7. Consider further interventions to manage the patient's acute liver failure, including liver transplantation if necessary.
8. Consider further interventions to manage the patient's acute renal failure, including dialysis if necessary."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]):  Likely due to pulmonary

   hepatology, but HD probably does not make sense given overall
   prognosis.   Abdomon is not distended or tense, but could consider
   tapping to
   remove fluid
 HEPATORENAL SYNDROME.  Poor urine output.  Prognosis likely very
   poor.  Urine Na slightly elevated for HRS.  Will check back in her
   records if
   she got a dye load or something else to explain ARF.
 .H/O CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC:  High bili, very poor synthetic
   function.
   Anemia:  Hct stable despite 1U.  Can guaiac stool.
   HTN:  BP stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 44-year-old woman with ETOH cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU with worsening liver failure and renal failure. She was intubated due to worsening oxygenation and is currently receiving invasive ventilation. The patient has a history of encephalopathy with asterixis before intubation, but is now unable to follow commands.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/60 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, and her ABG results show a pH of 7.30, pCO2 of 40 mmHg, and pO2 of 50 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show liver dysfunction, with a bilirubin level of 26 mg/dL and an AST level of 98 IU/L. Her renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 5.2 mg/dL and an urea level of 111 mg/dL. The patient has a history of anemia, hypertension, and cirrhosis of the liver.

The patient is at risk for several medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is currently adequate, but she may require further adjustments to her ventilator settings or consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to improve oxygenation.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's poor urine output and elevated urine sodium level suggest that she may be developing hepatorenal syndrome, which is a life-threatening condition that requires close monitoring and management.
3. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell counts and lactate levels, which may indicate the presence of sepsis.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia may increase her risk of bleeding complications, particularly if she requires invasive procedures or surgery.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's cirrhosis and portal hypertension may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly if she develops varices or portal hypertensive gastropathy.
6. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization may increase her risk of developing infections, particularly pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or central line-associated bloodstream infections.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's cirrhosis and portal hypertension may increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiac failure, or pulmonary edema.

In summary, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to address her respiratory, hepatic, and renal failures. She is at risk for several medical complications, and further evaluation and treatment are necessary to improve her outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   1. Respiratory Failure
 patient noted to have worsening hypoxemia
   overnight and necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation.
   Likely component due to volume overload (very little UOP and positive
   fluid balance of 3 L yesterday).
   - continue AC settings and obtain ABG (likely will benefit from A-line)
   - Trend ABG
   - attempt  PSV when tolerated.
   .
   2. Mental Status Changes: Differential includes hepatic encephalopathy,
   medication effect from ativan or active infection. Fulminant hepatic
   failure is possible given her history of alcoholism, acute liver
   failure and now encephalopathy.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor
   given the trend in her LFTs and coags.
   - monitor in ICU for airway protection and oxygenation
   - continue lactulose, midodrine, octreotide, rifaximin
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx Vanc/Ceftriaxone for possible infectious etiology
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - hold on steriods given possible infection
   - dobhoff in place for medications given inability to swallow
   .
   3. Liver Failure: INR is 2.9 after 2 units FFP and 10mg PO vitamin K
   yesterday.  Bilirubin continues to rise.
   - f/u hepatitis serologies, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth muscle antibody. MELD
   score is 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab data.
   - will hold on further FFP unless she shows evidence of active bleed
   - continue vitamin K (PO 10 mg daily x 3 days
 today is day #2)
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   .
   4. Acute Renal Failure: Likely hepatorenal syndrome.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time.
   - f/u renal consult recommendations
   - albumin 100mg qday x 3 days (day [**2-15**]) - midodrine 12.5mg PO TID,
   octreotide 200SC q8H
   - per family, would want dialysis if it would give her more time for a
   chance of liver recovery
   - Check with [**Hospital6 707**] re: any recent dye/contrast
   .
   5. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   today) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - transfuse 1 unit pRBCs this morning, obtain post-transfusion HCT;
   transfusion for HCT < 24
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**2-15**])
   .
   6. HTN: currently normotensive
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   1. Respiratory Failure
 patient noted to have worsening hypoxemia
   overnight and necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation.
   Likely component due to volume overload (very little UOP and positive
   fluid balance of 3 L yesterday).
   - continue AC settings and obtain ABG (likely will benefit from A-line)
   - Trend ABG
   - attempt  PSV when tolerated.
   .
   2. Mental Status Changes: Differential includes hepatic encephalopathy,
   medication effect from ativan or active infection. Fulminant hepatic
   failure is possible given her history of alcoholism, acute liver
   failure and now encephalopathy.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor
   given the trend in her LFTs and coags.
   - monitor in ICU for airway protection and oxygenation
   - continue lactulose, midodrine, octreotide, rifaximin
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx Vanc/Ceftriaxone for possible infectious etiology
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - hold on steriods given possible infection
   - dobhoff in place for medications given inability to swallow
   .
   3. Liver Failure: INR is 2.9 after 2 units FFP and 10mg PO vitamin K
   yesterday.  Bilirubin continues to rise.
   - f/u hepatitis serologies, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth muscle antibody. MELD
   score is 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab data.
   - will hold on further FFP unless she shows evidence of active bleed
   - continue vitamin K (PO 10 mg daily x 3 days
 today is day #2)
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   .
   4. Acute Renal Failure: Likely hepatorenal syndrome.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time.
   - f/u renal consult recommendations
   - albumin 100mg qday x 3 days (day [**2-15**]) - midodrine 12.5mg PO TID,
   octreotide 200SC q8H
   - per family, would want dialysis if it would give her more time for a
   chance of liver recovery
   - Check with [**Hospital6 707**] re: any recent dye/contrast
   .
   5. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   today) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - transfuse 1 unit pRBCs this morning, obtain post-transfusion HCT;
   transfusion for HCT < 24
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.1°C (98.8°F)
* Heart rate: 72 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 103/50 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute (bpm)
* SpO2: 95%
* Weight: 102.7 kg (admission: 101.5 kg)

The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated due to worsening hypoxemia overnight. The differential diagnosis for mental status changes includes hepatic encephalopathy, medication effect from Ativan or active infection.

The patient has the following laboratory results:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 11.1-13.4 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.0-10.5 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 89-102 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 5.2-6.2 mg/dL
* Total bilirubin (T Bil): 15-26.0 mg/dL
* International normalized ratio (INR): 2.9
* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 23-89 IU/L
* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 23-89 IU/L
* Alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos): 91-120 IU/L
* Total protein (TP): 6.2-8.4 g/dL
* Albumin: 3.6-4.9 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.4-2.9 mmol/L
* Calcium (Ca++): 9.5-11.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 1.8-2.5 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4): 6.7-8.4 mg/dL

   - Renal recs: likely ATN (less likely prerenal/HRS); agree w/albumin;
   no urgent need for RRT but will consider in next 1-2 days (need GOC
   discussion first); give Na bicarb as needed for metabolic acidosis;
   dose vanc by levels.
   - Pt given albumin and bicarb.
   - Received 1 unit pRBC at 10am
   - Plan for dialysis [**4-25**]; temp HD line to be placed by IR [**4-25**] with FFP
   prior (goal INR = 1.5). Call IR at 7:15am for schedule and confirm FFP
   dosing.
   - Liver recs: treat fungal UTI; start prednisone 40 mg (day 1 = [**4-24**]);
   encourage nutrition (low-dose tube feeds); vitamin K X 3 days; albumin
   2X50g/day, octreotide/midodrine NOT necessary.
   - Octreotide/midodrine stopped.
   - Started on prednisone for acute alcoholic hepatitis (discriminant
   function 137!).
   - per ID abx approval fellow, holding off on micafungin/fluconazole for
   now given yeast in urine likely contaminant; will repeat U/A and cx.
   If we do decide to treat her UTI, fluconazole has better GU penetration
   than micafungin and neither has been shown to be less hepatotoxic than
   the other.
   - Poor UOP throughout day

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   1. Respiratory Failure
 patient noted to have worsening hypoxemia
   overnight and necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation.
   Likely component due to volume overload (very little UOP and positive
   fluid balance of 3 L yesterday).
   - continue AC settings and obtain ABG (likely will benefit from A-line)
   - Trend ABG
   - attempt  PSV when tolerated.
   .
   2. Mental Status Changes: Differential includes hepatic encephalopathy,
   medication effect from ativan or active infection. Fulminant hepatic
   failure is possible given her history of alcoholism, acute liver
   failure and now encephalopathy.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor
   given the trend in her LFTs and coags.
   - monitor in ICU for airway protection and oxygenation
   - continue lactulose, midodrine, octreotide, rifaximin
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx Vanc/Ceftriaxone for possible infectious etiology
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - hold on steriods given possible infection
   - dobhoff in place for medications given inability to swallow
   .
   3. Liver Failure: INR is 2.9 after 2 units FFP and 10mg PO vitamin K
   yesterday.  Bilirubin continues to rise.
   - f/u hepatitis serologies, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth muscle antibody. MELD
   score is 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab data.
   - will hold on further FFP unless she shows evidence of active bleed
   - continue vitamin K (PO 10 mg daily x 3 days
 today is day #2)
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   .
   4. Acute Renal Failure: Likely hepatorenal syndrome.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time.
   - f/u renal consult recommendations
   - albumin 100mg qday x 3 days (day [**2-15**]) - midodrine 12.5mg PO TID,
   octreotide 200SC q8H
   - per family, would want dialysis if it would give her more time for a
   chance of liver recovery
   - Check with [**Hospital6 707**] re: any recent dye/contrast
   .
   5. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   today) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - transfuse 1 unit pRBCs this morning, obtain post-transfusion HCT;
   transfusion for HCT < 24
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**2-15**])
   .
   6. HTN: currently normotensive
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure
   .

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who has developed acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for various medical complications.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient has worsening hypoxemia and has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The likely cause is volume overload, and the patient is at risk for further respiratory deterioration.
* Mental status changes: The patient has developed encephalopathy, which may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, medication effects, or an active infection. The patient's prognosis is poor, and the liver team has indicated that fulminant hepatic failure is possible.
* Liver failure: The patient's INR is 2.9, and her bilirubin levels are rising. The patient is at risk for further liver deterioration and may require further treatment, including vitamin K and potentially FFP.
* Acute renal failure: The patient has developed anuric renal failure, which is likely due to hepatorenal syndrome. The patient's urine sodium is 29, and she has received IVF boluses and a unit of pRBCs without improvement. The patient may require dialysis if it would give her more time for a chance of liver recovery.
* Anemia: The patient has a low HCT, and her bleeding is minimal. She has been transfused with 1 unit of pRBCs and will require further transfusions if her HCT remains low.
* HTN: The patient is currently normotensive, but her blood pressure will need to be closely monitored.

The patient's lab results are as follows:

* WBC: 11.1
* Hct: 22.0
* Plt: 89
* Cr: 5.4
* TCO2: 15
* Glucose: 115
* Albumin: 3.6
* LDH: 252 IU/L
* Ca++: 9.5 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL
* PO4: 6.7 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies are as follows:

* CXR: The patient has severe volume overload, and her ETT is 1 cm from the carina. The DHT is at the GEJ.

The patient's treatment plan is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: Continue AC settings and obtain ABG. Trend ABG and attempt PSV when tolerated.
* Mental status changes: Monitor in the ICU for airway protection and oxygenation. Continue lactulose, midodrine, octreotide, and rifaximin. Serial labs will be monitored to monitor coags and LFTs.
* Liver failure: Monitor liver labs and consider US-guided paracentesis.
* Acute renal failure: Monitor renal function and consider dialysis if it would give the patient more time for a chance of liver recovery.
* Anemia: Monitor for signs of bleeding and transfuse pRBCs as necessary.
* HTN: Monitor blood pressure and continue to hold Atenolol.

The patient's prognosis is poor, and the liver team has indicated that fulminant hepatic failure is possible. The patient's family will need to be involved in decision-making regarding further treatment and goals of care."

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   1. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status.
   - A-line attempted to be placed yesterday for ABGs; unsuccessful and
   will ask IR to place line today while getting HD line
   - Trend ABG
   - attempt PSV when tolerated
   - HD likely today to remove volume will likely improve respiratory
   status
   .
   2. Hypotension:
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure and give blood
   products as needed
   - hypotension likely will improve with HD as volume overload is treated
   - consider radial a line today
   - start levophed as necessary for MAP >55
   - 100grams albumin today
   .
   3. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is possible given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy.  Per liver
   team, prognosis is poor given the trend in her LFTs and coags.
   - monitor in ICU for airway protection and oxygenation
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx for possible infectious etiology  (vanco day 1 =
   [**4-23**], dose by levels; ceftriaxone day 1 = [**4-23**])
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures (see below)
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   - Dophoff tube migrated, will need to replace or place OG tube for
   nutrition/meds
   .
   4. Liver Failure: INR is 3.6 after 1 unit FFP and 10mg PO vitamin K
   yesterday.  Bilirubin now trending down.
   - f/u hepatitis serologies, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth muscle antibody. MELD
   score is 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab data.
   - continue vitamin K (PO 10 mg daily x 3 days
 [**4-25**] is day #3)
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   .
   5. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - albumin 100mg qday x 3 days (received alb on [**3-8**] PM, [**4-25**] AM)
   - per family, would want dialysis if it would give her more time for a
   chance of liver recovery. Plan for dialysis today. For access we are
   coordinating with IR and renal, will need FFP to reverse coagulopathy
   prior to placement.
   .
   6. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - transfused 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with appropriate increase in Hct;
   transfuse for HCT < 24
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   .
   7. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Replace foley with treatment.
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 URINE CULTURE - At [**2147-4-24**] 08:42 PM
   - Renal recs [**4-24**]: likely ATN (less likely prerenal/HRS); agree
   w/albumin; give Na bicarb as needed for metabolic acidosis; dose vanc
   by levels.  [**4-25**]: will re-eval later today for likely HD.
   - Temp HD line (and ?A-line) to be placed by IR [**4-25**] with FFP prior
   (goal INR = 1.5). Call IR at 7:15am for schedule and confirm FFP
   dosing.
   - Liver recs: treat fungal UTI; start prednisone 40 mg (day 1 = [**4-24**]);
   encourage nutrition (low-dose tube feeds); vitamin K X 3 days; albumin
   2X50g/day, octreotide/midodrine NOT necessary.
   - Per ID abx approval fellow, holding off on micafungin/fluconazole for
   now given yeast in urine likely contaminant; will repeat U/A and cx.
   If we do decide to treat her UTI, fluconazole has better GU penetration
   than micafungin and neither has been shown to be less hepatotoxic than
   the other.
   - Poor UOP throughout day
   - Unable to place A-line - aborted further attempts given high INR and
   risk of hematoma(patient received only 1 unit FFP prior to procedure).
   - Octreotide/midodrine stopped.
   - Pt given bicarb; got albumin at 8m and [**4-25**] 4am for SBP to 80s.
   - Received 1 unit pRBC at 10am
   - Started on prednisone for acute alcoholic hepatitis (discriminant

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not managed appropriately.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and there is a risk of further hypotension if not managed with fluids and vasopressors.
3. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status is deteriorating, and there is a risk of further decline if not managed with lactulose and rifaximin.
4. Liver failure: The patient's liver function is deteriorating, and there is a risk of further liver damage if not managed with vitamin K and FFP.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and there is a risk of further kidney damage if not managed with albumin and dialysis.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is worsening, and there is a risk of further bleeding if not managed with transfusions and vitamin K.
7. Urinary tract infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection, and there is a risk of further infection if not managed with antibiotics and proper hygiene.

To manage these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU. This includes:

1. Respiratory support: The patient requires mechanical ventilation and close monitoring of her respiratory status.
2. Fluid management: The patient requires careful fluid management to prevent further volume overload and hypotension.
3. Lactulose and rifaximin: The patient requires continued management with lactulose and rifaximin to manage her mental status changes.
4. Vitamin K and FFP: The patient requires continued management with vitamin K and FFP to manage her liver function.
5. Albumin and dialysis: The patient requires continued management with albumin and dialysis to manage her acute renal failure.
6. Transfusions and vitamin K: The patient requires continued management with transfusions and vitamin K to manage her anemia.
7. Antibiotics and hygiene: The patient requires continued management with antibiotics and proper hygiene to manage her urinary tract infection.

The patient requires a multidisciplinary approach to manage these potential complications, including input from the ICU team, nephrologists, hepatologists, and infectious disease specialists."

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   1. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status.
   - A-line attempted to be placed yesterday for ABGs; unsuccessful and
   will ask IR to place line today while getting HD line
   - Trend ABG
   - attempt PSV when tolerated
   - HD likely today to remove volume will likely improve respiratory
   status
   .
   2. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is possible given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy.  Per liver
   team, prognosis is poor given the trend in her LFTs and coags.
   - monitor in ICU for airway protection and oxygenation
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx for possible infectious etiology  (vanco day 1 =
   [**4-23**], dose by levels; ceftriaxone day 1 = [**4-23**])
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures (see below)
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   - dobhoff in place for medications given inability to swallow
   .
   3. Liver Failure: INR is 3.6 after 1 unit FFP and 10mg PO vitamin K
   yesterday.  Bilirubin now trending down.
   - f/u hepatitis serologies, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth muscle antibody. MELD
   score is 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab data.
   - continue vitamin K (PO 10 mg daily x 3 days
 [**4-25**] is day #3)
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   .
   4. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - albumin 100mg qday x 3 days (day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   - per family, would want dialysis if it would give her more time for a
   chance of liver recovery. Plan for dialysis likely today; renal will
   re-eval pt in afternoon after receives temporary HD line by IR. Pt will
   need FFP and ?cryo prior to line placement for INR <1.5.
   .
   5. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - transfused 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with appropriate increase in Hct;
   transfuse for HCT < 24
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   .
   6. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of

   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and

   treatment.
   .
   7. HTN: currently normotensive
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   1. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status.
   - A-line attempted to be placed yesterday for ABGs; unsuccessful and
   will ask IR to place line today while getting HD line
   - Trend ABG
   - attempt PSV when tolerated
   - HD likely today to remove volume will likely improve respiratory
   status
   .
   2. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is possible given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy.  Per liver
   team, prognosis is poor given the trend in her LFTs and coags.
   - monitor in ICU for airway protection and oxygenation
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx for possible infectious etiology  (vanco day 1 =
   [**4-23**], dose by levels; ceftriaxone day 1 = [**4-23**])
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures (see below)
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   - dobhoff in place for medications given inability to swallow
   .
   3. Liver Failure: INR is 3.6 after 1 unit FFP and 10mg PO vitamin K
   yesterday.  Bilirubin now trending down.
   - f/u hepatitis serologies, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth muscle antibody. MELD
   score is 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab data.
   - continue vitamin K (PO 10 mg daily x 3 days
 [**4-25**] is day #3)
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   .
   4. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - albumin 100mg qday x 3 days (day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   - per family, would want dialysis if it would give her more time for a
   chance of liver recovery. Plan for dialysis likely today; renal will
   re-eval pt in afternoon after receives temporary HD line by IR. Pt will
   need FFP and ?cryo prior to line placement for INR <1.5.
   .
   5. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - transfused 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with appropriate increase in Hct;
   transfuse for HCT < 24
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   .
   6. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   .
   7. HTN: currently normotensive
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, NPO pending clinical resolution
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: R arm power PICC
   # Communication: Boyfriend [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11865**]

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and volume overload. The patient has a high risk of bleeding due to her liver failure and has received one unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and 10mg of vitamin K. Her INR is 3.6, and her bilirubin is trending down. She has been treated with lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, and her mental status has not improved. The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis and has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to volume overload and worsening mental status. A-line placement was attempted yesterday but was unsuccessful, and the patient will require a temporary HD line to be placed by the IR team today.
2. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status changes are likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, although the differential diagnosis includes medication effect from ativan or active infection. The patient's prognosis is poor given her history of alcoholism, acute liver failure, and encephalopathy.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's liver failure is severe, with an INR of 3.6 and bilirubin trending down. The patient will require serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs, and the liver team has recommended FFP and DDAVP if actively bleeding.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to ATN, less likely HRS. The patient has received IVF boluses and one unit of pRBCs with no improvement in renal failure. The patient is anuric at this time.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to her liver failure and may require transfusion. The patient's Hct has increased after receiving one unit of pRBCs, and she will require further transfusions if her Hct remains low.
6. UTI: The patient has a UTI, and the initial U/A showed yeast and epi. The patient will require treatment with fluconazole, and the dose will be adjusted based on her creatinine clearance.
7. HTN: The patient's HTN is currently controlled, but the patient will require close monitoring of her blood pressure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider placing a temporary HD line to improve oxygenation.
2. Continue to treat the patient's mental status changes with lactulose and rifaximin, and consider adding midodrine and octreotide if the patient's mental status does not improve.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's liver failure and adjust treatment as necessary. The patient will require serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs, and the liver team has recommended FFP and DDAVP if actively bleeding.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal failure and adjust treatment as necessary. The patient may require dialysis if her renal function does not improve.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and transfuse as necessary to maintain a Hct of 24 or greater.
6. Continue to treat the patient's UTI with fluconazole, and adjust the dose based on her creatinine clearance.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's HTN and adjust treatment as necessary."

   24 Hour Events:
 URINE CULTURE - At [**2147-4-24**] 08:42 PM
   - Renal recs [**4-24**]: likely ATN (less likely prerenal/HRS); agree
   w/albumin; give Na bicarb as needed for metabolic acidosis; dose vanc
   by levels.  [**4-25**]: will re-eval later today for likely HD.
   - Temp HD line (and ?A-line) to be placed by IR [**4-25**] with FFP prior
   (goal INR = 1.5). Call IR at 7:15am for schedule and confirm FFP
   dosing.
   - Liver recs: treat fungal UTI; start prednisone 40 mg (day 1 = [**4-24**]);
   encourage nutrition (low-dose tube feeds); vitamin K X 3 days; albumin
   2X50g/day, octreotide/midodrine NOT necessary.
   - Per ID abx approval fellow, holding off on micafungin/fluconazole for
   now given yeast in urine likely contaminant; will repeat U/A and cx.
   If we do decide to treat her UTI, fluconazole has better GU penetration
   than micafungin and neither has been shown to be less hepatotoxic than
   the other.
   - Poor UOP throughout day
   - Unable to place A-line - aborted further attempts given high INR and
   risk of hematoma(patient received only 1 unit FFP prior to procedure).
   - Octreotide/midodrine stopped.
   - Pt given bicarb; got albumin at 8m and [**4-25**] 4am for SBP to 80s.

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   1. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status.
   - A-line attempted to be placed yesterday for ABGs; unsuccessful and
   will ask IR to place line today while getting HD line
   - Trend ABG
   - attempt PSV when tolerated
   - HD likely today to remove volume will likely improve respiratory
   status
   .
   2. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is possible given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy.  Per liver
   team, prognosis is poor given the trend in her LFTs and coags.
   - monitor in ICU for airway protection and oxygenation
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx for possible infectious etiology  (vanco day 1 =
   [**4-23**], dose by levels; ceftriaxone day 1 = [**4-23**])
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures (see below)
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   - dobhoff in place for medications given inability to swallow
   .
   3. Liver Failure: INR is 3.6 after 1 unit FFP and 10mg PO vitamin K
   yesterday.  Bilirubin now trending down.
   - f/u hepatitis serologies, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth muscle antibody. MELD
   score is 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab data.
   - continue vitamin K (PO 10 mg daily x 3 days
 [**4-25**] is day #3)
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   .
   4. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - albumin 100mg qday x 3 days (received alb on [**3-8**] PM, [**4-25**] AM)
   - per family, would want dialysis if it would give her more time for a
   chance of liver recovery. Plan for dialysis likely today; renal will
   re-eval pt in afternoon after receives temporary HD line (and possibly
   A-line) by IR. Pt will need FFP prior to line placement for INR <1.5.
   .
   5. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - transfused 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with appropriate increase in Hct;
   transfuse for HCT < 24
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   .
   6. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   .
   7. Hypotension. History of hypertension, but currently hypotensive to
   normotensive
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure and give blood
   products as needed
   - hypotension likely will improve with HD as volume overload is treated
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, NPO pending clinical resolution
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: R arm power PICC
   # Communication: Boyfriend [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11865**]

   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
 will likely require
   family meeting to discuss clinical status/goals of care

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 URINE CULTURE - At [**2147-4-24**] 08:42 PM
   - Renal recs [**4-24**]: likely ATN (less likely prerenal/HRS); agree
   w/albumin; give Na bicarb as needed for metabolic acidosis; dose vanc
   by levels.  [**4-25**]: will re-eval later today for likely HD.
   - Temp HD line (and ?A-line) to be placed by IR [**4-25**] with FFP prior
   (goal INR = 1.5). Call IR at 7:15am for schedule and confirm FFP
   dosing.
   - Liver recs: treat fungal UTI; start prednisone 40 mg (day 1 = [**4-24**]);
   encourage nutrition (low-dose tube feeds); vitamin K X 3 days; albumin
   2X50g/day, octreotide/midodrine NOT necessary.
   - Per ID abx approval fellow, holding off on micafungin/fluconazole for
   now given yeast in urine likely contaminant; will repeat U/A and cx.
   If we do decide to treat her UTI, fluconazole has better GU penetration
   than micafungin and neither has been shown to be less hepatotoxic than
   the other.
   - Poor UOP throughout day
   - Unable to place A-line - aborted further attempts given high INR and
   risk of hematoma(patient received only 1 unit FFP prior to procedure).
   - Octreotide/midodrine stopped.
   - Pt given bicarb; got albumin at 8m and [**4-25**] 4am for SBP to 80s.
   - Received 1 unit pRBC at 10am
   - Started on prednisone for acute alcoholic hepatitis (discriminant

   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - albumin 100mg qday x 3 days (received alb on [**3-8**] PM, [**4-25**] AM)
   - per family, would want dialysis if it would give her more time for a
   chance of liver recovery. Plan for dialysis likely today; renal will
   re-eval pt in afternoon after receives temporary HD line (and possibly
   A-line) by IR. Pt will need FFP prior to line placement for INR <1.5.
   .
   5. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - transfused 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with appropriate increase in Hct;
   transfuse for HCT < 24
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   .
   6. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   .
   7. Hypotension. History of hypertension, but currently hypotensive to
   normotensive
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure and give blood
   products as needed
   - hypotension likely will improve with HD as volume overload is treated
   .

   electrolytes, NPO pending clinical resolution

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and further deterioration is possible. The patient may require increased respiratory support or consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) if the patient's condition continues to deteriorate.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes are likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, which can progress to coma and death if not managed promptly. The patient requires close monitoring for signs of worsening encephalopathy, and lactulose and rifaximin should be continued to manage the condition.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and the patient may require dialysis to manage fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Infection: The patient has a UTI, and the culture results are pending. The patient requires empiric treatment with fluconazole, and the dose should be adjusted based on the patient's renal function.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and the patient may require vasopressors to manage hypotension.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, and the patient requires close monitoring for signs of bleeding.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and the patient requires aggressive nutritional support to manage the patient's condition.

To manage these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and aggressive management of the patient's condition. The patient should be closely monitored for signs of worsening respiratory failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and acute kidney injury. The patient's UTI should be empirically treated with fluconazole, and the dose should be adjusted based on the patient's renal function. The patient's blood pressure should be closely monitored, and vasopressors should be used as needed to manage hypotension. The patient's coagulopathy should be closely monitored, and the patient should receive vitamin K and FFP as needed to manage bleeding. The patient's nutritional status should be aggressively managed with aggressive nutritional support to manage the patient's condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   1. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status.
   - A-line placed for ABGs- Trend ABG
   - attempt PSV when tolerated
   - continued CVVH  today to remove volume will likely improve
   respiratory status
   .
   2. Hypotension:
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure and give blood
   products as needed
   - hypotension likely will improve with HD as volume overload is treated
   - continue levophed for MAP >55; wean as tolerated
   .
   3. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is possible given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy.  Per liver
   team, prognosis is poor given the trend in her LFTs and coags.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx for possible infectious etiology  (vanco day 1 =
   [**4-23**], dose by HD protocol; ceftriaxone day 1 = [**4-23**])
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures (see below)
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   - Dophoff tube migrated, will need to replace or place OG tube for
   nutrition/meds
   .
   4. Liver Failure: INR is improved to 2.8 this morning after 3 units of
   FFP yesterday.  Bilirubin now trending down.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score is 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**]
   lab data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   .
   5. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - patient with HD catheter placed by renal service yesterday, now on
   CVVH.
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated.
   .
   6. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs today given hypotension and pressor
   requirement; transfusion goal HCT > 24.
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   .
   7. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   - Replace foley with treatment.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   1. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status.
   - A-line placed for ABGs- Trend ABG
   - attempt PSV when tolerated
   - continued CVVH  today to remove volume will likely improve
   respiratory status
   .
   2. Hypotension:
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure and give blood
   products as needed
   - hypotension likely will improve with HD as volume overload is treated
   - continue levophed for MAP >55; wean as tolerated
   .
   3. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is possible given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy.  Per liver
   team, prognosis is poor given the trend in her LFTs and coags.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx for possible infectious etiology  (vanco day 1 =
   [**4-23**], dose by HD protocol; ceftriaxone day 1 = [**4-23**])
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures (see below)
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   - Dophoff tube migrated, will need to replace or place OG tube for
   nutrition/meds
   .
   4. Liver Failure: INR is improved to 2.8 this morning after 3 units of
   FFP yesterday.  Bilirubin now trending down.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score is 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**]
   lab data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   .
   5. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - patient with HD catheter placed by renal service yesterday, now on
   CVVH.
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated.
   .
   6. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs today given hypotension and pressor
   requirement; transfusion goal HCT > 24.
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   .
   7. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   - Replace foley with treatment.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and worsening renal failure, consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The patient has a positive fluid balance of 4 L for the loss of time, indicating volume overload. She is also experiencing hypotension, likely due to volume overload, and is receiving levophed to maintain a MAP >55.

The patient's laboratory results show a high bilirubin level, elevated liver enzymes, and a low platelet count. Her coagulation profile is also abnormal, with an INR of 2.8. She has a MELD score of 45, indicating a poor prognosis.

The patient's respiratory status is being managed with mechanical ventilation, and her fluid balance is being monitored closely. She is receiving CVVH to remove volume and improve her respiratory status.

The patient's mental status changes are likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, although a differential diagnosis includes medication effect from ativan or active infection. She is receiving lactulose and rifaximin to treat her encephalopathy, and her liver team has started her on prednisone.

The patient's anemia is likely due to her liver disease, and she is receiving transfusions to maintain a hematocrit >24. She has a possible UTI, which is being treated empirically with fluconazole.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is being managed with mechanical ventilation, but she is at risk for further deterioration due to her underlying liver disease and volume overload.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to volume overload, and she is at risk for further hypotension if her fluid balance is not managed properly.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes are likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, and she is at risk for further deterioration if her liver disease is not managed properly.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to her liver disease, and she is at risk for further deterioration if her kidney function does not improve.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to her liver disease, and she is at risk for further anemia if her liver function does not improve.
6. UTI: The patient has a possible UTI, which is being treated empirically with fluconazole. She is at risk for further UTI if her urinary tract is not properly managed.
7. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to her immobility and liver disease.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to her liver disease and mechanical ventilation.
9. VAP: The patient is at risk for VAP due to her mechanical ventilation and immobility.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for further complications due to her underlying liver disease and multiple organ dysfunction. Close monitoring and management of her fluid balance, electrolytes, and other organ systems are necessary to prevent further deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status.
   - A-line placed for ABGs; trend ABGs
   - attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (now at 18;
   will decrease to 15)
   - continued CVVH today to remove volume will likely improve respiratory
   status
   .
   #. Hypotension:
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure and give blood
   products as needed
   - continue levophed for MAP >60; wean as tolerated
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is possible given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy.  Per liver
   team, prognosis is poor given the trend in her LFTs and coags.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx for possible infectious etiology  (vanco day 1 =
   [**4-23**], dose by HD protocol; ceftriaxone day 1 = [**4-23**])
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures (see below)
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   - Dophoff tube migrated, will need to replace or place OG tube for
   nutrition/meds
   .
   #. Liver Failure: INR is improved to 2.8 this morning after 3 units of
   FFP yesterday.  Bilirubin now trending down.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations

   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs today given hypotension and pressor
   requirement; transfusion goal HCT > 24.
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The patient has a positive fluid balance of 4 L for the last day and is anuric. Her INR is improving, and bilirubin is trending down. She has received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no improvement in renal failure. The patient has been started on lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, and broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible infectious etiology.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk of developing respiratory failure due to volume overload and worsening mental status. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and adjusting her mechanical ventilation settings as needed is crucial.
2. Hypotension: The patient is at risk of developing hypotension due to her liver failure, renal failure, and ongoing fluid losses. Close monitoring of her blood pressure and administration of blood products as needed are essential.
3. Mental Status Changes: The patient is at risk of developing further mental status changes due to her hepatic encephalopathy and ongoing liver failure. Close monitoring of her mental status and adjusting her medications as needed are crucial.
4. Liver Failure: The patient is at risk of developing further liver failure due to her ongoing liver disease. Close monitoring of her liver enzymes and adjusting her medications as needed are essential.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is at risk of developing further acute renal failure due to her ongoing liver failure and ongoing fluid losses. Close monitoring of her renal function and adjusting her medications as needed are crucial.
6. Anemia: The patient is at risk of developing anemia due to her ongoing blood loss and ongoing liver failure. Close monitoring of her hemoglobin levels and administering blood products as needed are essential.
7. UTI: The patient is at risk of developing a UTI due to her ongoing catheterization and ongoing antibiotic therapy. Close monitoring of her urine culture results and adjusting her antibiotic therapy as needed are crucial.
8. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to her ongoing liver failure and ongoing antibiotic therapy. Close monitoring of her vital signs and adjusting her antibiotic therapy as needed are essential.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and adjusting her mechanical ventilation settings as needed.
2. Continue close monitoring of the patient's blood pressure and administering blood products as needed.
3. Continue close monitoring of the patient's mental status and adjusting her medications as needed.
4. Continue close monitoring of the patient's liver enzymes and adjusting her medications as needed.
5. Continue close monitoring of the patient's renal function and adjusting her medications as needed.
6. Continue close monitoring of the patient's hemoglobin levels and administering blood products as needed.
7. Continue close monitoring of the patient's urine culture results and adjusting her antibiotic therapy as needed.
8. Continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and adjusting her antibiotic therapy as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status.
   - A-line placed for ABGs; trend ABGs
   - attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (now at 18;
   will decrease to 15)
   - continued CVVH today to remove volume will likely improve respiratory
   status
   .
   #. Hypotension:
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure and give blood
   products as needed
   - continue levophed for MAP >60; wean as tolerated
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is possible given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy.  Per liver
   team, prognosis is poor given the trend in her LFTs and coags.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx for possible infectious etiology  (vanco day 1 =
   [**4-23**], dose by HD protocol; ceftriaxone day 1 = [**4-23**])
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures (see below)
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   - Dophoff tube migrated, will need to replace or place OG tube for
   nutrition/meds
   .
   #. Liver Failure: INR is improved to 2.8 this morning after 3 units of
   FFP yesterday.  Bilirubin now trending down.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
   .
   #. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs today given hypotension and pressor
   requirement; transfusion goal HCT > 24.
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   - Replace foley today
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - A line placed
   - OG placed attempted x3 but unclear that below diaphragm, plan to
   re-attempt in AM, started lactulose PR in the meantime.
   - Temporary HD catheter placed (3 units FFP before), CVVH started
   up-titrated to net negative 200-250cc/hr and initially BP tolerating w/
   MAP in 60s but then decreased to 50s, so backed off fluid to 100cc/hr
   and started levophed to maintain MAP >60.
   - Episode of bradycardia to 30s after started levophed. EKG shows
   change from sinus to ectopic atrial rhythm with rate in 50s. Levophed
   stopped then re-started without incident.
   - Able to wean FiO2 from 80% to 50%, tried to wean PEEP but respiratory
   rate increased so maintained at 18 overnight.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and worsening renal failure. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, mental status changes, liver failure, acute renal failure, anemia, and possible UTI.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration due to volume overload and worsening mental status.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to blood loss, and there is a risk of further hypotension if blood products are not administered promptly.
3. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status changes are likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, but the differential diagnosis also includes medication effect or active infection. There is a risk of further deterioration in her mental status if not treated promptly.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's liver failure is likely to worsen, and there is a risk of fulminant hepatic failure if not treated promptly.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely to worsen, and there is a risk of chronic kidney disease if not treated promptly.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely to worsen if not treated promptly, and there is a risk of further bleeding if not transfused.
7. UTI: The patient's UTI is likely to worsen if not treated promptly, and there is a risk of sepsis if not treated promptly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
2. Administer blood products promptly if hypotension persists or worsens.
3. Continue to treat the patient's mental status changes with lactulose, rifaximin, and midodrine, and monitor for signs of worsening encephalopathy.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function tests and coagulation studies closely, and administer FFP and DDAVP as needed.
5. Continue to treat the patient's acute renal failure with CVVH, and monitor for signs of worsening renal failure.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and administer blood products as needed.
7. Treat the patient's UTI with fluconazole, and monitor for signs of worsening infection.
8. Consider a family meeting to discuss the patient's clinical status and goals of care."

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP (now at 12);
   last ABG within normal limits.
   - A-line placed for ABGs; trend ABGs
   - attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (will attempt
   to get PEEP under 10, check RSBI)
   - continued CVVH today to remove volume will likely improve respiratory
   status
   .
   #. Hypotension:
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure and give blood
   products as needed
   - continue levophed for MAP >60; wean as tolerated
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is possible given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx for possible infectious etiology  (vanco day 1 =
   [**4-23**], dose by HD protocol; ceftriaxone day 1 = [**4-23**])
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures (see below)
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR is
   improved to 2.8 this morning after 3 units of FFP [**4-25**].  Bilirubin now
   trending down.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**5-1**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
   .
   #. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs today given hypotension and pressor
   requirement; transfusion goal HCT > 24.
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Repeat UA and culture today; if yeast persist, continue tx with
   fluconazole
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP (now at 12);
   last ABG within normal limits.
   - A-line placed for ABGs; trend ABGs
   - attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (will attempt
   to get PEEP under 10, check RSBI)
   - continued CVVH today to remove volume will likely improve respiratory
   status
   .
   #. Hypotension:
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure and give blood
   products as needed
   - continue levophed for MAP >60; wean as tolerated
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is possible given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx for possible infectious etiology  (vanco day 1 =
   [**4-23**], dose by HD protocol; ceftriaxone day 1 = [**4-23**])
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures (see below)
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR is
   improved to 2.8 this morning after 3 units of FFP [**4-25**].  Bilirubin now
   trending down.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**5-1**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
   .
   #. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs today given hypotension and pressor
   requirement; transfusion goal HCT > 24.
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Repeat UA and culture today; if yeast persist, continue tx with
   fluconazole

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and mental status changes, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and the respiratory therapist is trying to wean her off the ventilator. The patient's PEEP is currently at 12 cmH2O, and the respiratory therapist is trying to get it under 10 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results are within normal limits.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently 109/53 mmHg, and she is receiving norepinephrine to maintain a MAP of 60 mmHg. The patient's lactate level is 1.9 mmol/L, which is slightly elevated.
3. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status is worsening, and she is likely experiencing hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's INR is 2.8, which is slightly elevated.
4. Liver Failure: The patient has acute liver failure secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. Her bilirubin level is trending down, and her INR is improving.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has anuria, and her urine sodium level is 29. She is receiving CVVH to remove volume and improve her renal function.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 8.7 g/dL, and she is receiving transfusions to maintain a hemoglobin level of 24 g/dL.
7.?UTI: The patient has a yeast infection, and the culture is pending. She is being treated with fluconazole, and the treatment will be continued for 3 days.
8. FEN: The patient is at risk for fluid overload, and her IVF is being held off. She is receiving TF through an OG tube.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP (now at 12);
   last ABG within normal limits.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place)
   - Attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (will attempt
   to get PEEP under 10, check RSBI)
   - Continued CVVH today to remove volume will likely improve respiratory
   status
   .
   #. Hypotension:
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure and give blood
   products as needed
   - continue levophed for MAP >60; wean as tolerated
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is possible given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - discontinue propofol today and monitor mental status (restart if
   patient appears uncomfortable)
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx for possible infectious etiology  (vanco day 1 =
   [**4-23**], dose by HD protocol; ceftriaxone day 1 = [**4-23**]); will discontinue
   today [**4-27**] given no clear infectious source and elevated WBC likely
   secondary to steroids
   - monitor for infection and culture if spikes; add on differential to
   morning labs
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures (see below)
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR is
   improved to 2.8 this morning after 3 units of FFP [**4-25**].  Bilirubin now
   trending down.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**5-1**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
   .
   #. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse for goal HCT > 24.
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Repeat UA and culture; if yeast persist, continue tx with fluconazole
   .

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism, acute liver failure, and worsening renal failure. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 12 cmH2O. The ABG results are within normal limits.
* Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive with a MAP of 109 mmHg. She is being treated with norepinephrine and will continue to receive blood products as needed.
* Mental status changes: The patient is likely experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, although the differential diagnosis includes medication effect from ativan or active infection. The patient's mental status is stable at this time.
* Liver failure: The patient has acute liver failure secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. Her INR is improving, and her bilirubin is trending down.
* Acute renal failure: The patient is anuric and has received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs without improvement in her renal function. She is being treated with CVVH.
* Anemia: The patient is anemic with a Hct of 23.5%. She is being transfused with packed red blood cells to maintain a Hct of 24%.
* UTI: The patient has a UTI with yeast and is being treated with fluconazole.

The patient's lab results are as follows:

* WBC: 17.2
* Hct: 23.5
* Platelets: 67
* Creatinine: 4.8
* Bilirubin: 25.3%
* INR: 2.8
* AST: 98
* ALT: 35
* Alkaline phosphatase: 106
* Lactic acid: 1.9 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.6 g/dL
* LDH: 197 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.2 mg/dL

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.5°C
* Heart rate: 64 bpm
* Blood pressure: 109/53 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%

The patient's physical examination is as follows:

* General: Intubated and sedated; jaundiced, not arousable to voice; withdraws to painful stimuli.
* HEENT: Significant scleral icterus, MM dry, small amount of dry blood on lips.
* Lungs: Inspiratory rhonchi and expiratory wheezes diffusely and bilaterally.
* CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
* Abdomen: Soft, distended, non-tender to palpation, no rebound or guarding.
* GU: Foley catheter with brown sediment.
* Ext: Warm, 3+ edema to abdomen bilaterally, 2+ pulses.

The patient's medical history is significant for acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and anemia. She is being treated with CVVH, lactulose, rifaximin, and propofol. She is also receiving IVF boluses and pRBCs as needed.

Based on the patient's current condition and lab results, potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and her PEEP is being weaned. However, she may continue to experience respiratory failure if her underlying condition does not improve.
* Sepsis: The patient has a UTI with yeast and is being treated with fluconazole. She is also at risk for sepsis due to her liver failure and anemia.
* Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to her anemia and liver failure.
* Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her anemia and liver failure.
* Liver failure: The patient has acute liver failure, and her INR is improving. However, she may continue to experience liver failure if her underlying condition does not improve.
* Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and her creatinine is 4.8. She is being treated with CVVH, and her renal function will need to be closely monitored.

In conclusion, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism, acute liver failure, and worsening renal failure. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and her condition is being closely monitored. Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, sepsis, bleeding, infection, liver failure, and renal failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP (now at 12);
   last ABG within normal limits.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place)
   - Attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (will attempt
   to get PEEP under 10, check RSBI)
   - Continued CVVH today to remove volume will likely improve respiratory
   status
   .
   #. Hypotension:
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure and give blood
   products as needed
   - continue levophed for MAP >60; wean as tolerated
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is possible given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - discontinue propofol today and monitor mental status (restart if
   patient appears uncomfortable)
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - broad spectrum abx for possible infectious etiology  (vanco day 1 =
   [**4-23**], dose by HD protocol; ceftriaxone day 1 = [**4-23**]); will discontinue
   today [**4-27**] given no clear infectious source and elevated WBC likely
   secondary to steroids
   - monitor for infection and culture if spikes; add on differential to
   morning labs
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures (see below)
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR is
   improved to 2.8 this morning after 3 units of FFP [**4-25**].  Bilirubin now
   trending down.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**5-1**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
   .
   #. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse for goal HCT > 24.
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Repeat UA and culture; if yeast persist, continue tx with fluconazole
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, mental status changes, and worsening renal failure. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and volume overload. Her laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and renal impairment. She has a history of acute alcoholic hepatitis and is at risk for fulminant hepatic failure. She is also experiencing anemia, and her urine output is low. She has a yeast infection in her urine and is at risk for further complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is at risk due to her hypoxia, volume overload, and worsening mental status. She may require further weaning of her PEEP and consideration of non-invasive ventilation.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes are likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of acute liver failure. She is at risk for further deterioration and may require additional interventions such as lactulose and rifaximin.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and she is at risk for further deterioration. She may require further hemodialysis and close monitoring of her electrolytes and fluid status.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to her acute liver failure and may require transfusion and close monitoring.
5. Infection: The patient has a yeast infection in her urine and is at risk for further complications. She may require additional antibiotics and close monitoring of her urine output and laboratory results.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is a complication of her acute liver failure and may require additional interventions such as vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma.
7. Volume Overload: The patient's volume overload is a complication of her acute liver failure and may require additional interventions such as diuretics and fluid restriction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her PEEP and ventilation accordingly.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust her lactulose and rifaximin doses accordingly.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her hemodialysis and fluid management accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust her transfusion and medication management accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's infection and adjust her antibiotic and fluid management accordingly.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulopathy and adjust her vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma doses accordingly.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's volume overload and adjust her diuretic and fluid restriction management accordingly.

I will continue to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
* The patient has a junctional rhythm and is receiving infusions of norepinephrine and propofol.
* The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia (hemoglobin 8.7 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count 67 K/uL).
* The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 98 U/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 35 U/L.
* The patient's kidney function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 4.8 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 138 mg/dL.
* The patient is receiving dialysis and has a central venous catheter in place.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and the patient is receiving mechanical ventilation. This may indicate underlying respiratory failure.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a junctional rhythm, which may be a sign of underlying cardiac disease or electrolyte imbalances.
* Bleeding complications: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
* Infection: The patient is receiving antibiotics, which may indicate an underlying infection.
* Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, which may indicate underlying liver disease or injury.
* Kidney dysfunction: The patient's kidney function is impaired, which may increase the risk of electrolyte imbalances and other complications.
* Dialysis-related complications: The patient is receiving dialysis, which may increase the risk of complications such as hypotension, bleeding, and infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old woman with ETOH hepatitis, renal failure, and respiratory failure. She is currently on CVVH and improving oxygenation. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, and blood pressure of 107/53 mmHg. She is on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 12 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. Her laboratory results show liver enzymes are elevated, with an ALT of 35 and AST of 98. Her coagulation profile is abnormal, with a PT of 28.8 and PTT of 55.7.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient has altered mental status, bradycardia, respiratory failure, and hepatorenal syndrome. Her ETOH hepatitis is improving, and she will continue to receive lactulose and prednisone. Her respiratory failure will be continued to wean PEEP. Her hypertension will be managed with a low dose of pressor for CVVH. Her encephalopathy will be managed by stopping propofol and continuing lactulose. Her UTI will be managed by stopping all antibiotics except for fluconazole.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's liver failure can worsen her renal function, leading to further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to further hypoxia and hypercapnia.
3. Sepsis: The patient's UTI can progress to sepsis, leading to multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's abnormal coagulation profile can worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's liver failure can lead to electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.
6. Infections: The patient's immunosuppressed state can increase her risk of infections, particularly pneumonia and sepsis.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and liver failure can increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest."

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure, consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP (now at 10);
   last ABG within normal limits.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (will attempt
   to get PEEP under 10, check RSBI)
   .
   #. Hypotension:
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure and give blood
   products as needed
   - continue levophed for MAP >60; wean as tolerated
   - consider possible infection/sepsis given difficulty weaning off
   levophed on CVVH and leukocytosis (though may be secondary to steroids
   as it is temporally related); will obtain blood cultures
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets decreased this morning and fibrinogen
   less than detectable and markedly elevated fibrin degradation products.
   Likely represents DIC though difficult to differentiate from alcoholic
   hepatitis while on CVVH.
   - Received cryoprecipitate X2 this morning [**4-28**].
   - Monitor DIC labs [**Hospital1 **]; goal fibrinogen > 100
   - Obtain blood smear
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely)
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - All antibiotics discontinued [**4-27**] given no clear infectious source
   (vanco day 1 = [**4-23**], dose by HD protocol; ceftriaxone day 1 = [**4-23**])
   - monitor for infection and culture if spikes
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR is
   worsening to 3.4 this morning. Bilirubin slightly increased.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets downtrending
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**5-1**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated, goal TBB today [**4-28**]
   .
   #. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse for goal HCT > 24; will get one unit pRBCs this morning
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - received vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Repeat UA and culture; if yeast persist, continue tx with fluconazole
   for 5 day course started [**4-25**]
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: R arm power PICC, A-line, HD catheter

   and boyfriend [**Name (NI) **]; will readdress today
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
 will likely require
   family meeting to discuss clinical status/goals of care

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure, consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP (now at 10);
   last ABG within normal limits.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (will attempt
   to get PEEP under 10, check RSBI)
   .
   #. Hypotension:
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure and give blood
   products as needed
   - continue levophed for MAP >60; wean as tolerated
   - consider possible infection/sepsis given difficulty weaning off
   levophed on CVVH and leukocytosis (though may be secondary to steroids
   as it is temporally related); will obtain blood cultures
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets decreased this morning and fibrinogen
   less than detectable and markedly elevated fibrin degradation products.
   Likely represents DIC though difficult to differentiate from alcoholic
   hepatitis while on CVVH.
   - Received cryoprecipitate X2 this morning [**4-28**].
   - Monitor DIC labs [**Hospital1 **]; goal fibrinogen > 100
   - Obtain blood smear
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely)
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - All antibiotics discontinued [**4-27**] given no clear infectious source
   (vanco day 1 = [**4-23**], dose by HD protocol; ceftriaxone day 1 = [**4-23**])
   - monitor for infection and culture if spikes
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR is
   worsening to 3.4 this morning. Bilirubin slightly increased.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets downtrending
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**5-1**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated, goal TBB today [**4-28**]
   .
   #. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse for goal HCT > 24; will get one unit pRBCs this morning
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - received vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Repeat UA and culture; if yeast persist, continue tx with fluconazole
   for 5 day course started [**4-25**]

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are worsening, and she has a high MELD score. She is also experiencing thrombocytopenia, likely due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and has received cryoprecipitate and fibrinogen replacement. Her anemia is likely due to chronic bleeding, and she is menstruating. She has a UTI, which is being treated empirically with fluconazole. She is also receiving treatment for liver failure, including lactulose and rifaximin, and has been started on prednisone.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she is at risk for further deterioration due to her underlying liver and renal failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she is at risk for further hypotension due to her underlying liver and renal failure.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and she is at risk for further bleeding due to her underlying liver and renal failure.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is worsening, and she is at risk for further liver failure and encephalopathy.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, and she is at risk for further renal failure and need for dialysis.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to chronic bleeding, and she is at risk for further anemia and bleeding.
7. UTI: The patient has a UTI, which is being treated empirically with fluconazole, and she is at risk for further UTI and sepsis.
8. DIC: The patient has DIC, which is likely due to her underlying liver and renal failure, and she is at risk for further bleeding and organ dysfunction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust her ventilator settings as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust her vasopressor medications as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust her platelet transfusions as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function tests and adjust her treatment accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her dialysis settings as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust her transfusions as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's UTI and adjust her antibiotic treatment as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's DIC and adjust her treatment accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP (now at 10);
   last ABG within normal limits.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place)
   - Attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (will attempt
   to get PEEP under 10, check RSBI)
   - Continued CVVH today to remove volume will likely improve respiratory
   status
   .
   #. Hypotension:
   - continue to hold Atenolol, monitor blood pressure and give blood
   products as needed
   - continue levophed for MAP >60; wean as tolerated
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets decreased this morning and fibrinogen
   less than detectable and markedly elevated fibrin degradation products.
   Likely represents DIC.
   - Received cryoprecipitate this morning.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - discontinue propofol yesterday and monitor mental status (restart if
   patient appears uncomfortable)
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - All antibiotics discontinued [**4-27**] given no clear infectious source
   (vanco day 1 = [**4-23**], dose by HD protocol; ceftriaxone day 1 = [**4-23**])
   - monitor for infection and culture if spikes
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures (see below)
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR is
   worsening to 3.4 this morning. Bilirubin slightly increased.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets downtrending
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**5-1**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
   .
   #. Anemia: No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient has
   esophageal or gastric varices.  She currently is menstruating (stopped
   yesterday) but bleeding is minimal.
   - monitor for signs of bleeding, including guaiac all stools
   - Transfuse for goal HCT > 24; will get one unit pRBCs this morning
   - FFP/DDAVP if any evidence of active bleeding
   - received vitamin K 10mg PO x 3 days (Day [**3-15**] is [**4-25**])
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Repeat UA and culture; if yeast persist, continue tx with fluconazole
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: R arm power PICC, A-line, HD catheter
   # Communication: Boyfriend [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11865**]

   and boyfriend [**Name (NI) **]; will readdress today
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
 will likely require
   family meeting to discuss clinical status/goals of care

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The goal is to wean PEEP and attempt PSV when tolerated.
2. Hypotension: The patient is being monitored for blood pressure and given blood products as needed. Levophed is being used to maintain a MAP >60.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a platelet count of 50 and fibrinogen levels are less than detectable, indicating disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Cryoprecipitate has been administered.
4. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status changes are likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, although the differential diagnosis also includes medication effect from ativan or active infection. The patient is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin.
5. Liver Failure: The patient has acute liver failure secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. The INR is worsening, and bilirubin levels are slightly increased.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has anuric acute renal failure, likely due to ATN. The patient is receiving CVVH and IVF boluses.
7. Anemia: The patient has anemia, and the cause is unclear. The patient is being transfused with pRBCs and FFP/DDAVP is being used if there is any evidence of active bleeding.
8.?UTI: The patient has a UTI, and fluconazole is being used to treat it. The patient is also being monitored for signs of bleeding.

The patient is being managed with the following therapies:

1. Respiratory support: Mechanical ventilation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old woman with ETOH hepatitis, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 107/58 mmHg. She has a history of cirrhosis of the liver and is on steroids. Her mental status is altered, but not delirious, and she is not following simple commands. She has a tracheostomy and is receiving CRRT.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen if not managed properly. The plan is to switch to PSV and continue to wean PEEP, which may not be sufficient to prevent further deterioration.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's acute renal failure is likely related to her cirrhosis and ETOH hepatitis. This condition can worsen if not managed properly, leading to further organ dysfunction.
3. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and lack of response to commands suggest that she may have a new infection. The plan is to check blood cultures, but this may not be sufficient to identify the underlying cause.
4. Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy is likely related to her cirrhosis and ETOH hepatitis. This condition can worsen if not managed properly, leading to further organ dysfunction.
5. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and liver dysfunction make her at risk for bleeding complications.
6. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and lack of response to commands suggest that she may have sepsis. This condition can worsen if not managed properly, leading to further organ dysfunction.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's bradycardia and hypotension suggest that she may have cardiovascular instability, which can worsen if not managed properly.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's liver dysfunction and cirrhosis make her at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust PEEP and FiO2 as necessary.
2. Manage the patient's acute renal failure with CRRT and monitor her electrolyte levels closely.
3. Check blood cultures to identify the underlying cause of the patient's altered mental status and lack of response to commands.
4. Continue to manage the patient's encephalopathy with lactulose and monitor her mental status closely.
5. Monitor the patient's coagulopathy and liver function closely to prevent bleeding complications.
6. Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's treatment plan if sepsis is suspected.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely and adjust her medication regimen as necessary.
8. Consider adding a proton pump inhibitor to the patient's treatment plan to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding."

   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure, consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #Hypotension:  Patient afebrile but with worsening difficulty weaning
   off levophed, leukocytosis, DIC concerning for sepsis.  Potential
   sources of infection include respiratory although stable on ventilator,
   C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   -blood cultures
   -urine culture
   - trend lactate
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast today
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl day 1
   [**2147-4-29**]
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP if PICC is a power PICC
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP (now at 10);
   last ABG within normal limits.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (will attempt
   to get PEEP under 10, check RSBI)
   - propofol sedation for patient comfort
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
   low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. This morning getting 2
   units FFP, 2 units cryoprecipitate due to concern for active bleed with
   significant Hematocrit drop.
   -[**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   -DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices.  Recently menstruating but bleeding
   minimal.  No obvious source of bleeding clinically.  Currently getting
   6  units for HCT of 14
   -serial HCT Q6hr
   -transfuse for HCT <24
   - guaiac stools
   -blood smear for schistocytes
   - consider NGT lavage
   -Ct abdomen / pelvis if stable
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR is
   worsening to 3.4 this morning. Bilirubin slightly increased.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets downtrending
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis; obtain CT abd/pelvis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**5-1**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be slightly positive today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely)
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - monitor for infection and culture if spikes
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   ..
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Repeat UA and culture; if yeast persist, continue tx with fluconazole
   for 5 day course started [**4-25**]
   - f/u repeat culture from [**4-28**]
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and mental status changes, worsening renal failure, and coagulopathy. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. Her laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia. She has a significant hematocrit drop, and her platelet count is low. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and has a pending urine culture.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, which may indicate sepsis. Her coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia may be related to sepsis.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a common complication of acute liver failure.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and she is anuric. Her urine sodium is 29, which may indicate ATN.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is a common complication of sepsis. Her fibrinogen level is low, and her platelet count is low.
5. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding may be due to her coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. Her hematocrit drop may indicate bleeding, and her platelet count is low.
6. Infection: The patient's pending urine culture may indicate a urinary tract infection (UTI). Her laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, which may indicate a liver infection.
7. Liver Failure: The patient's liver failure is likely due to acute alcoholic hepatitis. Her laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, and her MELD score is 45, which indicates a high risk of mortality.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's mental status and coagulopathy closely.
3. Consider transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) or liver transplantation to treat her liver failure.
4. Continue renal replacement therapy (RRT) to treat her renal failure.
5. Monitor the patient's bleeding and consider transfusing platelets and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) if necessary.
6. Consider adding antifungal therapy if the patient's urine culture grows yeast.
7. Monitor the patient's liver enzymes and consider adding antiviral therapy if the patient's liver function deteriorates."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical condition. The patient has undergone significant changes in the past 24 hours, including:

1. Blood cultures sent from the HD cath and PICC, as well as urine culture sent from the Foley catheter.
2. Development of altered mental status, characterized by increased sedation, but still not following commands.
3. Hemodynamic instability, with a drop in HCT to 14 and increased levophed requirement.
4. Increase in WBC count to 33, with no obvious source of bleeding.
5. Abdominal pain and tenderness, with no ascites to tap.
6. Presence of jaundice, scleral icterus, and increased liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and Alk Phos).
7. Acute respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
8. Presence of edema and ascites, with a positive Foley catheter output.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Sepsis and septic shock, given the presence of positive blood cultures and increased WBC count.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome, given the presence of liver disease and acute kidney injury.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), given the presence of acute respiratory failure and hypoxia.
4. Coagulopathy, given the presence of DIC and decreased fibrinogen levels.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding, given the presence of abdominal pain and tenderness.
6. Infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections, given the presence of positive urine cultures.
7. Cardiac complications, such as bradycardia, given the presence of increased levophed requirement.
8. Neurological complications, such as increased intracranial pressure, given the presence of altered mental status.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of their condition, including:

1. Continued hemodynamic support with levophed and vasopressors.
2. Management of respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation.
3. Control of abdominal pain and tenderness with analgesics and anti-inflammatory medications.
4. Management of liver disease with lactulose and rifampicin.
5. Monitoring of coagulation status with regular blood tests.
6. Treatment of infections with antibiotics.
7. Monitoring of cardiac function with echocardiography and cardiac enzymes.
8. Neurological monitoring with regular neurological exams and imaging studies."

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure, consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #Hypotension:  Patient afebrile but with worsening difficulty weaning
   off levophed, leukocytosis, DIC concerning for sepsis.  Potential
   sources of infection include respiratory although stable on ventilator,
   C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   -blood cultures
   -urine culture
   - trend lactate
   - Abdominal U/S to eval for tappable pocket - consider paracentesis to
   evaluate for SBP
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl day 1
   [**2147-4-29**]
   - hold atenolol
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP (now at 10);
   last ABG within normal limits.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (will attempt
   to get PEEP under 10, check RSBI)
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
   low platelets with increased thrombin generation
   (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated FDP).
   Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. This morning getting 2
   units FFP, 2 units cryoprecipitate due to concern for active bleed with
   significant Hematocrit drop.
   -[**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100K
   -DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices.  Recently menstruating but bleeding
   minimal.  No obvious source of bleeding clinically.  Currently getting
   2  units for HCT of 14
   -serial HCT Q6hr
   -transfuse for HCT <24
   - guaiac stools
   -blood smear for schistocytes
   - consider NGT lavage
   -Ct abdomen / pelvis if stable
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR is
   worsening to 3.4 this morning. Bilirubin slightly increased.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets downtrending
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**5-1**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely)
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - monitor for infection and culture if spikes
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   ..
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Repeat UA and culture; if yeast persist, continue tx with fluconazole
   for 5 day course started [**4-25**]
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure, consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #Hypotension:  Patient afebrile but with worsening difficulty weaning
   off levophed, leukocytosis, DIC concerning for sepsis.  Potential
   sources of infection include respiratory although stable on ventilator,
   C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   -blood cultures
   -urine culture
   - trend lactate
   - Abdominal U/S to eval for tappable pocket - consider paracentesis to
   evaluate for SBP
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl day 1
   [**2147-4-29**]
   - hold atenolol
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP (now at 10);
   last ABG within normal limits.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (will attempt
   to get PEEP under 10, check RSBI)
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
   low platelets with increased thrombin generation
   (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated FDP).
   Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. This morning getting 2
   units FFP, 2 units cryoprecipitate due to concern for active bleed with
   significant Hematocrit drop.
   -[**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100K
   -DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices.  Recently menstruating but bleeding
   minimal.  No obvious source of bleeding clinically.  Currently getting
   2  units for HCT of 14
   -serial HCT Q6hr
   -transfuse for HCT <24
   - guaiac stools
   -blood smear for schistocytes
   - consider NGT lavage
   -Ct abdomen / pelvis if stable
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR is
   worsening to 3.4 this morning. Bilirubin slightly increased.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets downtrending
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**5-1**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely)
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - monitor for infection and culture if spikes
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   ..
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Repeat UA and culture; if yeast persist, continue tx with fluconazole
   for 5 day course started [**4-25**]
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: R arm power PICC, A-line, HD catheter
   # Communication: Boyfriend [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11865**]
   # Code:  Full; no formal HCP - code status discussed with Brother [**Name (NI) **]
   and boyfriend [**Name (NI) **]; will readdress today
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
 will likely require
   family meeting to discuss clinical status/goals of care

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis, DIC, and worsening renal failure, which may indicate sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of further respiratory deterioration.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelets, which may lead to bleeding complications.
4. Anemia: The patient has a significant hematocrit drop, which may indicate active bleeding or hemolysis/DIC.
5. Liver failure: The patient has acute liver failure, which may lead to further liver damage and potentially fatal complications.
6. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may require dialysis and potentially lead to further complications.
7. Infection: The patient has a growing yeast in the urine culture, which may indicate a urinary tract infection.
8. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has worsening mental status, which may indicate further progression of hepatic encephalopathy.
9. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, which may lead to bleeding complications.
10. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a low blood pressure, which may indicate cardiovascular instability.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis.
2. Levophed to goal MAP >65 and wean as tolerated.
3. Hemodialysis as needed.
4. Transfusion of blood products as needed.
5. Lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.
6. Midodrine and octreotide discontinued due to HRS unlikely.
7. Propofol discontinued due to potential for prolonged sedation.
8. Monitoring of liver function tests and coagulation studies.
9. Repeat cultures and urinalysis to guide further treatment.
10. Consideration of paracentesis and US-guided paracentesis.

The patient's current condition is critical, and further monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent complications and improve outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old woman with cirrhosis of the liver, likely due to alcohol consumption, who is critically ill and has developed respiratory failure, liver failure, and hypotension.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has hypotension, with a blood pressure of 115/63 mmHg, and is receiving norepinephrine to support her blood pressure.
* Hematological status: The patient has a low hemoglobin level of 4.7 g/dL, a white blood cell count of 32.2 K/uL, and a platelet count of 63 K/uL.
* Renal status: The patient has acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 19 mEq/L.
* Neurological status: The patient is sedated and has altered mental status, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8.
* Liver function: The patient has liver failure, with a bilirubin level of 171 mg/dL and a alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 132 IU/L.

The patient has undergone various interventions, including:

* Mechanical ventilation
* Norepinephrine infusion to support blood pressure
* Transfusion of packed red blood cells, cryoprecipitate, and fresh frozen plasma
* Administration of antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole
* Lactulose to treat encephalopathy
* CVVH to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalance
* Fluconazole to treat suspected urinary tract infection

The patient's condition is critical, and the prognosis appears to be poor. The patient's family has been updated on the clinical situation, and the patient's code status is full code.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock
* Respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Hepatorenal syndrome
* Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
* Liver failure and encephalopathy
* Acute kidney injury and acute tubular necrosis
* Electrolyte imbalance and acid-base disorders
* Infection and sepsis
* Hemorrhage and bleeding disorders

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and to adjust therapy accordingly to manage these potential complications and improve the patient's outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old woman with cirrhosis of the liver due to alcoholism, who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, liver failure, and hypotension. She has a Hct drop to 13.5% and WBC up to 32. She is sedated and has encephalopathy, making it difficult to obtain a reliable medical history. She is receiving mechanical ventilation, norepinephrine, and propofol infusions. Her lab results show evidence of liver and kidney dysfunction, anemia, and DIC. She has a UTI and is receiving treatment for it.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated WBC count suggest sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to her underlying liver disease and potential sepsis.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is compromised, which can lead to further decompensation and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Kidney Failure: The patient's kidney function is impaired, which can worsen her overall condition and increase the risk of acute kidney injury.
5. DIC: The patient's DIC may worsen due to her underlying liver disease and potential sepsis, which can lead to bleeding complications and organ failure.
6. UTI: The patient's UTI may progress and lead to sepsis, which can worsen her overall condition.
7. Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy may worsen due to her underlying liver disease and potential sepsis, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Hemorrhage: The patient's DIC may lead to bleeding complications, including hematemesis, melena, or hematuria.
9. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and potential sepsis make her susceptible to further infections, which can worsen her overall condition.

Given the patient's critical condition, it is essential to monitor her closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly. The patient's family should be informed of her poor prognosis and the potential complications that may arise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple complex medical conditions. The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C-diff) colitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and a rectus sheath hematoma.

The patient has received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells, 2 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate. They are currently receiving propofol infusions at a rate of 30 mcg/kg/min. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure of 134/74 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of DIC, with a platelet count of 27,000/μL, international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.6, and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 36.9 seconds. The patient's kidney function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 17 mg/dL.

The patient's respiratory status is also compromised, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 272 and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 543 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O.

The patient's nutritional status is a concern, with a total parenteral nutrition (TPN) order in place. The patient's glycemic control is also a concern, with a blood glucose level of 188 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history is significant for a recent surgical procedure, and they have a PICC line, dialysis catheter, and arterial line in place. The patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's diagnosis of C-diff colitis and DIC, they are at high risk for developing sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is low, indicating respiratory failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction.
4. Hemorrhage: The patient's platelet count is low, and they have a rectus sheath hematoma, making them at risk for bleeding complications.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, putting them at risk for malnutrition-related complications.

Given the patient's complex medical conditions and potential complications, it is essential to continue monitoring their condition closely and adjusting their treatment plan as necessary to ensure the best possible outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 101.5 kg individual with a chief complaint of altered mental status, bradycardia, respiratory failure, and hepatorenal syndrome. The patient has a history of cirrhosis of the liver due to alcohol use.

The patient received 6 units of packed red blood cells, 2 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate. A CT abdomen/pelvis revealed diffuse colonic bowel wall thickening, large left rectus sheath fluid collection, small bilateral pleural effusions, and diffuse fat stranding throughout the mesentary, which is concerning for an infectious source, possibly C-diff.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 134/74 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 543 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 32.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL, platelet count of 63 K/uL, and creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase of 130 IU/L and alkaline phosphatase of 104 IU/L.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to altered mental status and respiratory failure. The patient is not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's C-diff infection and diffuse colonic bowel wall thickening on CT scan increase the risk of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's liver dysfunction and kidney failure may worsen if not properly managed.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's colonic bowel wall thickening and large left rectus sheath fluid collection may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory failure may increase the risk of infection.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical condition. The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C-diff) infection, which has led to diffuse colonic bowel wall thickening, a large left rectus sheath fluid collection, and small bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient has received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells, 2 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and rectus sheath hematoma. The patient is also receiving antibiotics, including metronidazole and piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 134/74 mmHg. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of multi-organ dysfunction, including thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and electrolyte imbalance. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, and the patient has mild hyperglycemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Sepsis and septic shock due to the C-diff infection and DIC.
2. Hemorrhagic complications due to the rectus sheath hematoma and coagulopathy.
3. Respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying lung disease and mechanical ventilation.
4. Renal failure due to the patient's electrolyte imbalance and potential hypovolemia.
5. Cardiac complications due to the patient's underlying cardiac disease and potential cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Neurological complications due to the patient's underlying neurological disease and potential hypoxia.
7. Gastrointestinal complications due to the C-diff infection and potential bowel perforation.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications, close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent further deterioration and improve the patient's outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure, consistent with
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #Hypotension:  Patient afebrile but with worsening difficulty weaning
   off levophed, leukocytosis, DIC concerning for sepsis.  Potential
   sources of infection include respiratory although stable on ventilator,
   C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   -blood cultures
   -urine culture
   - trend lactate
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast today
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl day 1
   [**2147-4-29**]
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP if PICC is a power PICC
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP (now at 10);
   last ABG within normal limits.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (will attempt
   to get PEEP under 10, check RSBI)
   - propofol sedation for patient comfort
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
   low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Total transfusions over
   last 2 days: 9 units pRBCs, 5 units cryo, 2 units platelets, 5 units
   FFP.
   -[**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   -DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices.  Recently menstruating but bleeding
   minimal.  Total transfusions over last 2 days: 9 units pRBCs, 5 units
   cryo, 2 units platelets, 5 units FFP. Patient with rectus sheath bleed
   on imaging.
   -serial HCT Q6hr
   -transfuse for HCT <24
   - guaiac stools
   -blood smear for schistocytes
   - consider NGT lavage
   -F/U final read CT abdomen/pelvis
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR is
   worsening to 3.4 this morning. Bilirubin slightly increased.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets downtrending
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis; obtain CT abd/pelvis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**5-1**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be slightly positive today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely)
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - monitor for infection and culture if spikes
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   ..
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cx also with yeast; complete 5 day fluconazole
   course and repeat UA.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Continue tx with fluconazole for 5 day course started [**4-25**]
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   last 2 days: 9 units pRBCs, 5 units cryo, 2 units platelets, 5 units
   FFP.
   -[**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   -DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices.  Recently menstruating but bleeding
   minimal.  Total transfusions over last 2 days: 9 units pRBCs, 5 units
   cryo, 2 units platelets, 5 units FFP. Patient with rectus sheath bleed
   on imaging.
   -serial HCT Q6hr
   -transfuse for HCT <24
   - guaiac stools
   -blood smear for schistocytes
   - consider NGT lavage
   -F/U final read CT abdomen/pelvis
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR is
   worsening to 3.4 this morning. Bilirubin slightly increased.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets downtrending
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis; obtain CT abd/pelvis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**5-1**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be slightly positive today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely)
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - monitor for infection and culture if spikes
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   ..
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cx also with yeast; complete 5 day fluconazole
   course and repeat UA.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Continue tx with fluconazole for 5 day course started [**4-25**]
   .

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes. She has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. She has a rectus sheath hematoma and is at risk for bleeding. She has a low platelet count and is receiving blood products to support her coagulopathy. She has a high risk of developing sepsis and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's risk of developing sepsis is high due to her liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes. She has a high white blood cell count and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and coagulopathy make her at risk for bleeding. She has a rectus sheath hematoma and is receiving blood products to support her coagulopathy.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes are likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, although the differential diagnosis also includes medication effect and active infection.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal failure is likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).
5. Liver Failure: The patient's liver failure is secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis, and her INR is worsening.
6. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing infection due to her liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes.
7. DIC: The patient's low platelet count and coagulopathy make her at risk for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to active bleeding, hemolysis, or DIC.
9. UTI: The patient has a yeast infection and is at risk for developing a urinary tract infection (UTI).
10. VAP: The patient is at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to her prolonged intubation.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires ongoing close monitoring of her liver and renal function, as well as her mental status and bleeding risk. She should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential sepsis. Her coagulopathy should be managed with blood products and anticoagulants as necessary. Her bleeding risk should be closely monitored, and she should receive platelet transfusions as needed. Her mental status changes should be managed with lactulose and rifaximin, and she should receive serial labs to monitor her coagulation and liver function. She should also receive prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following key information:

* The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, alcoholic hepatitis, and renal failure.
* She is currently sedated and unable to provide a history, and her encephalopathy is severe.
* Her laboratory results show severe anemia (Hct 21%), elevated white blood cell count (14.4), and elevated liver enzymes (ALT 70, AST 130).
* She has a history of cirrhosis of the liver, likely due to alcohol use.
* She has a rectus sheath hematoma, which may be causing her Hct to drop.
* She has a large amount of fluid accumulation, including ascites and edema in her lower extremities.
* She is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and anticoagulants.
* She is being treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and has a dialysis catheter in place.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Further bleeding from the rectus sheath hematoma, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure.
* Development of septic shock due to her underlying cirrhosis and potential bacterial infections.
* Progression of her liver failure, which could lead to multi-organ failure and death.
* Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to her respiratory failure and potential pneumonia.
* Further fluid accumulation, which could lead to worsening edema and respiratory failure.
* Development of bleeding diathesis due to her coagulopathy, which could lead to further bleeding and organ failure.

Given the patient's critical condition, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely and adjusting her treatment plan as needed to prevent these potential complications and improve her chances of survival."

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 BRADYCARDIA
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 HEPATORENAL SYNDROME
 .H/O CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure,
   consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Total transfusions from
   [**Date range (1) 11993**]: 11 units pRBCs, 3 units cryo, 4 units platelets, 7 units
   FFP.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices.  Recently menstruating but bleeding
   minimal. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on imaging.
   -serial HCT Q6hr
   -transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - blood smear for schistocytes (negative)
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty weaning off
   levophed (not currently on), leukocytosis, DIC concerning for sepsis.
   Potential sources of infection include respiratory although stable on
   ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - ngtd
   - urine culture
 growing yeast
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.4 (stable)
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout the mesentary.
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl (day 1 -
   [**2147-4-29**])
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 8).
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - PSV as tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated
   - propofol sedation for patient comfort
   .
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR is
   worsening to 3.4 this morning. Bilirubin slightly increased.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**5-1**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

* The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now with mental status changes, worsening renal failure, consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.
* She has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status.
* The patient has a significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14, and there is concern for active bleeding, hemolysis, or DIC. She has a large left rectus sheath fluid collection that appears to be blood.
* She has a platelet count of 41 and is on blood thinners, which may be contributing to the bleeding.
* The patient has a history of C. difficile-associated disease, which may be contributing to the colonic bowel wall thickening seen on CT scan.
* She has a MELD score of 45, which indicates a poor prognosis.
* The patient is on CVVH and has a urine output of 11 mL, which is concerning for acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
* She has a high lactate level of 1.4 mmol/L, which may indicate sepsis or liver failure.
* The patient has a positive blood culture for yeast and a urine culture pending.
* She has a diagnosis of fulminant hepatic failure, which is likely due to her history of alcoholism.
* The patient's condition is considered poor, and a family meeting is planned to discuss her clinical status and goals of care.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Continued bleeding and hemorrhage due to coagulopathy and liver failure
* Worsening renal failure and need for dialysis
* Development of sepsis and septic shock
* Increased risk of pneumonia and respiratory failure
* Potential for further liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy
* Risk of bleeding complications from anticoagulant therapy
* Need for further management of C. difficile-associated disease
* Potential for further worsening of mental status and need for sedation
* Risk of complications from CVVH, such as bleeding and infection."

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 BRADYCARDIA
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 HEPATORENAL SYNDROME
 .H/O CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure,
   consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Total transfusions from
   [**Date range (1) 11993**]: 11 units pRBCs, 3 units cryo, 4 units platelets, 7 units
   FFP.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >150
   - DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging.
   -serial HCT Q8hr
   -transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - blood smear for schistocytes (negative)
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (not currently on), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - ngtd
   - urine culture
 growing yeast
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.4 (stable)
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl (day 1 -
   [**2147-4-29**])
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 8).
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - propofol sedation for patient comfort
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**Date range (1) 11995**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]; however repeat
   culture on [**4-28**] still with yeast so will continue fluconazole from
   [**Date range (1) 11994**]
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: R arm power PICC, A-line, HD catheter
   # Communication: Boyfriend [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11865**]
   # Code:  Full; no formal HCP - code status discussed with Brother [**Name (NI) **]
   and boyfriend [**Name (NI) **]; will readdress today
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
 will likely require
   family meeting to discuss clinical status/goals of care

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 HEPATORENAL SYNDROME
 .H/O CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure,
   consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Total transfusions from
   [**Date range (1) 11993**]: 11 units pRBCs, 3 units cryo, 4 units platelets, 7 units
   FFP.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >150
   - DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging.
   -serial HCT Q8hr
   -transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - blood smear for schistocytes (negative)
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (not currently on), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - ngtd
   - urine culture
 growing yeast
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.4 (stable)
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl (day 1 -
   [**2147-4-29**])
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 8).
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - propofol sedation for patient comfort
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**Date range (1) 11995**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]; however repeat
   culture on [**4-28**] still with yeast so will continue fluconazole from
   [**Date range (1) 11994**]
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: R arm power PICC, A-line, HD catheter
   # Communication: Boyfriend [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11865**]

Based on the provided medical note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

* The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and altered mental status.
* She has been diagnosed with acute hepatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, and likely has hepatic encephalopathy.
* The patient has a significant drop in hematocrit, likely due to active bleeding, and is being treated with blood transfusions.
* She has a low platelet count and is being treated with platelet transfusions.
* The patient has a high risk of bleeding due to her coagulopathy and is being treated with DDAVP.
* She has a high risk of infection, likely due to her liver failure and sepsis.
* The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status.
* She has a high risk of respiratory failure and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
* The patient has a high risk of liver failure and is being treated with lactulose, rifaximin, and midodrine.
* She has a high risk of acute renal failure and is being treated with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).
* The patient has a high risk of mental status changes and is being treated with propofol sedation.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Continued bleeding due to coagulopathy and active bleeding.
2. Infection, likely due to sepsis, and the risk of septic shock.
3. Respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage.
4. Liver failure, likely due to acute hepatitis or cirrhosis.
5. Acute renal failure, likely due to ATN or HRS.
6. Mental status changes, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy or medication effects.
7. UTI, likely due to yeast infection.

The patient's current condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent complications and improve her clinical status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to her altered mental status, leukocytosis, and DIC.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver failure may lead to worsening encephalopathy, which can be life-threatening.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further hypoxia and respiratory acidosis.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed properly.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's DIC may lead to bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
6. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory failure may increase her risk of developing pneumonia or other infections.
7. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's liver failure may lead to worsening renal failure, which can be life-threatening.
8. Cardiac complications: The patient's liver failure may lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.

To manage these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and treatment. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and she should be weaned off mechanical ventilation as tolerated. The patient's liver function should be closely monitored, and she should receive treatment for liver failure, including lactulose and rifaximin. The patient's renal function should be monitored, and she should receive treatment for acute renal failure, including CVVH. The patient's coagulopathy should be managed with platelet transfusions and FFP. The patient's infection should be treated with antibiotics, and her mental status should be closely monitored for signs of worsening encephalopathy."

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 BRADYCARDIA
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 HEPATORENAL SYNDROME
 .H/O CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
   consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #Hypotension:  Patient afebrile but with worsening difficulty weaning
   off levophed, leukocytosis, DIC concerning for sepsis.  Potential
   sources of infection include respiratory although stable on ventilator,
   C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   -blood cultures
   -urine culture
   - trend lactate
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast today
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl day 1
   [**2147-4-29**]
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP if PICC is a power PICC
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP (now at 10);
   last ABG within normal limits.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (will attempt
   to get PEEP under 10, check RSBI)
   - propofol sedation for patient comfort
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
   low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Total transfusions over
   last 2 days: 9 units pRBCs, 5 units cryo, 2 units platelets, 5 units
   FFP.
   -[**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   -DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices.  Recently menstruating but bleeding
   minimal.  Total transfusions over last 2 days: 9 units pRBCs, 5 units
   cryo, 2 units platelets, 5 units FFP. Patient with rectus sheath bleed
   on imaging.
   -serial HCT Q6hr
   -transfuse for HCT <24
   - guaiac stools
   -blood smear for schistocytes
   - consider NGT lavage
   -F/U final read CT abdomen/pelvis
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR is
   worsening to 3.4 this morning. Bilirubin slightly increased.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets downtrending
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis; obtain CT abd/pelvis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**5-1**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be slightly positive today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely)
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - monitor for infection and culture if spikes
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   ..
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cx also with yeast; complete 5 day fluconazole
   course and repeat UA.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Continue tx with fluconazole for 5 day course started [**4-25**]

 BRADYCARDIA
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 HEPATORENAL SYNDROME
 .H/O CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
   consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #Hypotension:  Patient afebrile but with worsening difficulty weaning
   off levophed, leukocytosis, DIC concerning for sepsis.  Potential
   sources of infection include respiratory although stable on ventilator,
   C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   -blood cultures
   -urine culture
   - trend lactate
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast today
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl day 1
   [**2147-4-29**]
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP if PICC is a power PICC
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP (now at 10);
   last ABG within normal limits.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (will attempt
   to get PEEP under 10, check RSBI)
   - propofol sedation for patient comfort
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
   low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Total transfusions over
   last 2 days: 9 units pRBCs, 5 units cryo, 2 units platelets, 5 units
   FFP.
   -[**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   -DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices.  Recently menstruating but bleeding
   minimal.  Total transfusions over last 2 days: 9 units pRBCs, 5 units
   cryo, 2 units platelets, 5 units FFP. Patient with rectus sheath bleed
   on imaging.
   -serial HCT Q6hr
   -transfuse for HCT <24
   - guaiac stools
   -blood smear for schistocytes
   - consider NGT lavage
   -F/U final read CT abdomen/pelvis
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. INR is
   worsening to 3.4 this morning. Bilirubin slightly increased.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets downtrending
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis; obtain CT abd/pelvis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**5-1**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be slightly positive today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely)
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - monitor for infection and culture if spikes
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   ..
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cx also with yeast; complete 5 day fluconazole
   course and repeat UA.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Continue tx with fluconazole for 5 day course started [**4-25**]
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: R arm power PICC, A-line, HD catheter

   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP if PICC is a power PICC
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload (very little UOP and positive fluid balance of 4 L for
   LOS) and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP (now at 10);
   last ABG within normal limits.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Attempt PSV when tolerated; decrease PEEP as tolerated (will attempt
   to get PEEP under 10, check RSBI)
   - propofol sedation for patient comfort
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
   low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Total transfusions over
   last 2 days: 9 units pRBCs, 5 units cryo, 2 units platelets, 5 units
   FFP.

   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices.  Recently menstruating but bleeding
   minimal.  Total transfusions over last 2 days: 9 units pRBCs, 5 units

   worsening to 3.4 this morning. Bilirubin slightly increased.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets downtrending
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis; obtain CT abd/pelvis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**5-1**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be slightly positive today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely)
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - monitor for infection and culture if spikes
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   ..
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cx also with yeast; complete 5 day fluconazole
   course and repeat UA.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Continue tx with fluconazole for 5 day course started [**4-25**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be slightly positive today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely)
   - serial labs to monitor coags and LFTs
   - monitor for infection and culture if spikes
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures
   - consider tap of abdomen under U/S if tappable pocket
   - prednisone started 4/12 per liver team
   ..
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cx also with yeast; complete 5 day fluconazole
   course and repeat UA.
   - Repeat culture [**4-24**] also with yeast
   - Continue tx with fluconazole for 5 day course started [**4-25**]
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcoholism, cirrhosis of the liver, and acute liver failure. She is currently in the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient has a significant drop in hematocrit from 24 to 14, and is receiving multiple blood transfusions. She also has a low platelet count and is receiving platelet transfusions.
3. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient has a low platelet count and is receiving platelet transfusions. She also has increased thrombin generation and fibrinolysis, which may be contributing to her bleeding.
4. Anemia: The patient has a significant drop in hematocrit and is receiving multiple blood transfusions.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has altered mental status and is receiving lactulose and rifaximin.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient is anuric and has a creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL.
7. UTI: The patient has a yeast infection and is receiving empiric treatment with fluconazole.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's low platelet count and increased thrombin generation may be contributing to her bleeding.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's respiratory failure and hypoxia may lead to pulmonary edema.
3. GI bleeding: The patient's anemia and low platelet count may be contributing to her bleeding.
4. Liver failure: The patient's acute liver failure may lead to fulminant hepatic failure.
5. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may lead to chronic kidney disease.
6. Infection: The patient's UTI and yeast infection may lead to sepsis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory values.
2. Continue to provide supportive care, including mechanical ventilation and blood transfusions.
3. Consider US-guided paracentesis to drain the patient's ascites.
4. Continue lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Consider fluconazole for UTI.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust IV fluids accordingly.
7. Consider consulting a nephrologist for the patient's acute renal failure.
8. Consider consulting a gastroenterologist for the patient's liver failure.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust sedation accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis of the liver due to alcohol use, who is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe septic shock, blood loss anemia, and respiratory failure. She has a rectus sheath hematoma and is receiving multiple medications, including vasopressors, antibiotics, and antifungals. Her laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 25%, platelet count of 43,000, and elevated liver enzymes. She is intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 626 mL. Her blood pressure is 112/104 mmHg, heart rate is 78 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is 92%.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient's rectus sheath hematoma and hypotension may worsen, leading to further blood loss and potential organ failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is high, and her tidal volume is elevated, which may indicate further respiratory distress or failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock may progress, leading to multi-organ failure, including hepatic, renal, and cardiovascular failure.
4. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's liver dysfunction and renal failure may worsen, leading to further organ failure.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's platelet count is low, and her liver enzymes are elevated, which may indicate a risk of bleeding or coagulopathy.
6. Infection: The patient's septic shock may be caused by an underlying infection, which may not have been fully treated or may be resistant to antibiotics.
7. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output may indicate acute kidney injury, which may worsen if not managed promptly.
8. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver dysfunction may worsen, leading to further encephalopathy and potential coma.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status.
2. Optimize vasopressor therapy to maintain adequate blood pressure and perfusion.
3. Continue antibiotics and antifungals as prescribed, and consider adding additional antibiotics if the patient's septic shock does not improve.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider increasing the tidal volume or adjusting the ventilator settings as necessary.
5. Consider consulting a hepatologist to discuss the patient's liver dysfunction and potential treatment options.
6. Monitor the patient's coagulation status closely and consider transfusing platelets or fresh frozen plasma if necessary.
7. Consider performing daily wake-up and spontaneous breathing trials to assess the patient's readiness for extubation.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and consider initiating dialysis if necessary."

   [**2147-5-1**] CXR: Lung volumes have improved substantially. Pulmonary edema
   has almost cleared, and heart size, upper limits of normal has
   improved. Questioned regions of pneumonia in both lower lungs are less
   radiodense but this may reflect resorption of edema and better aeration
   rather than real improvement. ET tube is in standard placement and a
   feeding tube ends barely in the upper stomach. No pneumothorax. Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are likely.

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure,
   consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 8). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions from [**Date range (1) 11993**]: 11 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 4
   units platelets, 7 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets
   so treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >150
   - DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging.
   - serial HCT Q8hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - ngtd
   - urine culture
 growing yeast
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.4 (stable)
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl (day 1 -
   [**2147-4-29**])
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**Date range (1) 11995**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trending up to 17.8 today.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - C. diff from today pending (negative from [**4-30**])
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]; however repeat

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure,
   consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 8). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions from [**Date range (1) 11993**]: 11 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 4
   units platelets, 7 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets
   so treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >150
   - DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging.
   - serial HCT Q8hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - ngtd
   - urine culture
 growing yeast
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.4 (stable)
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl (day 1 -
   [**2147-4-29**])
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**Date range (1) 11995**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trending up to 17.8 today.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - C. diff from today pending (negative from [**4-30**])
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]; however repeat
   culture on [**4-28**] still with yeast so will continue fluconazole from
   [**Date range (1) 11994**]

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. The patient has a platelet count of 43, fibrinogen of 107 mg/dL, and INR of 2.2, consistent with thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. She has a MELD score of 45 and is at high risk for bleeding, sepsis, and infection.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient has a high risk of bleeding due to her thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. She has already received 11 units of pRBCs, 4 units of cryo, 4 units of platelets, and 7 units of FFP.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of sepsis due to her immunocompromised state and the presence of yeast in her urine and stool cultures.
3. Infection: The patient has a high risk of infection due to her immunocompromised state and the presence of yeast in her urine and stool cultures.
4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure and is at high risk of developing chronic renal failure.
5. Liver failure: The patient has acute liver failure and is at high risk of developing chronic liver disease.
6. Neurological complications: The patient has mental status changes and is at high risk of developing neurological complications such as seizures, coma, or death.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a high risk of cardiovascular complications such as cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, or death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count, fibrinogen, and INR to ensure that she is not bleeding excessively.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her fluid management and dialysis accordingly.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and adjust her treatment accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust her treatment accordingly.
5. Consider the patient's risk of sepsis and infection and adjust her treatment accordingly.
6. Consider the patient's risk of cardiovascular complications and adjust her treatment accordingly.
7. Consider the patient's risk of bleeding and adjust her treatment accordingly.

Note: The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and adjustments to her treatment plan to ensure her safety and optimal care."

   IMAGES:
   [**2147-5-1**] RUE ultrasound: No evidence for right upper extremity DVT.
   [**2147-5-1**] CXR: Lung volumes have improved substantially. Pulmonary edema
   has almost cleared, and heart size, upper limits of normal has
   improved. Questioned regions of pneumonia in both lower lungs are less
   radiodense but this may reflect resorption of edema and better aeration
   rather than real improvement. ET tube is in standard placement and a
   feeding tube ends barely in the upper stomach. No pneumothorax. Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are likely.
   [**2147-5-2**] CXR: Report pending
   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure,
   consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 8). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions from [**Date range (1) 11993**]: 11 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 4
   units platelets, 7 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets
   so treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >150
   - DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging.
   - serial HCT Q8hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - ngtd
   - urine culture
 growing yeast
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.4 (stable)
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl (day 1 -
   [**2147-4-29**])
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**Date range (1) 11995**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trending up to 17.8 today.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - C. diff from today pending (negative from [**4-30**])
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]; however repeat
   culture on [**4-28**] still with yeast so will continue fluconazole from
   [**Date range (1) 11994**]
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: R arm power PICC, A-line, HD catheter
   # Communication: Boyfriend [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11865**]
   # Code:  Full; no formal HCP - code status discussed with Brother [**Name (NI) **]
   and boyfriend [**Name (NI) **]; will readdress today
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
 will likely require
   family meeting to discuss clinical status/goals of care

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above

   - Continue broad spectrum Abx
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]; however repeat
   culture on [**4-28**] still with yeast so will continue fluconazole from

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and mental status changes. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. She has thrombocytopenia and is at risk for bleeding. She has a history of rectus sheath bleed on imaging. Her liver function tests are abnormal, and she has a MELD score of 45. She has acute renal failure and is anuric. She has a yeast infection and is receiving treatment with fluconazole. She is also receiving treatment for possible sepsis and has a broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and history of rectus sheath bleed put her at risk for bleeding. She needs to be closely monitored for signs of bleeding, and her platelet count should be maintained above 50,000.
2. Infection: The patient has a yeast infection and is at risk for sepsis. She needs to be closely monitored for signs of infection, and her antibiotic regimen should be adjusted accordingly.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and she has a MELD score of 45. She is at risk for further liver failure and needs to be closely monitored for signs of liver failure.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure and is anuric. She needs to be closely monitored for signs of renal recovery, and her dialysis regimen should be adjusted accordingly.
5. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status changes are likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, but the differential diagnosis also includes medication effect from ativan or active infection. She needs to be closely monitored for signs of mental status changes, and her treatment regimen should be adjusted accordingly.
6. Volume Overload: The patient has volume overload and is at risk for further volume overload. She needs to be closely monitored for signs of volume overload, and her fluid management regimen should be adjusted accordingly.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows regions of pneumonia in both lower lungs. She needs to be closely monitored for signs of pneumonia, and her antibiotic regimen should be adjusted accordingly.
8. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to her yeast infection and her broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen. She needs to be closely monitored for signs of sepsis, and her antibiotic regimen should be adjusted accordingly.
9. DIC: The patient has a low platelet count and is at risk for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She needs to be closely monitored for signs of DIC, and her treatment regimen should be adjusted accordingly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust her treatment regimen accordingly.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function tests and adjust her treatment regimen accordingly.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her dialysis regimen accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust her treatment regimen accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's volume status and adjust her fluid management regimen accordingly.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her ventilator settings accordingly.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's infection status and adjust her antibiotic regimen accordingly.
8. Consider performing a liver biopsy to further evaluate the patient's liver function.
9. Consider performing a renal biopsy to further evaluate the patient's renal function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and volume overload. The patient has a significant drop in hematocrit, likely due to coagulopathy on prednisone, and is at risk for active bleeding. She has also developed DIC, likely secondary to liver failure. The patient has a high MELD score, indicating a poor prognosis. She is receiving treatment for liver failure, including lactulose, rifaximin, and midodrine, and is also being treated for possible sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and coagulopathy on prednisone put her at risk for active bleeding. She has already developed a rectus sheath bleed and is at risk for further bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to her underlying liver disease, DIC, and possible infection. She has already developed a UTI and is at risk for further infections.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to ATN, and she is at risk for further renal damage.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's liver failure is likely to progress, and she is at risk for fulminant hepatic failure.
5. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes are likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, and she is at risk for further deterioration.
6. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to her underlying liver disease, DIC, and possible infection.
7. VAP: The patient is at risk for VAP due to her intubation and underlying respiratory disease.
8. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to her immobility and underlying liver disease.

Recommendations:

1. Continue treatment for liver failure, including lactulose, rifaximin, and midodrine.
2. Monitor the patient's platelet count and coagulation profile closely to prevent bleeding.
3. Treat the patient's UTI with empiric antibiotics and continue to monitor for signs of sepsis.
4. Continue to treat the patient's acute renal failure with CVVH and consider renal consultation.
5. Monitor the patient's mental status closely and consider further treatment for hepatic encephalopathy.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider further treatment for VAP.
7. Consider prophylactic treatment for DVT.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust treatment as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a [age] year-old [male/female] admitted to the ICU with [initial diagnosis]. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 94 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 123/69 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes a FiO2 of 40% and a PEEP of 8 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.8 g/dL
* Platelet count: 57 K/uL
* WBC count: 17.0
* Hct: 25.2%
* Cr: 1.6 mg/dL
* TCO2: 24 mmHg
* Glucose: 95 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.5 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.5 g/dL
* LDH: 257 IU/L
* Ca++: 9.0 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL
* PO4: 2.1 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* RUE ultrasound: No evidence of right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
* CXR: Lung volumes have improved, and pulmonary edema has almost cleared. There are questioned regions of pneumonia in both lower lungs.

The patient's physical examination is significant for:

* Jaundice
* Scleral icterus
* Mildly firm abdomen with minimal facial response to palpation
* 3+ edema to abdomen bilaterally
* 2+ pulses

The patient's plan includes:

* Nutrition: Full enteral nutrition with Nutren 2.0 at 25 mL/hour
* Glycemic control: Target blood glucose level of 100-140 mg/dL
* Lines: PICC line, dialysis catheter, and arterial line in place
* Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis with sequential compression devices, stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole, and VAP prophylaxis with elevation of the head of the bed

Potential medical complications that may arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis: Given the patient's presence of pneumonia and jaundice, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Despite the negative RUE ultrasound, there is still a risk of developing DVT, especially given the patient's immobility and presence of central lines.
* Pulmonary embolism: Given the patient's presence of pneumonia and jaundice, there is a risk of developing pulmonary embolism.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: Given the patient's presence of jaundice and mildly firm abdomen, there is a risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Renal failure: Given the patient's presence of sepsis and jaundice, there is a risk of developing renal failure.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   IMAGES:
   [**2147-5-1**] RUE ultrasound: No evidence for right upper extremity DVT.
   [**2147-5-1**] CXR: Lung volumes have improved substantially. Pulmonary edema
   has almost cleared, and heart size, upper limits of normal has
   improved. Questioned regions of pneumonia in both lower lungs are less
   radiodense but this may reflect resorption of edema and better aeration
   rather than real improvement. ET tube is in standard placement and a
   feeding tube ends barely in the upper stomach. No pneumothorax. Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are likely.
   [**2147-5-2**] CXR: Report pending (ETT appears very close to carina,
   worsening left lower opacity)
   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 8). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions from [**Date range (1) 11993**]: 11 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 4
   units platelets, 7 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets
   so treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging.
   - serial HCT Q8hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - ngtd
   - urine culture
 growing yeast
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.4 (stable)
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl (day 1 -
   [**2147-4-29**]) for empiric 8 day course for possible VAP (will obtain sputum
   culture to guide antibiotics)
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**Date range (1) 11995**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trending up to 17.8 today.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - C. diff from today pending (negative from [**4-30**]); treating empirically
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]; however repeat
   culture on [**4-28**] still with yeast so will continue fluconazole from
   [**Date range (1) 11994**]
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   [**2147-5-1**] CXR: Lung volumes have improved substantially. Pulmonary edema
   has almost cleared, and heart size, upper limits of normal has
   improved. Questioned regions of pneumonia in both lower lungs are less
   radiodense but this may reflect resorption of edema and better aeration
   rather than real improvement. ET tube is in standard placement and a
   feeding tube ends barely in the upper stomach. No pneumothorax. Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are likely.
   [**2147-5-2**] CXR: Report pending (ETT appears very close to carina,
   worsening left lower opacity)
   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 8). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions from [**Date range (1) 11993**]: 11 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 4
   units platelets, 7 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets
   so treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging.
   - serial HCT Q8hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - ngtd
   - urine culture
 growing yeast
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.4 (stable)
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl (day 1 -
   [**2147-4-29**]) for empiric 8 day course for possible VAP (will obtain sputum
   culture to guide antibiotics)
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**Date range (1) 11995**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trending up to 17.8 today.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - C. diff from today pending (negative from [**4-30**]); treating empirically
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]; however repeat
   culture on [**4-28**] still with yeast so will continue fluconazole from
   [**Date range (1) 11994**]

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. She was intubated and started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and has been receiving multiple blood transfusions due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient has a rectus sheath bleed, and her platelet count has been stable at >50,000. She is also experiencing leukocytosis and has a positive urine culture for yeast.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. Weaning PEEP and considering extubation in the near future.
2. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient has low platelets with increased thrombin generation and increased fibrinolysis. Maintaining platelet count >50,000 and fibrinogen >100.
3. Anemia: The patient has a significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14, which may be due to active bleeding, hemolysis, or DIC. Serial HCT and transfusion for HCT <25.
4. Hypotension/possible infection: The patient is afebrile but has difficulty weaning off levophed, leukocytosis, and DIC, which may be due to sepsis. Trending lactate and considering CT abdomen with contrast.
5. Liver Failure: The patient has secondary liver failure due to acute alcoholic hepatitis. Monitoring liver labs and treating with lactulose and rifaximin.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has anuric acute renal failure, which may be due to ATN or HRS. Continuing CVVH and considering HD catheter placement.
7. Mental Status Changes: The patient has likely hepatic encephalopathy, which may be exacerbated by medication effects or active infection. Continuing rifaximin and lactulose and monitoring mental status.
8. Leukocytosis: The patient has trending up WBC count, which may be due to infection or inflammation. Trending CXR and considering pan-culture.
9. UTI: The patient has a positive urine culture for yeast and is being treated empirically with fluconazole.
10. FEN: The patient has volume overload, and IVF is being held off until electrolytes are replete and OG tube is in place.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is a high-risk patient with multiple organ dysfunction. The plan is to continue monitoring and managing her respiratory, cardiac, renal, and liver functions, as well as her mental status and potential infections. The patient's code status is full, and a family meeting will be held to discuss her clinical status and goals of care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status.

The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple potential complications, including:

1. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient has low platelets with increased thrombin generation and increased fibrinolysis, likely due to DIC or coagulopathy associated with severe liver disease on CVVH.
2. Anemia: The patient has a significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14, which may be due to active bleeding, hemolysis, or DIC.
3. Hypotension/possible infection: The patient has difficulty weaning off levophed, leukocytosis, and DIC, which may indicate sepsis.
4. Liver failure: The patient has acute liver failure secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis, with a MELD score of 45.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient has anuric acute renal failure likely due to ATN or HRS.
6. Mental status changes: The patient has likely hepatic encephalopathy, although the differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active infection.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient has a trending up WBC count, which may indicate infection or inflammation.
8. UTI: The patient has a yeast-positive urine culture, which may indicate a UTI.
9. FEN: The patient has fluid overload, which may require careful management to avoid further complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and DIC may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of anemia and liver failure.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and UTI may indicate a high risk of infection, which can worsen her underlying condition.
3. Renal failure: The patient's anuric acute renal failure may worsen if not managed appropriately.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver failure may worsen if not managed with lactulose and rifaximin, which may lead to increased risk of bleeding and infection.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypotension and difficulty weaning off levophed may indicate cardiac complications, which can worsen her underlying condition.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to monitor her closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage potential complications."

   [**2147-5-1**] CXR: Lung volumes have improved substantially. Pulmonary edema
   has almost cleared, and heart size, upper limits of normal has
   improved. Questioned regions of pneumonia in both lower lungs are less
   radiodense but this may reflect resorption of edema and better aeration
   rather than real improvement. ET tube is in standard placement and a
   feeding tube ends barely in the upper stomach. No pneumothorax. Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are likely.
   [**2147-5-2**] CXR: Report pending (ETT appears very close to carina)
   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure,
   consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 8). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions from [**Date range (1) 11993**]: 11 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 4
   units platelets, 7 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets
   so treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >150
   - DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging.
   - serial HCT Q8hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - ngtd
   - urine culture
 growing yeast
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.4 (stable)
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl (day 1 -
   [**2147-4-29**])
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**Date range (1) 11995**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trending up to 17.8 today.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - C. diff from today pending (negative from [**4-30**])
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]; however repeat
   culture on [**4-28**] still with yeast so will continue fluconazole from
   [**Date range (1) 11994**]
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: R arm power PICC, A-line, HD catheter
   # Communication: Boyfriend [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11865**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   [**2147-5-1**] RUE ultrasound: No evidence for right upper extremity DVT.
   [**2147-5-1**] CXR: Lung volumes have improved substantially. Pulmonary edema
   has almost cleared, and heart size, upper limits of normal has
   improved. Questioned regions of pneumonia in both lower lungs are less
   radiodense but this may reflect resorption of edema and better aeration
   rather than real improvement. ET tube is in standard placement and a
   feeding tube ends barely in the upper stomach. No pneumothorax. Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are likely.

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and now
   with mental status changes, worsening renal failure,
   consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 8). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands.
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions from [**Date range (1) 11993**]: 11 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 4
   units platelets, 7 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets
   so treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >150
   - DDAVP dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging.
   - serial HCT Q8hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - ngtd
   - urine culture
 growing yeast
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.4 (stable)
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - levophed to goal MAP >65  and wean as tolerated
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl (day 1 -
   [**2147-4-29**])
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone
 will re-evaluate after 1 week of treatment
   ([**Date range (1) 11995**])
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trending up to 17.8 today.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - C. diff from today pending (negative from [**4-30**])
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]; however repeat
   culture on [**4-28**] still with yeast so will continue fluconazole from
   [**Date range (1) 11994**]
   .

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism, who presents with acute liver failure and mental status changes, worsening renal failure, consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. She has a platelet count of 43, fibrinogen of 107 mg/dL, and INR of 2.2, suggesting thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has a MELD score of 45 and is at high risk for bleeding. She has a history of rectus sheath bleed on imaging.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to her acute liver failure, worsening mental status, and potential sepsis.
2. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient's platelet count is low, and she has a high INR, which may indicate a risk for bleeding.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped significantly, which may be due to active bleeding, hemolysis, or DIC.
4. Hypotension/possible infection: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she has a high lactate level, which may indicate sepsis.
5. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is severely impaired, which may lead to further complications such as encephalopathy, bleeding, and sepsis.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is severely impaired, which may lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and sepsis.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an infection or inflammation.
8. UTI: The patient's urinalysis shows yeast, which may indicate a urinary tract infection.
9. FEN: The patient's fluid overload is a concern, which may lead to further complications such as pulmonary edema, heart failure, and electrolyte imbalances.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation to support the patient's respiratory function.
2. Monitor the patient's platelet count and fibrinogen levels closely to assess the risk of bleeding.
3. Administer blood products as necessary to maintain a platelet count of >50K and a fibrinogen level of >150.
4. Continue lactulose and rifaximin to manage the patient's hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider hemodialysis if necessary.
6. Administer antibiotics empirically for potential sepsis.
7. Monitor the patient's urinalysis and consider treating a urinary tract infection if present.
8. Consider US-guided paracentesis to manage the patient's ascites.
9. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely to prevent imbalances.
10. Consider a family meeting to discuss the patient's clinical status and goals of care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old individual who has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a 24-hour history of worsening respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress.

The patient received 1 unit of Rh-positive platelets, which is not compatible with their Rh-negative status. The patient was administered WhinRho, an anti-D immunoglobulin, to prevent further hemolysis. The patient's RUE swelling and ecchymosis resolved without evidence of thrombus on ultrasound.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 123/69 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute, and their oxygen saturation is 99%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 561 mL, and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 43. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 26.7 mg/dL, and their creatinine is 1.6 mg/dL. The patient's liver enzymes, including alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), are elevated.

The patient's imaging studies, including a chest X-ray, show improved lung volumes, reduced pulmonary edema, and bilateral pleural effusions. The patient's upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract is patent, and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.

The patient's medical history includes a code status of do not resuscitate (DNR) and a disposition of ICU care.

Potential medical complications that may arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute, which is above the normal range. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99%, but they are receiving mechanical ventilation, which may indicate that they are at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and they have a history of infection. This may indicate that they are at risk for sepsis.
3. Bleeding: The patient received Rh-positive platelets, which is not compatible with their Rh-negative status. This may increase their risk of bleeding.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may indicate liver dysfunction.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine is elevated, which may indicate renal dysfunction.
6. GI bleeding: The patient's upper GI tract is patent, but they have a history of bleeding, which may increase their risk of GI bleeding.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows questioned regions of pneumonia in both lower lungs, which may indicate that they are at risk for pneumonia.
8. DVT: The patient received WhinRho, which may indicate that they are at risk for DVT.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including respiratory failure, sepsis, bleeding, liver dysfunction, renal dysfunction, GI bleeding, pneumonia, and DVT. It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent these complications and improve their outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   CXR [**2147-5-3**]: Report pending
   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 5). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands (will attempt SBT after new HD line placed)
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today after HD line
   in place
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP yesterday dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site yesterday PM after HD line
   removed.
   - serial HCT Q8hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - NGTD
   - urine culture
 grew yeast, treated with fluconazole
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.3 (stable)
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl (day 1 -
   [**2147-4-29**]) for empiric 8 day course for possible VAP (will obtain sputum
   culture to guide antibiotics)
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   - Currently off of levophed since [**2147-5-2**] (goal MAP > 65)
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone for presumed 28-day course (will confirm with
   liver team)
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trended up to 17.8 today, now down to 14.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - C. diff from today pending (negative from [**4-30**]); treating empirically
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]
   - Patient no longer making urine; if UOP resumes, would recheck UA/UCx
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trended up to 17.8 today, now down to 14.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - C. diff from today pending (negative from [**4-30**]); treating empirically
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]
   - Patient no longer making urine; if UOP resumes, would recheck UA/UCx
   .

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status.

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* Thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 57
* Coagulopathy with an INR of 2.2 and a fibrinogen level of 129 mg/dL
* Anemia with a hematocrit of 14
* Leukocytosis with a WBC count of 17.8
* Elevated liver enzymes with a AST of 101 and an ALT of 73
* Renal failure with an anion gap of 29 and a urine sodium of 29

The patient's medical conditions and complications include:

* Acute liver failure secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis
* Worsening renal failure likely due to ATN or HRS
* Hepatic encephalopathy with a discriminant function of 137
* Coagulopathy with DIC
* Leukocytosis with a WBC count of 17.8
* Anemia with a hematocrit of 14
* Respiratory failure with hypoxia and worsening mental status

The patient's medications include:

* Propofol for sedation
* Lactulose and rifaximin for liver failure
* Midodrine and octreotide for HRS
* Prednisone for presumed 28-day course
* Fluconazole for UTI
* Vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl for empiric 8-day course for possible VAP
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible sepsis

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitoring of liver labs and coagulation studies
* Trending of ABGs and lactate levels
* Daily wake-ups and weaning of PEEP
* Propofol sedation for patient comfort
* Continue lactulose and rifaximin for liver failure
* Continue midodrine and octreotide for HRS
* Continue prednisone for presumed 28-day course
* Continue TF with goal of >2137 calories/day
* Recheck vancomycin level and dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT
* Continue CVVH as tolerated
* Appreciate renal consult recommendations
* Monitor mental status and adjust propofol as needed
* Continue treatment for possible infection/sepsis

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued worsening of liver failure and encephalopathy
* Further deterioration of renal function
* Development of bleeding complications due to coagulopathy
* Infection/sepsis
* Respiratory failure due to hypoxia and worsening mental status
* Electrolyte imbalances due to fluid overload and diuretic therapy
* Nutritional deficiencies due to inadequate caloric intake

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's laboratory results, vital signs, and clinical status to address these potential complications and adjust the plan of care accordingly."

   opacities and mild retrocardiac opacify are unchanged. Low lung volumes
   are stable. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or large pleural
   effusions.
   CXR [**2147-5-3**]: Report pending
   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 5). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands (will attempt SBT after new HD line placed)
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today after HD line
   in place
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP yesterday dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site yesterday PM after HD line
   removed.
   - serial HCT Q8hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - NGTD
   - urine culture
 grew yeast, treated with fluconazole
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.3 (stable)
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl (day 1 -
   [**2147-4-29**]) for empiric 8 day course for possible VAP (will obtain sputum
   culture to guide antibiotics)
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   - Currently off of levophed since [**2147-5-2**] (goal MAP > 65)
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone for presumed 28-day course (will confirm with
   liver team)
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trended up to 17.8 today, now down to 14.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - C. diff from today pending (negative from [**4-30**]); treating empirically
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]
   - Patient no longer making urine; if UOP resumes, would recheck UA/UCx

   CXR [**2147-5-2**]: The endotracheal tube now terminates 2 cm above the
   carina. A feeding tube terminates in the proximal stomach. The
   cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Bibasilar parenchymal
   opacities and mild retrocardiac opacify are unchanged. Low lung volumes
   are stable. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or large pleural
   effusions.
   CXR [**2147-5-3**]: Report pending
   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 5). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands (will attempt SBT after new HD line placed)
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today after HD line
   in place
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP yesterday dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site yesterday PM after HD line
   removed.
   - serial HCT Q8hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - NGTD
   - urine culture
 grew yeast, treated with fluconazole
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.3 (stable)
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl (day 1 -
   [**2147-4-29**]) for empiric 8 day course for possible VAP (will obtain sputum
   culture to guide antibiotics)
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   - Currently off of levophed since [**2147-5-2**] (goal MAP > 65)
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone for presumed 28-day course (will confirm with
   liver team)
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated
 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trended up to 17.8 today, now down to 14.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - C. diff from today pending (negative from [**4-30**]); treating empirically
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]
   - Patient no longer making urine; if UOP resumes, would recheck UA/UCx
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: R arm power PICC, A-line, HD catheter

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism, acute liver failure, and worsening renal failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. She has developed DIC, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, and is at risk for sepsis and infection. Her liver function tests are abnormal, and she is experiencing fulminant hepatic failure. She has a MELD score of 45 and a prognosis is poor.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory compromise due to volume overload and worsening mental status. Weaning off mechanical ventilation may be challenging.
2. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient's platelet count is low, and she is at risk for further bleeding. Monitoring of platelet count and fibrinogen levels is essential.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped significantly, and she is at risk for further bleeding. Transfusion of packed red blood cells may be necessary.
4. Hypotension/possible infection: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she is at risk for sepsis and infection. Monitoring of lactate levels and trend of blood cultures is essential.
5. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and she is at risk for further liver damage. Monitoring of liver enzymes and coagulation studies is essential.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she is at risk for further renal damage. Monitoring of urine output and electrolyte levels is essential.
7. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status is deteriorating, and she is at risk for further decline. Monitoring of mental status and treatment of underlying causes is essential.
8. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and she is at risk for further infection. Monitoring of white blood cell count and trend of blood cultures is essential.
9. UTI: The patient's urine culture is growing yeast, and she is at risk for further infection. Treatment with fluconazole is necessary.
10. FEN: The patient is at risk for further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance. Monitoring of fluid status and electrolyte levels is essential.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and wean off as tolerated.
2. Monitor platelet count and fibrinogen levels closely and transfuse as necessary.
3. Transfuse packed red blood cells as necessary to maintain hematocrit.
4. Monitor lactate levels and trend of blood cultures to assess for sepsis and infection.
5. Monitor liver enzymes and coagulation studies to assess for liver damage.
6. Monitor urine output and electrolyte levels to assess for renal damage.
7. Monitor mental status and treat underlying causes of decline.
8. Monitor white blood cell count and trend of blood cultures to assess for infection.
9. Treat UTI with fluconazole and monitor for resolution.
10. Monitor fluid status and electrolyte levels to assess for FEN and adjust treatment as necessary."

   [**2147-4-28**] Blood culture x 2 NGTD
   Images:
   CXR [**2147-5-2**]: The endotracheal tube now terminates 2 cm above the
   carina. A feeding tube terminates in the proximal stomach. The
   cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Bibasilar parenchymal
   opacities and mild retrocardiac opacify are unchanged. Low lung volumes
   are stable. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or large pleural
   effusions.
   CXR [**2147-5-3**]: Report pending
   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 5). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands (will attempt SBT after new HD line placed)
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today after HD line
   in place
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP yesterday dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site yesterday PM after HD line
   removed.
   - serial HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - NGTD
   - urine culture
 grew yeast, treated with fluconazole
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.3 (stable)
   - check sputum culture
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn (day 1 - [**2147-4-29**]) for
   empiric 8 day course for possible VAP (will obtain sputum culture to
   guide antibiotics)
   - d/c PO vancomycin and IV flagyl as c.diff negative x2 and d/c c.diff
   precautions
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   - Currently off of levophed since [**2147-5-2**] (goal MAP > 65)
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone for presumed 28-day course
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - will discuss with renal plans for CVVH vs HD
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trended up to 17.8 today, now down to 14.
   C. Diff negative x2.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for HCAP but D/C PO vanc and IV flagyl for
   empiric coverage of C.difficile
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]
   - Patient no longer making urine; if UOP resumes, would recheck UA/UCx
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: R arm power PICC, A-line, HD catheter
   # Communication: Boyfriend [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11865**]
   # Code:  Full; no formal HCP - code status discussed with Brother [**Name (NI) **]
   and boyfriend [**Name (NI) **]; will readdress today
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
 will likely require
   family meeting to discuss clinical status/goals of care

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   CXR [**2147-5-3**]: Report pending
   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 5). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands (will attempt SBT after new HD line placed)
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today after HD line
   in place
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP yesterday dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site yesterday PM after HD line
   removed.
   - serial HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - NGTD
   - urine culture
 grew yeast, treated with fluconazole
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.3 (stable)
   - check sputum culture
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn (day 1 - [**2147-4-29**]) for
   empiric 8 day course for possible VAP (will obtain sputum culture to
   guide antibiotics)
   - d/c PO vancomycin and IV flagyl as c.diff negative x2 and d/c c.diff
   precautions
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   - Currently off of levophed since [**2147-5-2**] (goal MAP > 65)
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone for presumed 28-day course
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - will discuss with renal plans for CVVH vs HD
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trended up to 17.8 today, now down to 14.
   C. Diff negative x2.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for HCAP but D/C PO vanc and IV flagyl for
   empiric coverage of C.difficile
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]
   - Patient no longer making urine; if UOP resumes, would recheck UA/UCx
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: R arm power PICC, A-line, HD catheter
   # Communication: Boyfriend [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11865**]
   # Code:  Full; no formal HCP - code status discussed with Brother [**Name (NI) **]
   and boyfriend [**Name (NI) **]; will readdress today
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
 will likely require
   family meeting to discuss clinical status/goals of care

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has been intubated and started on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient's condition is complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), rectus sheath bleed, and possible sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status. Weaning off the ventilator is challenging, and the patient may require further respiratory support.
2. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient has low platelets with increased thrombin generation and increased fibrinolysis, which may lead to bleeding complications. Monitoring of platelet count and fibrinogen levels is essential to manage this condition.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped significantly, which may be due to active bleeding, hemolysis, or DIC. Serial HCT monitoring and transfusion of packed red blood cells may be necessary to manage this condition.
4. Hypotension/possible infection: The patient has difficulty weaning off levophed, leukocytosis, and DIC, which may indicate sepsis. Blood cultures, urine culture, and imaging studies are necessary to identify potential sources of infection.
5. Liver failure: The patient has acute liver failure secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis, which may lead to fulminant hepatic failure. Monitoring of liver enzymes and coagulation studies is essential to manage this condition.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient has anuria, which may be due to ATN or HRS. Renal consult recommendations and management of fluid and electrolyte imbalance are necessary to manage this condition.
7. Mental status changes: The patient has altered mental status due to hepatic encephalopathy, which may worsen if not managed promptly. Monitoring of mental status and treatment with rifaximin and lactulose are necessary.
8. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may indicate infection or inflammation. Monitoring of white blood cell count and treatment with antibiotics if necessary are essential.
9. UTI: The patient has a yeast-positive urine culture, which may indicate a UTI. Treatment with fluconazole and repeat urine cultures are necessary to manage this condition.
10. Fluid overload: The patient has volume overload, which may lead to further complications if not managed promptly. Monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is essential to manage this condition.

In summary, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical conditions to prevent complications and improve her clinical status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. Here is a summary of the patient's current status:

* The patient's dialysis catheter was removed, and a temporary HD line was placed by an interventional radiologist.
* The patient experienced significant bleeding from the right groin site, requiring 20-25 minutes of pressure dressing and administration of blood products.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 92/57 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute.
* The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on a FiO2 of 40%.
* The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O.
* The patient's laboratory results show:
	+ Hemoglobin: 9.9 g/dL
	+ Platelet count: 57 K/uL
	+ White blood cell count: 17.8 K/uL
	+ Blood urea nitrogen: 36 mg/dL
	+ Creatinine: 1.6 mg/dL
	+ Liver enzymes: Elevated ALT and AST
	+ Fibrinogen: 129 mg/dL
	+ Lactic acid: 1.3 mmol/L
* The patient's radiology reports show:
	+ Chest X-ray (CXR) [**2147-5-2**]: The endotracheal tube terminates 2 cm above the carina, with no evidence of pneumothorax or large pleural effusions.
	+ CXR [**2147-5-3**]: Report pending.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's significant bleeding from the right groin site may lead to further complications, such as hypovolemic shock, anemia, or even death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further respiratory distress, hypoxemia, or even respiratory arrest.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's liver disease and acute kidney injury may worsen, leading to further liver and kidney dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances, and even death.
4. Infections: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization may increase the risk of infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), or catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI).
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's bradycardia may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest, or the patient may develop arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment plans accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure the patient's optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 5). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands (will attempt SBT after new HD line placed)
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today after HD line
   in place
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP yesterday dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis

   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site yesterday PM after HD line
   removed.
   - serial HCT Q8hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage

   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - NGTD
   - urine culture
 grew yeast, treated with fluconazole
   - trend lactate

   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl (day 1 -

 UF 100-200 cc/hr, SBP>110 with goal to
   be even today.
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above

   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and worsening mental status.

The patient has a significant risk of developing medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to the patient's underlying liver disease and potential volume overload.
2. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient has low platelet counts and is at risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of liver disease and CVVH.
3. Anemia: The patient has a significant hematocrit drop, which may be due to active bleeding, hemolysis, or DIC.
4. Hypotension/possible infection: The patient is at risk of sepsis due to the presence of leukocytosis, DIC, and potential sources of infection, including respiratory, C. difficile, and SBP.
5. Liver failure: The patient has acute liver failure, which is likely secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis. The patient's liver function tests are trending downward, and the patient is at risk of further deterioration.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient has anuric renal failure, which is likely due to ATN or HRS. The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, and the patient is at risk of further renal deterioration.
7. Mental status changes: The patient has significant mental status changes, which are likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's mental status is fluctuating, and the patient is at risk of further deterioration.
8. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may be due to infection or inflammation.
9. UTI: The patient has a yeast infection in the urine, which may be due to a UTI.
10. FEN: The patient has a risk of fluid overload due to the presence of CVVH and IVF.

The patient's laboratory results are concerning, including:

* Low platelet counts
* Low fibrinogen levels
* Elevated lactate levels
* Elevated liver enzymes
* Elevated creatinine levels
* Anemia
* Leukocytosis
* Yeast infection in the urine

The patient's radiology results are concerning, including:

* CXR showing bibasilar parenchymal opacities and mild retrocardiac opacify
* CT abdomen/pelvis showing diffuse colonic bowel wall thickening and large left rectus sheath fluid collection

The patient's medical history is significant for acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes. The patient's underlying liver disease is likely secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* CVVH as tolerated
* FFP and DDAVP for bleeding
* Antibiotics for possible sepsis
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics for empiric treatment of possible VAP
* Fluconazole for yeast infection in the urine
* Lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
* Midodrine and octreotide for HRS
* Prednisone for presumed 28-day course
* TF with goal of >2137 calories/day
* HD catheter placement by renal service
* Renal consult recommendations
* Propofol sedation for patient comfort
* Daily wake-ups and weaning of PEEP
* Trending of ABGs and RSBIs
* Consideration of US-guided paracentesis
* Continue lactulose, rifaximin, and prednisone

The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement, and a family meeting will be necessary to discuss clinical status and goals of care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old woman with ETOH hepatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure. She has a history of cirrhosis of the liver and is currently receiving ICU care. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, and blood pressure of 117/55 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and is on a ventilator with a tidal volume of 502 mL and a respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, including AST and ALT, and decreased platelet count. Her hemoglobin level is 9.9 g/dL, and her white blood cell count is 17.8 x 10^9/L. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 26 mg/dL, and her creatinine level is 1.6 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, right lower extremity edema, and left lower extremity edema. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. Her neurologic examination shows altered mental status, but she is not delirious.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a major concern, and the possibility of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) cannot be ruled out.
2. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure is likely to continue, and the possibility of further deterioration cannot be ruled out.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's liver disease and renal failure increase the risk of hepatorenal syndrome, which can lead to further deterioration of both organs.
4. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and platelet dysfunction increase the risk of bleeding, particularly from the line site.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of central lines increase the risk of infection, particularly sepsis.
6. Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to encephalopathy, which can be a complication of liver disease and sepsis.
7. Shock: The patient's hypotension and decreased cardiac output increase the risk of shock, which can lead to further organ dysfunction.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's inability to eat and her high caloric needs increase the risk of malnutrition, which can exacerbate her other medical conditions.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's cirrhosis and portal hypertension increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
10. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac history and decreased cardiac output increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and heart failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload. Currently weaning PEEP (at 5 on [**5-4**]). Goal of
   extubation in near future given patient now following commands (will
   attempt SBT today [**5-4**])
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today
   - Goal net neg 2L today via CVVH
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP given in setting of femoral line bleed [**5-2**]
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis as below
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site [**5-2**] PM after HD line removed.
   - serial HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently off), leukocytosis, DIC concerning for
   sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory although
   stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - NGTD
   - urine culture
 grew yeast, treated with fluconazole
   - trend lactate
 [**5-4**] level 1.3 (stable)
   - sputum culture
 unclear quality of specimen; no commensals; sparse
   yeast
 consider getting [**Last Name (un) 206**]/spec and restarting antifungals
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - [**5-3**] discontinued PO vancomycin and IV flagyl as c.diff negative x2
   and d/c c.diff precautions
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn (day 1 - [**2147-4-29**]) for
   empiric 8 day course (to end [**5-7**]) for possible VAP (will attempt to
   obtain sputum culture to guide antibiotics). Will redose vanc today.
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   - Currently off of levophed since [**2147-5-2**] (goal MAP > 65)
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis if more ascites appreciable
   - Continue prednisone for presumed 28-day course; day 1 = [**4-24**]
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - Femoral HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]; removed [**5-2**]; new
   temp HD line placed [**5-3**]
   - will discuss with renal plans for CVVH vs HD
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Improving; when Propofol is lightened,
   patient is able to follow commands, nod head to Qs.. Likely due to
   hepatic encephalopathy, though differential also includes medication
   effect from ativan or active infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is
   likely given her history of alcoholism, acute liver failure and now
   encephalopathy. Initial discriminant function 137.  Per liver team,
   prognosis is poor given the trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these
   values appear ~stable or improving at this time.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - propofol only as needed for comfort
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC increased; C. Diff negative x2.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ?urine) if febrile
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for HCAP as above
   - Now off PO vanc and IV flagyl for empiric coverage of C.difficile
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course [**2055-4-24**]
   - Patient no longer making urine; if UOP resumes, would recheck UA/UCx
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload. Currently weaning PEEP (at 5 on [**5-4**]). Goal of
   extubation in near future given patient now following commands (will
   attempt SBT today [**5-4**])
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today
   - Goal net neg 2L today via CVVH
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP given in setting of femoral line bleed [**5-2**]
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis as below
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site [**5-2**] PM after HD line removed.
   - serial HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently off), leukocytosis, DIC concerning for
   sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory although
   stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - NGTD
   - urine culture
 grew yeast, treated with fluconazole
   - trend lactate
 [**5-4**] level 1.3 (stable)
   - sputum culture
 unclear quality of specimen; no commensals; sparse
   yeast
 consider getting [**Last Name (un) 206**]/spec and restarting antifungals
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - [**5-3**] discontinued PO vancomycin and IV flagyl as c.diff negative x2
   and d/c c.diff precautions
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn (day 1 - [**2147-4-29**]) for
   empiric 8 day course (to end [**5-7**]) for possible VAP (will attempt to
   obtain sputum culture to guide antibiotics). Will redose vanc today.
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   - Currently off of levophed since [**2147-5-2**] (goal MAP > 65)
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis if more ascites appreciable
   - Continue prednisone for presumed 28-day course; day 1 = [**4-24**]
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - Femoral HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]; removed [**5-2**]; new
   temp HD line placed [**5-3**]
   - will discuss with renal plans for CVVH vs HD
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Improving; when Propofol is lightened,
   patient is able to follow commands, nod head to Qs.. Likely due to
   hepatic encephalopathy, though differential also includes medication
   effect from ativan or active infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is
   likely given her history of alcoholism, acute liver failure and now
   encephalopathy. Initial discriminant function 137.  Per liver team,
   prognosis is poor given the trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these
   values appear ~stable or improving at this time.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - propofol only as needed for comfort
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC increased; C. Diff negative x2.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ?urine) if febrile
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for HCAP as above
   - Now off PO vanc and IV flagyl for empiric coverage of C.difficile
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course [**2055-4-24**]
   - Patient no longer making urine; if UOP resumes, would recheck UA/UCx
   .

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and volume overload.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate further, leading to respiratory arrest or failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and possible infection can progress to sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. DIC: The patient's thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy can worsen, leading to bleeding complications or disseminated intravascular coagulation.
4. Liver failure: The patient's liver function can continue to deteriorate, leading to further encephalopathy, bleeding, and death.
5. Renal failure: The patient's anuria can persist, leading to further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Infection: The patient's central line, urinary catheter, and other invasive devices can become infected, leading to sepsis and organ failure.
7. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and liver failure can lead to bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, or retroperitoneal bleeding.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or other complications.
9. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to eat or absorb nutrients can lead to malnutrition, weakness, and other complications.
10. Psychological distress: The patient's mental status changes and chronic illness can lead to psychological distress, anxiety, and depression.

To address these potential complications, the patient's care plan should include:

1. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and oxygenation.
2. Early recognition and treatment of sepsis and infection.
3. Aggressive management of DIC and coagulopathy.
4. Close monitoring of the patient's liver function and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Aggressive management of the patient's renal failure and fluid overload.
6. Prevention of bleeding complications through the use of anticoagulation therapy and careful monitoring of the patient's coagulation status.
7. Prevention of infection through the use of antibiotics and careful monitoring of the patient's temperature and white blood cell count.
8. Management of the patient's nutritional needs through the use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or enteral nutrition.
9. Psychological support and counseling to address the patient's mental status changes and chronic illness.
10. Close communication with the patient's family and caregivers to ensure that they are informed and involved in the patient's care."

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload. Currently weaning PEEP (at 5 on [**5-4**]). Goal of
   extubation in near future given patient now following commands (will
   attempt SBT today [**5-4**])
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today
   - Goal neg 100cc/h today via CVVH
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP given in setting of femoral line bleed [**5-2**]
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis as below
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site [**5-2**] PM after HD line removed.
   - serial HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently off), leukocytosis, DIC concerning for
   sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory although
   stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - NGTD
   - urine culture
 grew yeast, treated with fluconazole
   - trend lactate
 [**5-4**] level 1.3 (stable)
   - sputum culture
 unclear quality of specimen; no commensals; sparse
   yeast
 consider getting [**Last Name (un) 206**]/spec and restarting antifungals
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - [**5-3**] discontinued PO vancomycin and IV flagyl as c.diff negative x2
   and d/c c.diff precautions
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn (day 1 - [**2147-4-29**]) for
   empiric 8 day course (to end [**5-7**]) for possible VAP (will attempt to
   obtain sputum culture to guide antibiotics). Will redose vanc today.
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   - Currently off of levophed since [**2147-5-2**] (goal MAP > 65)
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis if more ascites appreciable
   - Continue prednisone for presumed 28-day course; day 1 = [**4-24**]
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - Femoral HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]; removed [**5-2**]; new
   temp HD line placed [**5-3**]
   - will discuss with renal plans for CVVH vs HD
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Improving; when Propofol is lightened,
   patient is able to follow commands, nod head to Qs.. Likely due to
   hepatic encephalopathy, though differential also includes medication
   effect from ativan or active infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is
   likely given her history of alcoholism, acute liver failure and now
   encephalopathy. Initial discriminant function 137.  Per liver team,
   prognosis is poor given the trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these
   values appear ~stable or improving at this time.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - propofol only as needed for comfort
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC increased; C. Diff negative x2.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ?urine) if febrile
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for HCAP as above
   - Now off PO vanc and IV flagyl for empiric coverage of C.difficile
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course [**2055-4-24**]
   - Patient no longer making urine; if UOP resumes, would recheck UA/UCx
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   intubated; will aim for net negative with CVVH and re-try tomorrow
   - Received 5 mg PO vitamin K
   - Concern by IR for ETT too high so got CXR; attending thought it
   looked OK so no intervention
   . Renal recs [**5-4**]

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload. Currently weaning PEEP (at 5 on [**5-4**]). Goal of
   extubation in near future given patient now following commands (will
   attempt SBT today [**5-4**])
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today
   - Goal neg 100cc/h today via CVVH
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.

   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP given in setting of femoral line bleed [**5-2**]
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis as below
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site [**5-2**] PM after HD line removed.
   - serial HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently off), leukocytosis, DIC concerning for
   sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory although
   stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.

   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - [**5-3**] discontinued PO vancomycin and IV flagyl as c.diff negative x2
   and d/c c.diff precautions
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn (day 1 - [**2147-4-29**]) for
   empiric 8 day course (to end [**5-7**]) for possible VAP (will attempt to
   obtain sputum culture to guide antibiotics). Will redose vanc today.
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   - Currently off of levophed since [**2147-5-2**] (goal MAP > 65)
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis if more ascites appreciable
   - Continue prednisone for presumed 28-day course; day 1 = [**4-24**]
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - Femoral HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]; removed [**5-2**]; new
   temp HD line placed [**5-3**]
   - will discuss with renal plans for CVVH vs HD
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Improving; when Propofol is lightened,
   patient is able to follow commands, nod head to Qs.. Likely due to
   hepatic encephalopathy, though differential also includes medication
   effect from ativan or active infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is
   likely given her history of alcoholism, acute liver failure and now
   encephalopathy. Initial discriminant function 137.  Per liver team,
   prognosis is poor given the trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these
   values appear ~stable or improving at this time.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - propofol only as needed for comfort
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC increased; C. Diff negative x2.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ?urine) if febrile
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for HCAP as above
   - Now off PO vanc and IV flagyl for empiric coverage of C.difficile
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course [**2055-4-24**]
   - Patient no longer making urine; if UOP resumes, would recheck UA/UCx

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and volume overload. The patient has a history of alcoholism and has developed DIC, rectus sheath bleed, and anemia. She is also at risk for infection, including sepsis, VAP, and UTI. The patient is currently receiving CVVH, propofol sedation, and antibiotics for empiric coverage of C. difficile.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the development of ARDS, which can lead to further hypoxia and respiratory acidosis.
2. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient's thrombocytopenia and DIC may worsen, leading to increased bleeding risk and potential for hemorrhage.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding and hemolysis, which can lead to further hypoxia and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Infection: The patient is at high risk for infection, including sepsis, VAP, and UTI, which can lead to further organ dysfunction and poor outcomes.
5. Liver Failure: The patient's liver failure may worsen, leading to further encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and decreased synthetic function.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen, leading to further fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and decreased clearance of waste products.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiovascular status may worsen due to the development of sepsis, which can lead to further hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and decreased cardiac output.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's gastrointestinal status may worsen due to the development of gut ischemia, which can lead to further bleeding, perforation, and sepsis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue CVVH and adjust as necessary to manage fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Monitor platelet count and fibrinogen levels closely to manage DIC and bleeding risk.
3. Administer antibiotics empirically for C. difficile and consider adding coverage for VAP and UTI.
4. Continue propofol sedation and consider adjusting as necessary to manage pain and anxiety.
5. Monitor liver function tests and coagulation studies closely to manage liver failure and DIC.
6. Consider adding antifungal therapy to cover possible fungal infections.
7. Monitor renal function and consider adjusting dialysis therapy as necessary to manage fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
8. Consider adding vasopressors to manage hypotension and cardiovascular instability.
9. Monitor gastrointestinal status and consider adding prophylactic antibiotics to prevent gut ischemia and sepsis."

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload. Currently weaning PEEP (at 5 on [**5-4**]). Goal of
   extubation in near future given patient now following commands (will
   attempt SBT today [**5-4**])
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP given in setting of femoral line bleed [**5-2**]
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis as below
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site [**5-2**] PM after HD line removed.
   - serial HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently off), leukocytosis, DIC concerning for
   sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory although
   stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - Liver: cont. steroids (may be help w/ t-bili) for 28 day course per
   liver
   - HD line placed by IR, renal rec re-start CVVH to remove volume
   - D/C PO vanc and IV flagyl as C.Diff negative x2
   - SBT trial -> patient looked good, but ABG showed PaO2 of 63, so kept
   intubated; will aim for net negative with CVVH and re-try tomorrow
   - Received 5 mg PO vitamin K
   - Concern by IR for ETT too high so got CXR; attending thought it
   looked OK so no intervention

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload. Currently weaning PEEP (at 5 on [**5-4**]). Goal of
   extubation in near future given patient now following commands (will
   attempt SBT today [**5-4**])
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP given in setting of femoral line bleed [**5-2**]
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis as below
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site [**5-2**] PM after HD line removed.
   - serial HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently off), leukocytosis, DIC concerning for
   sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory although
   stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and volume overload.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may experience further decline in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient's platelet count is low, and she is at risk for bleeding, particularly in the setting of active bleeding from the rectus sheath and groin site.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped significantly, and she may require transfusions to maintain a stable hemoglobin level.
4. Hypotension/possible infection: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she is at risk for further hypotension, particularly in the setting of sepsis.
5. Liver failure: The patient's liver function is compromised, and she is at risk for further deterioration, which may lead to multi-organ failure.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and she may require dialysis to manage her electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
7. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status is deteriorating, and she may experience further decline in cognitive function.
8. Possible UTI: The patient's urine culture is positive for yeast, and she may have a urinary tract infection.
9. Possible VAP: The patient's sputum culture is pending, and she may have a ventilator-associated pneumonia.
10. FEN: The patient is at risk for further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances, particularly in the setting of inadequate fluid management.

To address these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies. She should be treated with antibiotics for possible infections, and her fluid and electrolyte status should be carefully managed. Additionally, she should be considered for dialysis to manage her renal failure, and her mental status should be closely monitored to prevent further decline."

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 5). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands (will attempt SBT after new HD line placed)
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today after HD line
   in place
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP yesterday dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site yesterday PM after HD line
   removed.
   - serial HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - NGTD
   - urine culture
 grew yeast, treated with fluconazole
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.3 (stable)
   - check sputum culture
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn (day 1 - [**2147-4-29**]) for
   empiric 8 day course for possible VAP (will obtain sputum culture to
   guide antibiotics)
   - d/c PO vancomycin and IV flagyl as c.diff negative x2 and d/c c.diff
   precautions
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   - Currently off of levophed since [**2147-5-2**] (goal MAP > 65)
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone for presumed 28-day course
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - will discuss with renal plans for CVVH vs HD
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trended up to 17.8 today, now down to 14.
   C. Diff negative x2.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for HCAP but D/C PO vanc and IV flagyl for
   empiric coverage of C.difficile
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]
   - Patient no longer making urine; if UOP resumes, would recheck UA/UCx
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: R arm power PICC, A-line, HD catheter
   # Communication: Boyfriend [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11865**]
   # Code:  Full; no formal HCP - code status discussed with Brother [**Name (NI) **]
   and boyfriend [**Name (NI) **]; will readdress today
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
 will likely require
   family meeting to discuss clinical status/goals of care

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload and worsening mental status. Currently weaning PEEP
   (now at 5). Goal of extubation in near future given patient now
   following commands (will attempt SBT after new HD line placed)
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today after HD line
   in place
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP yesterday dosed at 0.3mcg/kg
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site yesterday PM after HD line
   removed.
   - serial HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently low dose), leukocytosis, DIC concerning
   for sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory
   although stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - NGTD
   - urine culture
 grew yeast, treated with fluconazole
   - trend lactate
 recent level 1.3 (stable)
   - check sputum culture
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn (day 1 - [**2147-4-29**]) for
   empiric 8 day course for possible VAP (will obtain sputum culture to
   guide antibiotics)
   - d/c PO vancomycin and IV flagyl as c.diff negative x2 and d/c c.diff
   precautions
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   - Currently off of levophed since [**2147-5-2**] (goal MAP > 65)
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone for presumed 28-day course
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]
   - will discuss with renal plans for CVVH vs HD
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, though
   differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active
   infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is likely given her history of
   alcoholism, acute liver failure and now encephalopathy. Initial
   discriminant function 137.  Per liver team, prognosis is poor given the
   trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these values appear ~stable or
   improving at this time. When Propofol is lightened, patient is able to
   follow commands, nod head to Qs.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - discontinued propofol [**4-27**] and will continue to monitor mental status
   (propofol is fat-soluble and thus has large volume of distribution; may
   take several days to excrete completely); currently back on propofol
   for comfort in setting of agitation at low dose
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC count trended up to 17.8 today, now down to 14.
   C. Diff negative x2.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ? urine) if febrile
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for HCAP but D/C PO vanc and IV flagyl for
   empiric coverage of C.difficile
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course started [**2055-4-24**]
   - Patient no longer making urine; if UOP resumes, would recheck UA/UCx
   .
   # FEN: Hold off on IVF in setting of volume overload, replete
   electrolytes, OG tube placed [**4-26**] for TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: R arm power PICC, A-line, HD catheter
   # Communication: Boyfriend [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11865**]

   Assessment and Plan
   44yo F w/hx of alcoholism who presents with acute liver failure and
   developed worsening renal failure and mental status changes consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy, s/p intubation and started on CVVH. Course
   complicated by DIC and rectus sheath bleed requiring multiple
   transfusions of pRBCs, cryo, plts, FFP.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure
 patient intubated and on mechanical
   ventilation due to hypoxia, worsening mental status.  Likely due to
   volume overload. Currently weaning PEEP (at 5 on [**5-4**]). Goal of
   extubation in near future given patient now following commands (will
   attempt SBT today [**5-4**])
   - Trend ABGs (A-line in place) [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily wake ups, wean PEEP as tolerated
   - Propofol sedation for patient comfort
   - Continue SBT, monitor RSBIs, consider extubation today
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/DIC
  low platelets with increased thrombin
   generation (decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated
   FDP).  Likely, DIC although difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy
   associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelets have been
   stable at > 50, fibrinogen trending down but > 100, INR now 2.2.
   Total transfusions since [**4-29**]: 12 units pRBCs, 4 units cryo, 5 units
   platelets, 9 units FFP. Received 1 unit of Rh positive platelets so
   treated with WhinRho as patient is Rh negative.
   - [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   - maintain platelet count >50K, fibrinogen >100
   - DDAVP given in setting of femoral line bleed [**5-2**]
   - Antibiotics for possible sepsis as below
   .
   #Anemia: Significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of
   coagulopathy on prednisone concerning for active bleeding vs
   hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding. Unknown whether this patient
   has esophageal or gastric varices. Patient with rectus sheath bleed on
   imaging. Had bleeding from groin site [**5-2**] PM after HD line removed.
   - serial HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - guaiac stools
   - consider NGT lavage
   .
   #Hypotension/possible infection:  Patient afebrile but with difficulty
   weaning off levophed (currently off), leukocytosis, DIC concerning for
   sepsis.  Potential sources of infection include respiratory although
   stable on ventilator, C. Diff associated disease, SBP.
   - blood cultures - NGTD
   - urine culture
 grew yeast, treated with fluconazole
   - trend lactate
 [**5-4**] level 1.3 (stable)
   - sputum culture
 unclear quality of specimen; no commensals; sparse
   yeast
 consider getting [**Last Name (un) 206**]/spec and restarting antifungals
   - CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast showed diffuse colonic bowel wall
   thickening concerning for infectious source (c.diff), large left rectus
   sheath fluid collection appears to be blood, small bilateral pleural
   effusions, diffuse fat stranding throughout mesentary.
   - [**5-3**] discontinued PO vancomycin and IV flagyl as c.diff negative x2
   and d/c c.diff precautions
   - broad spectrum antibiotics
 vancomycin, zosyn (day 1 - [**2147-4-29**]) for
   empiric 8 day course (to end [**5-7**]) for possible VAP (will attempt to
   obtain sputum culture to guide antibiotics)
   - hold atenolol
   - can transduce CVP by power PICC if needed
   - Currently off of levophed since [**2147-5-2**] (goal MAP > 65)
   .
   #. Liver Failure: Secondary to acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   - hepatitis serologies with no acute infection (HbsAb borderline, HBsAg
   neg; HAV IgG positive, HcAb Negative), [**Doctor First Name **] positive, anti-smooth muscle
   antibody positive. MELD score 45 based upon lab data from [**2147-4-24**] lab
   data.
   - monitor liver labs [**Hospital1 **]; FFP/DDAVP if actively bleeding
   - monitor DIC labs; platelets
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - midodrine, octreotide discontinued given HRS unlikely
   - Consider US-guided paracentesis
   - Continue prednisone for presumed 28-day course; day 1 = [**4-24**]
   - Continue TF with goal > [**2137**] calories/day (follow nutrition recs)
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN, less likely HRS.  Urine sodium is
   29.  Patient received IVF boluses and 1 unit of pRBCs with no
   improvement of renal failure.  Pt anuric at this time. [**Hospital3 **] confirms pt did NOT receive any recent dye/contrast. . Patient
   remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
   - Appreciate renal consult recommendations
   - Femoral HD catheter placed by renal service [**4-25**]; removed [**5-2**]; new
   temp HD line placed [**5-3**]
   - will discuss with renal plans for CVVH vs HD
   - recheck vancomycin level; dose for CrCl 30 on CRRT and follow levels
   closely per renal team
   .
   #. Mental Status Changes: Improving; when Propofol is lightened,
   patient is able to follow commands, nod head to Qs.. Likely due to
   hepatic encephalopathy, though differential also includes medication
   effect from ativan or active infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is
   likely given her history of alcoholism, acute liver failure and now
   encephalopathy. Initial discriminant function 137.  Per liver team,
   prognosis is poor given the trend in her LFTs and coags; however, these
   values appear ~stable or improving at this time.
   - continue rifaximin and lactulose
   - daily wake ups
   - propofol only as needed for comfort
   - treatment for liver failure/DIC as above
   - treatment for possible infection/sepsis as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis. WBC increased; C. Diff negative x2.
   - Pan-culture (sputum, blood, ?urine) if febrile
   - Trend CXR
   - Continue vanc and zosyn for HCAP as above but D/C PO vanc and IV
   flagyl for empiric coverage of C.difficile
   .
   #. ?UTI. Initial U/A with yeast but also with many epi
s, culture
   growing yeast. Repeat UA still with yeast, culture pending.
   - Treat UTI today for empiric course with renally-adjusted fluconazole
   (better urinary penetration than micafungin); Clcr
50 mL/minute (no
   dialysis): Administer 50% of recommended dose or administer every 48
   hours. Hemodialysis: 50% is removed by hemodialysis; administer 100% of
   daily dose (according to indication) after each dialysis treatment.
   Given possible hepatotoxicity, will treat with short 3 day course and
   discontinue if elevation in LFTs noted, then repeat UA to guide further
   treatment.  Repeat cxx also with yeast.
   - Fluconazole given for 5 day course [**2055-4-24**]
   - Patient no longer making urine; if UOP resumes, would recheck UA/UCx
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   liver
   - HD line placed by IR, renal rec re-start CVVH to remove volume
   - D/C PO vanc and IV flagyl as C.Diff negative x2
   - SBT trial -> patient looked good, but ABG showed PaO2 of 63, so kept
   intubated; will aim for net negative with CVVH and re-try tomorrow
   - Received 5 mg PO vitamin K
   - Concern by IR for ETT too high so got CXR; attending thought it
   looked OK so no intervention
   . Renal recs [**5-4**]

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presented with acute liver failure, worsening renal failure, and mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. She was intubated and started on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient's course has been complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), rectus sheath bleed, and anemia. She has also developed leukocytosis and a possible urinary tract infection (UTI).

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and volume overload. Weaning PEEP is ongoing, and the goal is to extubate the patient in the near future.
2. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient has low platelets with increased thrombin generation and fibrinolysis. DIC is likely, although it is difficult to distinguish from coagulopathy associated with severe liver disease on CVVH. Platelet transfusions have been stable at >50K, and fibrinogen levels are trending down but >100.
3. Anemia: The patient has a significant hematocrit drop from 24 to 14 in the setting of coagulopathy on prednisone, which is concerning for active bleeding vs hemolysis/DIC. No history of GI bleeding is present.
4. Hypotension/possible infection: The patient is afebrile but has difficulty weaning off levophed, leukocytosis, and DIC, which is concerning for sepsis. Potential sources of infection include respiratory, C. Diff associated disease, and SBP.
5. Liver Failure: The patient has secondary acute liver failure due to acute alcoholic hepatitis. MELD score is 45, and the patient is receiving lactulose, rifaximin, and prednisone.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has likely ATN, less likely HRS. Urine sodium is 29, and the patient remains anuric without signs of renal recovery.
7. Mental Status Changes: The patient has improving mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, although the differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active infection.
8. Leukocytosis: The patient has a WBC increased, and C. Diff is negative x2.
9. Possible UTI: The patient has a yeast culture growing from the urine, and treatment is pending.
10. FEN: The patient has volume overload, and IVF is being held off until repletion of electrolytes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to the presence of leukocytosis, DIC, and possible infection.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes are likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, although the differential also includes medication effect from ativan or active infection.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure if not addressed.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's DIC may lead to bleeding complications if not managed properly.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to the presence of leukocytosis, DIC, and possible UTI.

Recommendations:

1. Continue CVVH and monitor renal function.
2. Manage DIC with platelet transfusions and fibrinogen levels.
3. Address anemia with transfusions and consider NGT lavage.
4. Monitor and manage hypotension with vasopressors and fluids.
5. Continue treatment for liver failure with lactulose, rifaximin, and prednisone.
6. Monitor and manage mental status changes with daily wake-ups and propofol as needed.
7. Consider US-guided paracentesis for liver failure.
8. Treat possible UTI with fluconazole and monitor for signs of sepsis.
9. Monitor and manage respiratory failure with weaning PEEP and consideration of extubation.
10. Consider renal consult recommendations for CVVH vs HD."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, ETOH hepatitis, and renal failure. She is currently in the ICU and has been stable overnight. She has been receiving CVVH and has a dialysis catheter in place. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, and blood pressure of 91/81 mmHg. She is on a ventilator with a respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute and an FiO2 of 40%. Her oxygen saturation is 96%. Her physical examination is notable for jaundice, right lower extremity edema, and left lower extremity edema.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she does not respond to treatment or if there is a delay in intubation.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload may lead to worsening renal failure, electrolyte imbalances, and cardiac compromise.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's ETOH hepatitis and cirrhosis may lead to worsening renal failure and electrolyte imbalances.
4. VAP: The patient's VAP may lead to pneumonia and sepsis.
5. Sepsis: The patient's ETOH hepatitis and cirrhosis may lead to sepsis.
6. Cardiac compromise: The patient's fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances may lead to cardiac compromise.
7. GI bleeding: The patient's ETOH hepatitis and cirrhosis may lead to GI bleeding.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's ETOH hepatitis and cirrhosis may lead to neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, or encephalopathy.
9. Infection: The patient's ETOH hepatitis and cirrhosis may lead to infection.
10. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ETOH hepatitis and cirrhosis may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's altered mental status, bradycardia, respiratory failure, and hepatorenal syndrome require close monitoring and management. The patient's fluid overload and renal failure require continued fluid removal and close monitoring of electrolyte levels. The patient's ETOH hepatitis and cirrhosis require close monitoring of liver function and coagulation parameters. The patient's VAP requires treatment with antibiotics and close monitoring for signs of pneumonia and sepsis."
