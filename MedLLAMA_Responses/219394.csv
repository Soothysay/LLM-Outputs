   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo M with multiple CAD risk factors admitted for elective cardiac
   cath for symptoms of unstable angina. Transferred to CCU for
   peri-operative delerium.
   .
   # Delerium: Patient exhibited symptoms of delerium yesterday, including
   difficulty concentration, likely multifactorial, in the setting of
   medication effect (likely [**2-19**] benzodiazapines given peri-procedure),
   especially given stage IV chronic kidney disease and decreased
   medication clearance, age, in the setting of procedures, and lack of
   sleep. Neuro exam non-focal, so unlikely patient had thrombo-embolic
   event/CVA. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed (no evidence of
   hypotension or hematocrit drop). Change in mental status too acute to
   be infectious in nature.  Currently patient is sleeping, difficult to
   arouse but does wake up briefly before falling asleep again.
   - NPO for now
   - continue wrist restraints
   - IV zyprexa prn for agitation
   - hold all benzos, anticholinergics
   - no head imaging required at this time
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with multiple risk factors for CAD including HTN,
   HLD, and CKD. 2VD on cardiac cath yesterday, including 3 tight LAD
   lesions and LCx lesions. 2 tight LAD lesions were intervened on, but
   not the third LAD lesion and the LCx lesion.  CK significantly elevated
   this AM, 152 to 860.
   - continue low dose ASA, high dose statin, metoprolol, can d/c plavix
   after a few days
   - d/c integrilin given pt
s stage IV CKD
   - hold off on lisinopril today given acute on chronic renal failure
   - Consider optimize medical treatment by adding imdur if having
   persistent chest pain
   - continue IV cefazolin x3 doses post-cath
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: K was 5.2 on admission, 5.9 this AM.  Not getting
   medications that increase K. ACEI has been held.  Could be secondary to
   chronic kidney disease.  EKG showed no changes.  Patient was given
   insulin, D5, kayexalate PR this AM.
   - continue to trend, get pm lytes
   - monitor glucose with insulin on board in the setting of acute on
   chronic renal failure
   .
   # Chronic Kidney Disease: Stage IV CKD, w/ Cre clearance of 23.
   Received pre-cath hydration and IV mucomyst before and after
   catherization, but creatinine still bumped from 2.1 to 2.4, concerning
   for contrast-induced nephropathy complicating CKD.  Expect to see
   worsening renal function in the next 24-48h.
   - renally dose meds
   - get pm lytes
   - monitor for acidosis
   .
   # PUMP: Right heart catherization shows elevated LVEDP, PCWPs, and PA
   pressures.  TTE from [**6-26**] showed LVEF 50-55%, but nuclear stress test
   in [**7-26**] showed LV function slightly decreased with EF of 46% and
   global hypokinesis. Patient received NS and bicarb prior to cath, s/p
   20mg IV lasix in the cath lab post-cath with I/O overall negative by
   midnight per nursing.  CXR consistent with heart failure.
   - no lasix today as pt appears euvolemic, creatinine bumped, and AS
   patients are pre-load dependent
   - continue metoprolol
   - hold off on lisinopril today given acute on chronic renal failure
   - strict I/Os
   - daily weight
   .
   # Moderate AS: Patient with echo finding of aortic valve area of
   1.0cm2. Chest pain is likely from ACS, not from AS.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - hold lisinopril given acute on chronic renal failure
   - Since patient is currently asymptomatic from moderate AS, would hold
   off on Csurg consult
   - avoid nitroglycerin given pre-load dependence from AS
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient had sinus tachycardia on EKG on transfer to CCU,
   likely in setting of delerium, discomfort s/p procedures.  Patient was
   given metoprolol for tachycardia yesterday, he responded well to
   metoprolol.
   - continue metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor on tele
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus: hold all home hypoglycemics while in-house,
   especially in setting of recent contrast load.
   - RISS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 89-year-old male with multiple CAD risk factors admitted for elective cardiac catheterization for symptoms of unstable angina. He was transferred to the CCU for peri-operative delirium. The patient has stage IV chronic kidney disease, and his creatinine clearance is 23. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. His cardiac catheterization showed 2VD, including 3 tight LAD lesions and LCx lesions, with 2 tight LAD lesions intervened on. His lab results show elevated CK, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Contrast-induced nephropathy: The patient's creatinine clearance is 23, and he received pre-cath hydration and IV mucomyst before and after catheterization. This may have contributed to his worsening renal function.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level increased from 2.1 to 2.4, and he has a history of stage IV chronic kidney disease.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated, and he has a history of chronic kidney disease. This may be secondary to chronic kidney disease, and he was given insulin, D5, and kayexalate PR this morning.
4. Heart failure: The patient's CXR shows peri-hilar fullness and bibasilar atelectasis, which may indicate heart failure. His TTE shows LVEF 50-55%, and his nuclear stress test shows LV function slightly decreased with EF of 46% and global hypokinesis.
5. Aortic stenosis: The patient has moderate AS, which may be contributing to his symptoms of chest pain.
6. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which may be secondary to medication effects, decreased medication clearance, and lack of sleep.
7. Infection: The patient has a risk of developing an infection, especially with his history of chronic kidney disease and decreased immune function.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust medications accordingly.
2. Continue to trend the patient's potassium level and monitor for signs of hyperkalemia.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust medications accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust medications accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust medications accordingly.
6. Consider adding imdur if the patient has persistent chest pain.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's IV site and adjust as necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust as necessary.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust as necessary.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's heart rhythm and adjust as necessary."

   89 yo M with multiple CAD risk factors admitted for elective cardiac
   cath for symptoms of unstable angina. Transferred to CCU for
   peri-operative delerium.
   .
   # Delerium: Patient exhibits symptoms of delerium including difficulty
   concentration, likely in the setting of medication effect (likely [**2-19**]
   benzodiazapines given peri-procedure), especially given stage IV
   chronic kidney disease and decreased medication clearance. Neuro exam
   non-focal, so unlikely patient had thrombo-embolic event/CVA. No
   evidence of retroperitoneal bleed (no evidence of hypotension or
   hematocrit drop). Change in mental status too acute to be infectious in
   nature.
   - NPO for now
   - continue wrist restraints
   - IV zyprexa prn for agitation
   - hold all benzos, anticholinergics
   - tylenol standing for pain
   - no head imaging required at this time
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with multiple risk factors for CAD including HTN,
   HLD, and CKD. 2VD on cardiac cath yesterday, including 3 tight LAD
   lesions and LCx lesions. 2 tight LAD lesions were intervened on, but
   not the third LAD lesion and the LCx lesion.  CK significantly elevated
   this AM, 152 to 860.
   - continue full dose ASA, plavix, high dose statin, metoprolol
   - can restart lisinopril today
   - Consider take pt back to cath lab if having persistent chest pain, or
   optimize medical treatment by adding ACEI and imdur
   - continue IV cefazolin x3 doses post-cath
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: K was 5.2 on admission, 5.9 this AM.  Not getting
   medications that increase K. ACEI has been held.  Could be secondary to
   chronic kidney disease.  EKG showed no changes.  Patient was given
   insulin, D5, kayexalate this AM.
   - continue to trend
   .
   # PUMP: Right heart catherization shows elevated LVEDP, PCWPs, and PA
   pressures.  TTE from [**6-26**] showed LVEF 50-55%, but nuclear stress test
   in [**7-26**] showed LV function slightly decreased with EF of 46% and
   global hypokinesis. Patient received NS and bicarb prior to cath, s/p
   20mg IV lasix in the cath lab post-cath with I/O overall negative by
   midnight per nursing.
   - hold nitroglycerin given pre-load dependence from AS
   - continue metoprolol
   - restart lisinopril
   - strict I/Os, keep even today as AS patients are pre-load dependent
   - daily weight
   .
   # Moderate AS: Patient with echo finding of aortic valve area of
   1.0cm2. Chest pain is likely from ACS, not from AS.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old male admitted to the ICU for elective cardiac catheterization for symptoms of unstable angina. He was transferred to the CCU for peri-operative delirium. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have two tight lesions in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and one lesion in the left circumflex (LCx) artery, which were intervened on. The patient's creatinine kinase (CK) level is elevated, and his potassium level is slightly elevated.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Delirium: The patient's delirium is likely due to the effects of medications, particularly benzodiazepines, and his underlying chronic kidney disease. It is essential to continue monitoring his mental status and adjust medications as needed.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is slightly elevated, which may be due to his chronic kidney disease. It is crucial to continue monitoring his potassium levels and adjust medications as needed.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and underwent cardiac catheterization. He may be at risk for cardiac complications such as acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
4. Renal Complications: The patient has chronic kidney disease and may be at risk for worsening renal function, particularly with the use of certain medications.
5. Anemia: The patient's baseline hemoglobin level is 30%, which is slightly low. It is essential to continue monitoring his hemoglobin levels and adjust medications as needed.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient has diabetes mellitus and may be at risk for hyperglycemia, particularly with the use of certain medications.
7. Infection: The patient has a central line and may be at risk for central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
8. Thromboembolic Events: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and may be at risk for thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
9. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has moderate aortic stenosis, which may be a risk factor for cardiac complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust medications as needed to manage his delirium.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's potassium levels and adjust medications as needed to manage his hyperkalemia.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust medications as needed to manage his cardiac complications.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medications as needed to manage his chronic kidney disease.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's hemoglobin levels and adjust medications as needed to manage his anemia.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust medications as needed to manage his hyperglycemia.
7. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of infection and adjust antibiotics as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of thromboembolic events and adjust anticoagulation therapy as needed.
9. Consider consulting a cardiologist to further evaluate the patient's cardiac status and develop a plan for managing his moderate aortic stenosis."

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo M with multiple CAD risk factors admitted for elective cardiac
   cath for symptoms of unstable angina. Transferred to CCU for
   peri-operative delerium.
   .
   # Delerium: Patient exhibited symptoms of delerium yesterday, including
   difficulty concentration, likely in the setting of medication effect
   (likely [**2-19**] benzodiazapines given peri-procedure), especially given
   stage IV chronic kidney disease and decreased medication clearance.
   Neuro exam non-focal, so unlikely patient had thrombo-embolic
   event/CVA. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed (no evidence of
   hypotension or hematocrit drop). Change in mental status too acute to
   be infectious in nature.  Currently patient is sleeping, difficult to
   arouse but does wake up briefly before falling asleep again.
   - NPO for now
   - continue wrist restraints
   - IV zyprexa prn for agitation
   - hold all benzos, anticholinergics
   - tylenol standing for pain
   - no head imaging required at this time
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with multiple risk factors for CAD including HTN,
   HLD, and CKD. 2VD on cardiac cath yesterday, including 3 tight LAD
   lesions and LCx lesions. 2 tight LAD lesions were intervened on, but
   not the third LAD lesion and the LCx lesion.  CK significantly elevated
   this AM, 152 to 860.
   - continue full dose ASA, plavix, high dose statin, metoprolol
   - can restart lisinopril today
   - Consider take pt back to cath lab if having persistent chest pain, or
   optimize medical treatment by adding imdur
   - continue IV cefazolin x3 doses post-cath
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: K was 5.2 on admission, 5.9 this AM.  Not getting
   medications that increase K. ACEI has been held.  Could be secondary to
   chronic kidney disease.  EKG showed no changes.  Patient was given
   insulin, D5, kayexalate this AM.
   - continue to trend, get pm lytes
   .
   # Chronic Kidney Disease: Stage IV CKD, w/ Cre clearance of 23.
   Received pre-cath hydration and IV mucomyst before and after
   catherization, but creatinine still bumped from 2.1 to 2.4, concerning
   for contrast-induced nephropathy complicating CKD.
   - renally dose meds
   - get pm lytes
   .
   # PUMP: Right heart catherization shows elevated LVEDP, PCWPs, and PA
   pressures.  TTE from [**6-26**] showed LVEF 50-55%, but nuclear stress test
   in [**7-26**] showed LV function slightly decreased with EF of 46% and
   global hypokinesis. Patient received NS and bicarb prior to cath, s/p
   20mg IV lasix in the cath lab post-cath with I/O overall negative by
   midnight per nursing.  Appears euvolemic currently.
   - no lasix today as pt appears euvolemic, creatinine bumped, and AS
   patients are pre-load dependent
   - continue metoprolol
   - restart lisinopril
   - strict I/Os
   - daily weight
   .
   # Moderate AS: Patient with echo finding of aortic valve area of
   1.0cm2. Chest pain is likely from ACS, not from AS.
   - restart lisinopril today
   - Since patient is currently asymptomatic from moderate AS, would hold
   off on Csurg consult
   - avoid nitroglycerin given pre-load dependence from AS
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient had  sinus tachycardia on EKG on transfer to CCU,
   likely in setting of delerium, discomfort s/p procedures.  Patient was
   given metoprolol for tachycardia yesterday, he responded well to
   metoprolol.
   - continue metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor on tele
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus: hold all home hypoglycemics while in-house,
   especially in setting of recent contrast load.
   - RISS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, an 89-year-old male, was admitted to the ICU for elective cardiac catheterization due to symptoms of unstable angina. He has a history of chronic kidney disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed 2VD with 3 tight LAD lesions and LCx lesions. The patient received interventions for 2 LAD lesions but not the third LAD lesion and LCx lesion. His creatinine level increased from 2.1 to 2.4, and he developed hyperkalemia (K 5.9 mmol/L). The patient is currently experiencing delirium, likely related to medication effects and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Contrast-induced nephropathy: The patient's creatinine level increased significantly after cardiac catheterization, which may be related to contrast-induced nephropathy complicating chronic kidney disease.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated (5.9 mmol/L), which may be related to chronic kidney disease, medication, or other underlying conditions. Close monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level increased, and he has a history of chronic kidney disease, which may indicate acute kidney injury.
4. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which may be related to medication effects, chronic kidney disease, and other underlying conditions. Close monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent complications.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, and his cardiac catheterization revealed 2VD. Close monitoring for cardiac complications, such as acute coronary syndrome, is necessary.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient is receiving nasal cannula oxygen therapy, and his SpO2 is 91%. Close monitoring for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure, is necessary.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is receiving bowel regimen with colace and senna, and close monitoring for gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation or bowel obstruction, is necessary.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's delirium is likely related to medication effects and chronic kidney disease. The patient will be continued on IV zyprexa prn for agitation, and all benzodiazepines and anticholinergics will be held. The patient will be monitored closely for cardiac complications, and his creatinine level will be trended. The patient will be restarted on lisinopril and metoprolol, and his blood pressure will be closely monitored. The patient will also be monitored for hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury."

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo M with multiple CAD risk factors admitted for elective cardiac
   cath for symptoms of unstable angina. Transferred to CCU for
   peri-operative delerium.
   .
   # Delerium: Patient exhibited symptoms of delerium yesterday, including
   difficulty concentration, likely in the setting of medication effect
   (likely [**2-19**] benzodiazapines given peri-procedure), especially given
   stage IV chronic kidney disease and decreased medication clearance.
   Neuro exam non-focal, so unlikely patient had thrombo-embolic
   event/CVA. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed (no evidence of
   hypotension or hematocrit drop). Change in mental status too acute to
   be infectious in nature.  Currently patient is sleeping, difficult to
   arouse but does wake up briefly before falling asleep again.
   - NPO for now
   - continue wrist restraints
   - IV zyprexa prn for agitation
   - hold all benzos, anticholinergics
   - tylenol standing for pain
   - no head imaging required at this time
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with multiple risk factors for CAD including HTN,
   HLD, and CKD. 2VD on cardiac cath yesterday, including 3 tight LAD
   lesions and LCx lesions. 2 tight LAD lesions were intervened on, but
   not the third LAD lesion and the LCx lesion.  CK significantly elevated
   this AM, 152 to 860.
   - continue full dose ASA, plavix, high dose statin, metoprolol
   - hold off on lisinopril today given acute on chronic renal failure
   - Consider take pt back to cath lab if having persistent chest pain, or
   optimize medical treatment by adding imdur
   - continue IV cefazolin x3 doses post-cath
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: K was 5.2 on admission, 5.9 this AM.  Not getting
   medications that increase K. ACEI has been held.  Could be secondary to
   chronic kidney disease.  EKG showed no changes.  Patient was given
   insulin, D5, kayexalate this AM.
   - continue to trend, get pm lytes
   .
   # Chronic Kidney Disease: Stage IV CKD, w/ Cre clearance of 23.
   Received pre-cath hydration and IV mucomyst before and after
   catherization, but creatinine still bumped from 2.1 to 2.4, concerning
   for contrast-induced nephropathy complicating CKD.
   - renally dose meds
   - get pm lytes
   .
   # PUMP: Right heart catherization shows elevated LVEDP, PCWPs, and PA
   pressures.  TTE from [**6-26**] showed LVEF 50-55%, but nuclear stress test
   in [**7-26**] showed LV function slightly decreased with EF of 46% and
   global hypokinesis. Patient received NS and bicarb prior to cath, s/p
   20mg IV lasix in the cath lab post-cath with I/O overall negative by
   midnight per nursing.  Appears euvolemic currently.
   - no lasix today as pt appears euvolemic, creatinine bumped, and AS
   patients are pre-load dependent
   - continue metoprolol
   - hold off on lisinopril today given acute on chronic renal failure
   - strict I/Os
   - daily weight
   .
   # Moderate AS: Patient with echo finding of aortic valve area of
   1.0cm2. Chest pain is likely from ACS, not from AS.
   - restart lisinopril today
   - Since patient is currently asymptomatic from moderate AS, would hold
   off on Csurg consult
   - avoid nitroglycerin given pre-load dependence from AS
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient had  sinus tachycardia on EKG on transfer to CCU,
   likely in setting of delerium, discomfort s/p procedures.  Patient was
   given metoprolol for tachycardia yesterday, he responded well to
   metoprolol.
   - continue metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor on tele
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus: hold all home hypoglycemics while in-house,
   especially in setting of recent contrast load.
   - RISS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: will call out to [**Hospital1 1276**] once not delirious<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 89-year-old male with multiple CAD risk factors admitted for elective cardiac catheterization for symptoms of unstable angina. He was transferred to the CCU for peri-operative delirium.

The patient has been experiencing agitation, difficulty concentrating, and is currently sleeping with difficulty arousing. His neuro exam is non-focal, making it unlikely that he has had a thrombo-embolic event or CVA.

The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), stage IV, with decreased medication clearance. His creatinine levels have increased from 2.1 to 2.4, which may be due to contrast-induced nephropathy complicating CKD.

The patient's cardiac catheterization showed 2VD with 3 tight LAD lesions and LCx lesions. The 2 tight LAD lesions were intervened on, but not the third LAD lesion and the LCx lesion.

The patient has been experiencing hyperkalemia, with a potassium level of 5.2 on admission and 5.9 this morning. This may be secondary to chronic kidney disease.

The patient's lab results show elevated CK levels, with a value of 860. His EKG showed no changes.

The patient has a history of moderate aortic stenosis (AS), with an aortic valve area of 1.0 cm2. His chest pain is likely due to ACS, not AS.

The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia, likely due to delirium and discomfort post-procedure. He was given metoprolol for tachycardia, which responded well.

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus and anemia. His baseline Hct is 30, and his current Hct is at baseline.

The patient is currently receiving IV zyprexa prn for agitation, IV eptifibatide, and IV heparin sodium. He is also receiving oral medications such as metoprolol, plavix, high-dose statin, and ASA.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Contrast-induced nephropathy: The patient's creatinine levels have increased, which may be due to contrast-induced nephropathy complicating CKD.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated, which may be secondary to chronic kidney disease.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD, unstable angina, and moderate AS. He may be at risk for cardiac complications such as ACS, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
4. Delirium: The patient is experiencing agitation and difficulty concentrating, which may be due to delirium.
5. Infection: The patient has a central line and is at risk for central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs).
6. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy, which may increase his risk of bleeding.
7. Renal failure: The patient's CKD may progress to renal failure, which may require dialysis.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

He underwent cardiac catheterization yesterday, which revealed 2VD with 3 tight LAD lesions and LCx lesions. The 2 tight LAD lesions were intervened on, but not the third LAD lesion and the LCx lesion.

The patient is currently experiencing hyperkalemia, with a potassium level of 5.9 mmol/L. His eGFR is 23 mL/min, indicating stage IV CKD. He is also experiencing moderate aortic stenosis, with an aortic valve area of 1.0 cm².

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 121/58 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 91%, and he is receiving oxygen via nasal cannula.

The patient's neurological examination is non-focal, and he is agitated, but his neuro exam is non-focal. His cardiac examination is normal, with a regular rhythm and no murmurs, gallops, or thrills.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, with a peak value of 860 IU/L. His troponin level is normal. His complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 9.6 x 10⁹/L, a hemoglobin level of 11.1 g/dL, and a platelet count of 247 x 10⁹/L.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continuing full-dose ASA, Plavix, high-dose statin, and metoprolol
* Restarting lisinopril today
* Considering taking the patient back to the cath lab if he has persistent chest pain or optimizing medical treatment by adding ACEI and imdur
* Continuing IV cefazolin x3 doses post-cath
* Monitoring potassium levels and treating hyperkalemia with insulin, D5, and kayexalate
* Trending creatinine levels and adjusting medications accordingly
* Monitoring for signs of cardiac ischemia and adjusting treatment as necessary
* Restarting lisinopril today and considering taking the patient back to the cath lab if he has persistent chest pain or optimizing medical treatment by adding ACEI and imdur
* Continuing IV cefazolin x3 doses post-cath
* Monitoring potassium levels and treating hyperkalemia with insulin, D5, and kayexalate
* Trending creatinine levels and adjusting medications accordingly
* Monitoring for signs of cardiac ischemia and adjusting treatment as necessary

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac ischemia or infarction
* Hyperkalemia
* Chronic kidney disease progression
* Aortic stenosis progression
* Delirium
* Infection
* Bleeding complications from catheterization
* Contrast-induced nephropathy

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to be transferred to the hospital once he is not delirious."
