   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On the night of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - Contact IR
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with cordis and midline (will attempt IJ CVL)
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - NPO including meds
   - repeat Hct q4 (with transfusion goal >28) given active [**Doctor First Name 9056**]
   - given massive transfusion monitor coags and ionized calcium
   - holding BP meds.
   #. Hypotension: Pt has initially required intermittent pressor support
   with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of GI
   bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without WBC although
   immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has been
   afebrile.
   - LR boluses prn. Hold on pressors.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   - attempt IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])
   - CXR
   - check lactate
   - culture if spikes
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated emergently for airway
   protection.  Pt given aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and
   colloid. Pt EF >55%, although may become overloaded.  Patient looks
   comfortable on the ventilator, but since has had a recent hypotensive
   episode, will continue to keep patient on the ventilator.
   - will obtain ABG and adjust setting
   - stand vent care including mouthcare, HOB elevation and daily wakings
   - CXR
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely volume depletion in the setting of GI
   bleed. Cr 1.4 today. FeNa 0.04% previously.  However, given
   hypotension, the patient has likely developed ischemic ATN. In
   addition, developed a NAG metabolic acidosis, likely due to normal
   saline boluses.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - LR boluses PRN instead of normal saline
   - f/u renal recs
    # Afib: Currently in afib. No anticoagulation given GI bleed. Patient
   has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Unsure if active [**Month/Year (2) 9056**] or
   A fib.
   - Holding diltiazem and metoprolol given hypotension and GI bleed
   - If Hct stable, consider Metoprolol 5 mg IV for rate control.
   - cont to monitor on tele
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Being treated for a 14 day course (day 14
   today). ID is following.
   - will need to touch base with ID regarding course
   - cont meropenem
   .
   # Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment. Currently being treated for possible fungal infection.
   - clarify ID recs for indication for bronch
   - clarify ID reasoning for voriconazole given galactomannan and beta
   glucan markers for aspergillus negative.
   .
   #. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs. Need to clarify about restarting Etanercept and
   Tacrolimus. These drugs were D/Ced on arrival to unit.
   - cont Methylpred 40 mg IV Q12H, Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID,
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim
   - need to clarify whether voriconazole is treatment or ppx.
   .
   # HTN: Holding given hypotension.
   .
   # DM 2: Continue ISS and basal glargine
   .
   # Stage 4: sacral decubitus ulcer:

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On the night of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with refractory multiple myeloma, complicated by a duodenal ulcer, gastrointestinal bleed, and multiple organ dysfunction. He has undergone mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation and is currently receiving immunosuppressive therapy for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and is requiring mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's duodenal ulcer is actively bleeding, and there is a risk of further bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory failure.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, which could lead to further organ dysfunction and death if not managed promptly.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke if not managed effectively.
5. Sepsis: The patient has developed bacteremia and ESBL E. coli bacteruria, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction if not managed promptly.
6. Immunosuppression: The patient is immunosuppressed due to GVHD therapy, which increases the risk of infection and sepsis.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is at risk of nutritional deficiencies due to his gastrointestinal bleeding and inability to eat orally.
8. Wound complications: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, which could lead to further wound complications and infection if not managed effectively.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires ongoing monitoring and management of his gastrointestinal bleed, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and cardiac complications. He also requires treatment for his sepsis, immunosuppression, and nutritional deficiencies. The patient's wound care and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer are also important considerations."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On the night of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - Contact IR
   - maintain active T&C

   - repeat Hct q4 (with transfusion goal >28) given active [**Doctor First Name 9056**]
   - given massive transfusion monitor coags and ionized calcium
   - holding BP meds.
   #. Hypotension: Pt has initially required intermittent pressor support
   with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of GI
   bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without WBC although
   immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has been
   afebrile.

   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated emergently for airway
   protection.  Pt given aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and
   colloid. Pt EF >55%, although may become overloaded.  Patient looks
   comfortable on the ventilator, but since has had a recent hypotensive
   episode, will continue to keep patient on the ventilator.
   - will obtain ABG and adjust setting
   - stand vent care including mouthcare, HOB elevation and daily wakings
   - CXR
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely volume depletion in the setting of GI
   bleed. Cr 1.4 today. FeNa 0.04% previously.  However, given
   hypotension, the patient has likely developed ischemic ATN. In
   addition, developed a NAG metabolic acidosis, likely due to normal
   saline boluses.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - LR boluses PRN instead of normal saline

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma who has undergone mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and is currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for management of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, hypotension, and respiratory failure.

The patient's medical history is significant for refractory multiple myeloma, acute renal failure (ARF), and stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer. He has also had a prolonged hospital course, including episodes of parainfluenza pneumonia, ARDS, and bacteremia.

Current issues:

1. GI bleeding: The patient has had multiple episodes of GI bleeding, including a recent episode that required emergent endoscopy and clipping of a large duodenal ulcer. He remains at risk for further bleeding and has required intermittent pressor support to maintain blood pressure.
2. Hypotension: The patient has had recurrent episodes of hypotension, which have been managed with fluid resuscitation and pressor support. He is currently off pressors, but his blood pressure remains unstable.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated emergently for airway protection and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has a history of ARDS and has required aggressive resuscitation with crystalloid and colloid.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has ARF, which is likely secondary to hypovolemia and ischemic acute tubular necrosis. He has required intermittent dialysis and is being managed with fluids and electrolytes.
5. Escherichia coli bacteremia: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Escherichia coli, which is being treated with meropenem.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is being managed with anti-arrhythmic medications.
7. Nongap acidosis: The patient has a metabolic acidosis, which is likely secondary to his underlying condition and treatment with normal saline.

Potential medical complications:

1. Further GI bleeding: The patient remains at risk for further GI bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and multi-organ failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen, leading to hypoxia and multi-organ failure.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's ARF could worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease and the need for dialysis.
4. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia could worsen, leading to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation could worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust fluid management as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and adjust settings as needed.
3. Continue to manage the patient's ARF with fluids and electrolytes and consider dialysis as needed.
4. Continue to treat the patient's UTI with meropenem.
5. Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with anti-arrhythmic medications.
6. Consider further GI interventions, including endoscopy and clipping of the duodenal ulcer, and pursue IR embolization as an option.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamics and adjust treatment as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment as needed.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment as needed.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment as needed.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve his outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions.  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to
   inject and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of
   the bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  He received a total of 5U pRBC, 2 plts, and 5L IVF.
   - appreciate GI recs
   - IV PPI q12
   - NPO including meds
   - repeat Hct q4 (with transfusion goal >28) given active [**Month/Year (2) 9056**]
   - Type and Cross 4U
   - Maintain access with cordis and midline (will attempt IJ CVL)
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support
   - attempt IJ for CVP measurement (goal [**6-26**])
   - holding BP meds
   - place foley for UOP monitoring (>30cc/hr)
   - given massive transfusion monitor coags and ionized calcium
   .
   #. Hypotension: Pt has required intermittent pressor support with neo
   and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of GI bleed.
   Also sedation following intubation. Pt without WBC although
   immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has been
   afebrile.
   - IVF prn
   - Maintain MAPS >65 with pressor support (wean as tolerated)
   - attempt IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])
   - CXR
   - check lactate
   - culture if spikes
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated emergently for airway
   protection.  Pt given aggressive resucitation with crystalloid and
   colloid. Pt EF >55%, although may become overloaded. Current setting
   are Vt:55, RR:16 PEEP:5 FiO2 50%.
   - will obtain ABG and adjust setting
   - stand vent care including mouthcare, HOB elevation and daily wakings
   - CXR

   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely volume depletion in the setting of GI
   bleed. Cr 1.4 today. FeNa 0.04% previously.  However, given hypotension
   and pressor requirement patient likely to develop ATN.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds

   #. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - cont immunosuppressants (changed to IV)
   - cont Methylpred 40 mg IV Q12H, Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID, Etanercept.
   - will need to discuss with BMT regarding IV dosing for Tacrolimus
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir Bactrim
   - need to clarify whether voriconazole is treatment or ppx.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma, who has undergone mini-allogeneic SCT and is currently admitted to the MICU for GI bleed. The patient's condition is complex, with multiple medical complications.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* T-max: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* T-current: 35.9°C (96.6°F)
* HR: 114 bpm
* BP: 105/70 mmHg
* RR: 16 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 100%

The patient has a history of:

* GI bleed, which was treated with endoscopy and endoclips
* Hypotension, which is likely secondary to hypovolemia and sedation following intubation
* Respiratory failure, which is being managed with mechanical ventilation
* Acute renal failure, which is likely volume depletion-related
* ESBL E. coli bacteruria, which is being treated with a 14-day course of meropenem
* Refractory multiple myeloma, which is being treated with immunosuppressive therapy
* Afib, which is currently being monitored on telemetry

The patient's laboratory results are:

* WBC: 15.3
* Hct: 29.1
* Plt: 94
* Cr: 1.4
* Glucose: 73

The patient's plan of care includes:

* GI bleed: to maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support, and attempt IJ CVL for CVP measurement
* Hypotension: to maintain MAPS >65 with pressor support, and attempt IJ CVL for CVP measurement
* Respiratory failure: to obtain ABG and adjust settings, stand vent care, and CXR
* Acute renal failure: to monitor Cr, avoid nephrotoxins, and renally dose meds
* ESBL E. coli bacteruria: to continue meropenem and touch base with ID regarding course
* Refractory multiple myeloma: to continue immunosuppressive therapy, including IV dosing for Tacrolimus
* Afib: to hold diltiazem and metoprolol, and continue to monitor on telemetry

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: due to the patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of bacteruria
* Acute kidney injury: due to the patient's history of acute renal failure and potential for ATN
* Respiratory failure: due to the patient's underlying lung disease and potential for further respiratory decompensation
* GI bleed: due to the patient's history of GI bleed and potential for further bleeding
* Hypotension: due to the patient's underlying hypovolemia and potential for further hypotension

The patient's overall condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications and improve his chances of recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 61-year-old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma, has been admitted to the MICU for a gastrointestinal bleed. He has a complex medical history, including mini-allogeneic SCT, Parainfluenza pneumonia with ARDS, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia, right basilic vein thrombus, and suspected PE. He has required multiple interventions, including emergent EGD, pressor support, and blood transfusions.

Current conditions:

* The patient is intubated and sedated, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8/15.
* He has atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and requires intermittent pressor support due to hypotension.
* He has a duodenal ulcer with large clots, which was treated with endoscopy and cauterization.
* He has impaired skin integrity, with a sacral decubitus ulcer.
* He has a gastrointestinal bleed, with a hemodynamic instability requiring emergent fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions.
* He has acute renal failure (ARF), with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL.
* He has ESBL E. coli bacteruria, which is being treated with a 14-day course of antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Further bleeding from the duodenal ulcer
* Development of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension and pressor requirement
* Progression of ARF, potentially leading to end-stage renal disease
* Worsening of immunosuppression, increasing the risk of opportunistic infections
* Development of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CR-BSIs)
* Increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to central venous catheters
* Potential for worsening of sacral decubitus ulcer and other skin integrity issues
* Increased risk of nosocomial infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs)

Recommendations for further management:

* Continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status.
* Adjust pressor support and fluid management to optimize hemodynamic stability.
* Continue treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteruria and monitor for signs of treatment failure.
* Consider consultation with the infectious disease service to optimize antibiotic therapy.
* Monitor for signs of worsening ARF and adjust management accordingly.
* Continue to manage the patient's immunosuppression and consider consultation with the transplant service to optimize therapy.
* Monitor for signs of worsening sacral decubitus ulcer and other skin integrity issues, and consider consultation with wound care specialists.
* Continue to monitor for signs of nosocomial infections and take steps to prevent VAP, CAUTIs, and other infections."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma who has been admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has undergone multiple procedures, including endoscopy, and has been treated with various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and immunosuppressants.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate is 114 beats per minute, and blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg. Respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100%.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient is in atrial fibrillation, and his cardiac rhythm is irregular. He has a history of hypertension, and his blood pressure is being monitored closely.
* Renal function: The patient's creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 20 mg/dL. He has a history of acute renal failure (ARF) and is at risk for developing acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has a duodenal ulcer with large clots and has undergone endoscopy with injection and endoclipping. He has also received proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and has been NPO.
* Infectious disease: The patient has a history of ESBL E. coli bacteruria and is being treated with meropenem.
* Immunosuppression: The patient has undergone mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and is receiving immunosuppressants, including tacrolimus, methylprednisolone, and etanercept.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued bleeding from the duodenal ulcer
* Development of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypovolemia and nephrotoxins
* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections due to the patient's immunosuppressed state
* Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's bacteremia and other infections
* Gastrointestinal perforation or abscess formation due to the patient's duodenal ulcer and immunosuppressed state
* Renal failure or acute kidney injury due to the patient's history of ARF and continued use of nephrotoxins
* Cardiovascular complications, such as atrial fibrillation, hypertension, or hypotension, due to the patient's underlying medical conditions and medications.

The patient's care plan includes:

* Continuation of invasive ventilation with close monitoring of respiratory status
* Close monitoring of cardiovascular status, including blood pressure and heart rate
* Management of gastrointestinal bleeding with proton pump inhibitors and continued monitoring of stool output
* Continued treatment of ESBL E. coli bacteruria with meropenem
* Close monitoring of renal function, including creatinine and BUN levels, and management of ARF or ATN if it develops
* Immunosuppressive therapy with tacrolimus, methylprednisolone, and etanercept to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
* Wound care and management of sacral decubitus ulcer
* Glycemic control with insulin and basal glargine
* Nutrition support with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and enteral nutrition as tolerated."

   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.

   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions.  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to
   inject and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of
   the bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  He received a total of 5U pRBC, 2 plts, and 5L IVF.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Disposition: ICU level of care<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma who was admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleed, upper (melena, GI bleed, GIB). The patient has a complex medical history, including mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), Parainfluenza pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and bacteremia treated with meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: The patient is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and is receiving intermittent pressor support with norepinephrine and levothyroxine due to hypovolemia and sedation.
* Renal function: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL and a fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) of 0.04%.
* Hematological status: The patient has a hemoglobin level of 12.2 g/dL and a platelet count of 94,000 cells per microliter.
* Infectious status: The patient has ESBL E. coli bacteruria, which is being treated with meropenem for a 14-day course.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to the presence of ARDS, which can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension may worsen due to continued bleeding, sepsis, or cardiac dysfunction, which can lead to cardiovascular collapse and cardiac arrest.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's ARF may progress to acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not managed promptly and effectively.
4. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of bacteruria increase the risk of secondary infections, such as pneumonia, sepsis, or urinary tract infections.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's GI bleed may recur or worsen, leading to further blood loss, hypovolemia, and cardiovascular instability.
6. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and bacteruria may lead to sepsis, which can worsen the patient's cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal function.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, I recommend the following:

1. Continue respiratory support with invasive ventilation and monitor for signs of respiratory failure.
2. Maintain cardiovascular stability with pressor support and monitor for signs of cardiovascular instability.
3. Manage ARF with fluid resuscitation, diuretics, and renal replacement therapy if necessary.
4. Monitor for signs of infection and treat promptly if detected.
5. Continue to manage the patient's GI bleed with fluid resuscitation, transfusions, and endoscopic intervention if necessary.
6. Consider transferring the patient to a higher level of care, such as a cardiothoracic intensive care unit (ICU) or a nephrology ICU, if necessary."

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   .
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**].
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - Contact IR
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with cordis and midline (will attempt IJ CVL)
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - NPO including meds
   - repeat Hct q4 (with transfusion goal >28) given active bleeding
   - given massive transfusion monitor coags and ionized calcium
   - holding BP meds.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Pt has initially required intermittent pressor support
   with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of GI
   bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without WBC although
   immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has been
   afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - LR boluses prn. Hold on pressors.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   - attempt IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])
   - CXR
   - check lactate
   - culture if spikes
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated emergently for airway
   protection.  Pt given aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and
   colloid. Pt EF >55%, although may become overloaded.  Patient looks
   comfortable on the ventilator, but since has had a recent hypotensive
   episode, will continue to keep patient on the ventilator.
   - will obtain ABG and adjust setting
   - stand vent care including mouthcare, HOB elevation and daily wakings
   - CXR
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely volume depletion in the setting of GI
   bleed. Cr 1.4 today. FeNa 0.04% previously.  However, given
   hypotension, the patient has likely developed ischemic ATN. In
   addition, developed a NAG metabolic acidosis, likely due to normal
   saline boluses.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - LR boluses PRN instead of normal saline
   - f/u renal recs
    # Afib: Currently in afib. No anticoagulation given GI bleed. Patient
   has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Unsure if active bleeding or
   A fib.
   - Holding diltiazem and metoprolol given hypotension and GI bleed
   - If Hct stable, consider Metoprolol 5 mg IV for rate control.
   - cont to monitor on tele
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Being treated for a 14 day course (day 14
   today). ID is following.
   - will need to touch base with ID regarding course
   - cont meropenem
   .
   # Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment. Currently being treated for possible fungal infection.
   - clarify ID recs for indication for bronch
   - clarify ID reasoning for voriconazole given galactomannan and beta
   glucan markers for aspergillus negative.
   .
   #. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs. Need to clarify about restarting Etanercept and
   Tacrolimus. These drugs were D/Ced on arrival to unit.
   - cont Methylpred 40 mg IV Q12H, Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID,
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim
   - need to clarify whether voriconazole is treatment or ppx.
   .
   # HTN: Holding given hypotension.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with refractory multiple myeloma, status post mini-allogeneic stem cell transplant, and a complicated hospital course. He has developed acute respiratory failure, requiring intubation, and is currently on pressure support ventilation. He has also experienced a gastrointestinal bleed, requiring transfusions and endoscopic treatment. He has developed acute kidney injury, likely due to hypovolemia and ischemic ATN, and is being treated for possible fungal infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is precarious, and he may require continued ventilatory support. He is at risk for further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory failure.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has already experienced a significant gastrointestinal bleed, and there is a risk of further bleeding, especially with the clips falling out of the duodenal ulcer.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's kidney function is impaired, and he is at risk for further kidney damage, potentially requiring renal replacement therapy.
4. Infection: The patient is immunosuppressed, and there is a risk of developing infections, such as sepsis, pneumonia, and bacteremia.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be indicative of underlying cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, or cardiac tamponade.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's immunosuppressed state and ongoing bleeding may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, encephalopathy, or cerebral edema.
7. Wound Complications: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, which may become infected or develop further complications, such as osteomyelitis or sepsis.
8. Fungal Infection: The patient is being treated for possible fungal infection, and there is a risk of developing further fungal complications, such as aspergillosis or candidemia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, and adjust ventilator settings as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's gastrointestinal bleed, and consider further interventions, such as endoscopic treatment or IR embolization.
3. Monitor the patient's kidney function closely, and consider renal replacement therapy if necessary.
4. Continue to treat the patient's infections, and monitor for signs of sepsis or organ failure.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely, and consider further interventions, such as cardiac catheterization or cardiac surgery, if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely, and consider further interventions, such as anticonvulsant therapy or neurointensive care, if necessary.
7. Continue to manage the patient's wound, and consider further interventions, such as wound debridement or wound vacuum-assisted closure, if necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's fungal infection, and consider further interventions, such as antifungal therapy or surgical debridement, if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   .
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**].
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - Contact IR
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with cordis and midline (will attempt IJ CVL)
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - NPO including meds
   - repeat Hct q4 (with transfusion goal >28) given active bleeding
   - given massive transfusion monitor coags and ionized calcium
   - holding BP meds.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Pt has initially required intermittent pressor support
   with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of GI
   bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without WBC although
   immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has been
   afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - LR boluses prn. Hold on pressors.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   - attempt IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])
   - CXR
   - check lactate
   - culture if spikes
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated emergently for airway
   protection.  Pt given aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and
   colloid. Pt EF >55%, although may become overloaded.  Patient looks
   comfortable on the ventilator, but since has had a recent hypotensive
   episode, will continue to keep patient on the ventilator.
   - will obtain ABG and adjust setting
   - stand vent care including mouthcare, HOB elevation and daily wakings
   - CXR
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Likely volume depletion in the setting of GI
   bleed. Cr 1.4 today. FeNa 0.04% previously.  However, given
   hypotension, the patient has likely developed ischemic ATN. In
   addition, developed a NAG metabolic acidosis, likely due to normal
   saline boluses.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - LR boluses PRN instead of normal saline
   - f/u renal recs
    # Afib: Currently in afib. No anticoagulation given GI bleed. Patient
   has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Unsure if active bleeding or
   A fib.
   - Holding diltiazem and metoprolol given hypotension and GI bleed
   - If Hct stable, consider Metoprolol 5 mg IV for rate control.
   - cont to monitor on tele
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Being treated for a 14 day course (day 14
   today). ID is following.
   - will need to touch base with ID regarding course

   # Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment. Currently being treated for possible fungal infection.
   - clarify ID recs for indication for bronch
   - clarify ID reasoning for voriconazole given galactomannan and beta
   glucan markers for aspergillus negative.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma who has been admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleed, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure. He has undergone mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation and has a complicated medical history, including parainfluenza pneumonia, ARDS, and bacteremia. He has required multiple blood transfusions and has been treated with various antibiotics and antifungals.

Current Status:

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute and a SpO2 of 99%. He has a heart rate of 121 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 139/83 mmHg. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 10 mmHg and a pulmonary artery pressure of 20 mmHg. His fluid balance shows a positive balance of 3,253 mL, and his urine output has been poor, requiring a 500cc bolus.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient's ongoing bleeding from the duodenal ulcer is a significant concern, and he may require further intervention, including IR embolization.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to his underlying lung disease and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, and he has a history of volume depletion and hypotension, which may worsen his renal function.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to further complications, including thromboembolic events and heart failure.
5. Immunosuppression: The patient's immunosuppressed state may increase his risk of infection, including fungal and bacterial infections.
6. Worsening Opacities on CT: The patient's worsening opacities on CT scan may indicate a worsening fungal infection, which requires further evaluation and treatment.
7. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen due to his ongoing bleeding, hypovolemia, and possible sepsis.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status is unknown due to his intubation, and he may be at risk for neurological complications, including seizures and cerebral edema.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and adjust his fluid and blood transfusion needs accordingly.
2. Maintain his respiratory support with mechanical ventilation and adjust his settings as needed.
3. Continue to monitor his renal function and adjust his medications and fluids accordingly.
4. Continue to treat his atrial fibrillation and monitor his heart rate and rhythm.
5. Continue to monitor his immunosuppressed state and adjust his antibiotics and antifungals as needed.
6. Consider further evaluation and treatment for his worsening opacities on CT scan.
7. Continue to monitor his neurological status and adjust his sedation and analgesia as needed.
8. Consider further intervention, including IR embolization, for his ongoing gastrointestinal bleed."

   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**].
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - Contact IR
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with cordis and midline (will attempt IJ CVL)
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - NPO including meds (pt normally NPO [**12-17**] GVHD)
   - repeat Hct q8 (with transfusion goal >28) today given pt has been
   stable
   - given massive transfusion monitor coags and ionized calcium
   - holding BP meds
   - f/u H pylori
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated emergently for airway
   protection.  Pt given aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and
   colloid. Pt EF >55%, although may become overloaded.  Patient looks
   comfortable on the ventilator, but since has had a recent hypotensive
   episode, will continue to keep patient on the ventilator. Doing well on
   minimal PS settings, RISBI 47.
   - SBT today, follow w/ ABG
   - check cuff leak, cough, then extubate if ok
   - stand vent care including mouthcare, HOB elevation and daily wakings
   .
   #. Oliguria: Low UOP in setting of baseline Cr of 1.5, may be volume
   depletion although has had aggressive fluid resuscitation. FeNa 0.04%
   previously.  However, given hypotension, the patient has likely
   developed ischemic ATN. In addition, developed a NAG metabolic
   acidosis, likely due to normal saline boluses.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - check CVP after extubation
   .
    # Afib: Currently in afib. No anticoagulation given GI bleed. Patient
   has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Unsure if active bleeding or
   A fib.
   - Holding home diltiazem and metoprolol given hypotension and GI bleed
   - cont to monitor on tele
   - increase to metoprolol IV 5 q4h
   .
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Being treated for a 14 day course (day 14
   today). ID is following.
   - per ID: can d/c meropenam today
   .
   # Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment. Currently being treated for possible fungal infection.
   - ID: bronch not necessary unless ICU team wants // vori can be changed
   to ppx dose if BMT ok since galactomannan and beta glucan markers for
   aspergillus negative.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Pt has initially required intermittent pressor support
   with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of GI
   bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without WBC although
   immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has been
   afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   - attempt IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])
   .
   #. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs. Need to clarify about restarting Etanercept and
   Tacrolimus. These drugs were D/Ced on arrival to unit.
   - cont Methylpred 40 mg IV Q12H, Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID,
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim
   - need to clarify whether voriconazole is treatment or ppx.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old gentleman with refractory multiple myeloma who has undergone mini-allogeneic SCT and has developed various complications, including:

1. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient is currently in AFIB, which is being managed with medication.
2. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has had a profuse bright red blood per rectum, which was treated with emergent fluid resuscitation and PRBC transfusions. He underwent EGD and was found to have a large healing ulcer in the duodenum, which was treated with endoclipping. However, the clips fell out, and the patient continued to bleed. Surgery and GI recommended possible IR embolization.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated emergently for airway protection and is currently on minimal PS settings. He is doing well on the ventilator, but may require continued support.
4. Oliguria: The patient has low UOP in the setting of baseline Cr of 1.5, which may be due to volume depletion or ischemic ATN. He is being closely monitored for Cr and is receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation.
5. ESBL E. coli bacteruria: The patient is being treated for a 14-day course of meropenem.
6. Worsening opacities on CT: The patient is being treated for possible fungal infection with voriconazole.
7. Hypotension: The patient has required intermittent pressor support with neo and levo, which may be due to hypovolemia or sedation.
8. Refractory multiple myeloma: The patient's course has been complicated, and he is now at risk for GVHD.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Bleeding: The patient's GI bleed may continue to worsen, and he may require further intervention, such as IR embolization.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient may require continued ventilatory support, and there is a risk of respiratory failure.
3. Oliguria: The patient's low UOP may worsen, and he may develop acute kidney injury (AKI).
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his immunosuppressed state and the presence of ESBL E. coli bacteruria.
5. GVHD: The patient is at risk for GVHD, which can have severe consequences.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen, and he may require further pressor support.
7. Fungal infection: The patient's worsening opacities on CT may indicate a worsening fungal infection, which can be life-threatening.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's AFIB may worsen, and he may develop cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current status, it is essential to closely monitor his condition and manage his complications aggressively to prevent further deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation, multiple myeloma, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is currently receiving invasive ventilation.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's vital signs have remained stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 131 bpm, and blood pressure of 128/80 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status has improved, with a reduction in respiratory rate and an increase in oxygen saturation.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.3 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 12.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 78 K/uL. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, with an ALT level of 31 U/L and AST level of 44 U/L. The patient's renal function is also impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL.

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals, as well as medications to manage his atrial fibrillation and hypertension. The patient is also receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has a midline and multi-lumen central venous catheter in place.

Potential medical complications that may arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes may indicate the presence of an underlying infection.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and current bleeding symptoms may lead to further bleeding complications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate further, leading to respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and potential cardiac arrest.
5. Renal failure: The patient's impaired renal function may worsen, leading to renal failure.
6. Infection: The patient's impaired immune system may increase the risk of infection.
7. Bleeding complications: The patient's impaired coagulation function may lead to bleeding complications.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust his medications and treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   # Afib: Currently in afib with tachycardia. No anticoagulation given GI
   bleed. Patient has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Since the
   patient had a GI bleed, all of his PO nodal agents were D/C
ed. IV
   Lopressor and diltiazem were given to control the rate before switching
   over to a PO regimen.
   - Started Metoprolol 50 TID (transferred on 100 mg TID). Will hold dilt
   90 mg QID.
   - cont to monitor on tele
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**]. Had melanotic stools
   recently, however, crits stable.
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with right IJ and midline
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - NPO including meds (pt normally NPO [**12-17**] GVHD)
   - repeat Hct q12 (with transfusion goal >28) today given pt has been
   stable
   - f/u H pylori
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient initially presented with
   oliguria in setting of baseline Cr of 1.5 (feNa=0.04%), which was
   likely due to volume depletion from GI blood loss. However, given
   prolonged hypotension, the patient has likely developed ischemic ATN.
   In addition, developed a NAG metabolic acidosis, likely due to normal
   saline boluses.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - check CVP to assess if volume depleted
   .
   # Hyponatremia: The patient developed hyponatremia (Na=132) and it
   complicated to tell if the volume status of the patient (hypovolemic
   vs. euvolemic vs. hypervolemic). Cr increased from 1.5
1.6.
   - check urine lytes
   - check PM lytes to see if hyponatremia worsened
   .#. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - Tacrolimus re-started on [**6-10**]. Need to follow-up Tacrolimus level.
   - Check daily tacrolimus levels, as per onc.
   - Check daily LFTs, as per onc.
   - Continue to hold Etanercept, as per onc.
   - cont Methylpred 40 mg IV Q12H, Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID. Will not
   taper methyl pred levels until review tacrolimus levels.
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim, voriconazole
   # HTN: Started on metoprolol PO. Still holding home dilt.
   # Stage 4: sacral decubitus ulcer:
   - Continue wound care
   # Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment.
   - ID: bronch not necessary unless ICU team wants // vori can be changed
   to ppx dose if BMT ok since galactomannan and beta glucan markers for
   aspergillus negative.
   - Will hold on bronch now.
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Finished 14/14 day course of meropenem. ID is
   following.
   - f/u ID note.
   #. Respiratory Failure--resolved: Pt currently breathing on 3L NC.
   Initially, pt was intubated emergently for airway protection.  Pt given
   aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and colloid. Pt EF >55%,
   although may become overloaded.
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   #. Hypotension: Issue resolved. Pt has initially required intermittent
   pressor support with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in
   the setting of GI bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without
   WBC although immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has
   been afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   -  IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])
   # DM 2: Continue ISS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   # Afib: Currently in afib with tachycardia. No anticoagulation given GI
   bleed. Patient has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Since the
   patient had a GI bleed, all of his PO nodal agents were D/C
ed. IV
   Lopressor and diltiazem were given to control the rate before switching
   over to a PO regimen.
   - Started Metoprolol 50 TID (transferred on 100 mg TID). Will hold dilt
   90 mg QID.

   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**]. Had melanotic stools
   recently, however, crits stable.
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with right IJ and midline
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal

   - repeat Hct q12 (with transfusion goal >28) today given pt has been
   stable
   - f/u H pylori
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient initially presented with
   oliguria in setting of baseline Cr of 1.5 (feNa=0.04%), which was
   likely due to volume depletion from GI blood loss. However, given
   prolonged hypotension, the patient has likely developed ischemic ATN.
   In addition, developed a NAG metabolic acidosis, likely due to normal
   saline boluses.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - check CVP to assess if volume depleted
   .
   # Hyponatremia: The patient developed hyponatremia (Na=132) and it
   complicated to tell if the volume status of the patient (hypovolemic
   vs. euvolemic vs. hypervolemic). Cr increased from 1.5
1.6.
   - check urine lytes
   - check PM lytes to see if hyponatremia worsened
   .#. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - Tacrolimus re-started on [**6-10**]. Need to follow-up Tacrolimus level.
   - Check daily tacrolimus levels, as per onc.
   - Check daily LFTs, as per onc.
   - Continue to hold Etanercept, as per onc.
   - cont Methylpred 40 mg IV Q12H, Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID. Will not
   taper methyl pred levels until review tacrolimus levels.
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim, voriconazole
   # HTN: Started on metoprolol PO. Still holding home dilt.

   - Will hold on bronch now.
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Finished 14/14 day course of meropenem. ID is
   following.
   - f/u ID note.
   #. Respiratory Failure--resolved: Pt currently breathing on 3L NC.
   Initially, pt was intubated emergently for airway protection.  Pt given
   aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and colloid. Pt EF >55%,
   although may become overloaded.
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   #. Hypotension: Issue resolved. Pt has initially required intermittent
   pressor support with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in
   the setting of GI bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without
   WBC although immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to various complications. Currently, he is intubated and on invasive ventilation, with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and impaired skin integrity. He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, including a recent episode of melena, and has required multiple blood transfusions. He also has acute on chronic renal failure, hyponatremia, and is at risk for sepsis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is tenuous, and he may require continued mechanical ventilation to support his breathing.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to further cardiac complications, such as stroke or cardiac arrest.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's recent episode of melena may recur, leading to further bleeding and potential complications.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may worsen, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances or uremic syndrome.
5. Sepsis: The patient's immunosuppressed state and recent infections may increase his risk of developing sepsis.
6. Wound complications: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer may become infected or worsen, leading to further complications.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may worsen, leading to further complications such as seizures or coma.
8. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may recur, leading to further complications such as organ dysfunction or failure.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. The plan is to continue invasive ventilation, monitor his cardiac status, and manage his gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's renal function will be closely monitored, and he will receive further treatment for his hyponatremia. The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer will be closely monitored for signs of infection or worsening. The patient's code status is full code, and he will be discharged from the ICU once his rate control is improved."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**].
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - Contact IR
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with cordis and midline (will attempt IJ CVL)
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - NPO including meds (pt normally NPO [**12-17**] GVHD)
   - repeat Hct q8 (with transfusion goal >28) today given pt has been
   stable
   - given massive transfusion monitor coags and ionized calcium
   - holding BP meds
   - f/u H pylori
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated emergently for airway
   protection.  Pt given aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and
   colloid. Pt EF >55%, although may become overloaded.  Patient looks
   comfortable on the ventilator, but since has had a recent hypotensive
   episode, will continue to keep patient on the ventilator. Doing well on
   minimal PS settings, RISBI 47.
   - SBT today, follow w/ ABG
   - check cuff leak, cough, then extubate if ok
   - stand vent care including mouthcare, HOB elevation and daily wakings
   .
   #. Oliguria: Low UOP in setting of baseline Cr of 1.5, may be volume
   depletion although has had aggressive fluid resuscitation. FeNa 0.04%
   previously.  However, given hypotension, the patient has likely
   developed ischemic ATN. In addition, developed a NAG metabolic
   acidosis, likely due to normal saline boluses.
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - check CVP after extubation
   .
    # Afib: Currently in afib. No anticoagulation given GI bleed. Patient
   has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Unsure if active bleeding or
   A fib.
   - Holding home diltiazem and metoprolol given hypotension and GI bleed
   - cont to monitor on tele
   - increase to metoprolol IV 5 q4h
   .
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Being treated for a 14 day course (day 14
   today). ID is following.
   - per ID: can d/c meropenam today
   .
   # Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment. Currently being treated for possible fungal infection.
   - ID: bronch not necessary unless ICU team wants // vori can be changed
   to ppx dose if BMT ok since galactomannan and beta glucan markers for
   aspergillus negative.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Pt has initially required intermittent pressor support
   with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of GI
   bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without WBC although
   immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has been
   afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   - attempt IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])
   .
   #. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs. Need to clarify about restarting Etanercept and
   Tacrolimus. These drugs were D/Ced on arrival to unit.
   - cont Methylpred 40 mg IV Q12H, Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID,
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim
   - need to clarify whether voriconazole is treatment or ppx.
   .
   # HTN: Holding given hypotension.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma who underwent mini-allogeneic SCT and has been admitted to the ICU for multiple complications. He is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation, with a history of GI bleed, atrial fibrillation, and oliguria. He has required massive transfusion and has developed a NAG metabolic acidosis. He is also experiencing worsening opacities on CT and is being treated for possible fungal infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI bleed: The patient's GI bleed has been complicated by the development of melanotic stools, and he has required intermittent pressor support to maintain blood pressure. He has also had a recent hypotensive episode, which may have exacerbated the bleeding.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation has been complicated by the development of tachycardia, and he has required intermittent pressor support to maintain blood pressure.
3. Oliguria: The patient's oliguria may be secondary to hypovolemia, and he has required aggressive fluid resuscitation. He has also developed a NAG metabolic acidosis, which may be related to the use of normal saline boluses.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure has been complicated by the development of ARDS, and he has required aggressive resuscitation with crystalloid and colloid.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be secondary to hypovolemia, and he has required intermittent pressor support to maintain blood pressure.
6. Fungal infection: The patient is being treated for possible fungal infection, and his worsening opacities on CT may be related to this.
7. GVHD: The patient's GVHD may be exacerbating his immunosuppression, and he is at risk for developing further complications.
8. Refractory multiple myeloma: The patient's refractory multiple myeloma may be contributing to his overall illness and increasing his risk for complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and hemodynamic status closely, and adjust his fluid resuscitation and pressor support as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely, and adjust his ventilator settings as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's oliguria and acidosis, and adjust his fluid resuscitation and electrolyte management as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and tachycardia, and adjust his anticoagulation and rate control as needed.
5. Consider consulting with an infectious disease specialist to further evaluate the patient's possible fungal infection.
6. Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist to further evaluate the patient's GI bleed and potential complications.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's GVHD and adjust his immunosuppression as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's refractory multiple myeloma and adjust his treatment plan as needed."

   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man with refractory multiple myeloma who underwent mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and is currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, respiratory failure, oliguria, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and possible fungal infection. He has a history of multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia, ARF, right basilic vein thrombus, and suspected pulmonary embolism.

The patient's recent events include:

* GI bleed with profuse bright red blood per rectum, requiring emergent fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions
* Development of melanotic stools, which led to an emergent endoscopy to inject and clip a large duodenal ulcer
* Hypotension requiring intermittent pressor support
* Respiratory failure, intubated for airway protection
* Oliguria with low urine output and elevated creatinine
* AFib, currently untreated due to GI bleed
* Possible fungal infection, being treated with voriconazole
* ESBL E. coli bacteruria, being treated with meropenem

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* GI bleed: The patient is at risk for further bleeding, and IR embolization is being considered.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is being ventilated with minimal pressure support, and a SBT is planned today.
* Oliguria: The patient has low urine output and elevated creatinine, which may be due to volume depletion, ischemic ATN, or nephrotoxins.
* AFib: The patient is at risk for further arrhythmias, and his anticoagulation status is unclear.
* Possible fungal infection: The patient is being treated with voriconazole, and further evaluation is planned.
* ESBL E. coli bacteruria: The patient is being treated with meropenem, and ID is following.

The plan is to:

* Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP >30
* Continue aggressive fluid resuscitation and pressor support as needed
* Monitor creatinine and adjust fluid management accordingly
* Consider IR embolization for GI bleed
* Continue voriconazole treatment for possible fungal infection
* Continue meropenem treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteruria
* Monitor for signs of sepsis and adjust treatment accordingly
* Consider restarting Etanercept and Tacrolimus once GVHD is under control."

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   .
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   # Afib: Currently in afib with tachycardia. No anticoagulation given GI
   bleed. Patient has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Since the
   patient had a GI bleed, all of his PO nodal agents were D/C
ed. IV
   Lopressor and diltiazem were given to control the rate before switching
   over to a PO regimen.
   - cont metoprolol 75 TID (transferred on 100 mg TID) and dilt 90 mg
   QID.
   - cont to monitor on tele
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**]. Had melanotic stools
   recently, however, crits stable.
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - decide when pt can ADAT per BMT recs, otherwise NPO except meds
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with right IJ and midline
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - repeat Hct q12 (with transfusion goal >28) today given pt has been
   stable
   - H pylori negative
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure / hyponatremia: Patient initially
   presented with oliguria in setting of baseline Cr of 1.5 (feNa=0.04%),
   which was likely due to volume depletion from GI blood loss. However,
   given prolonged hypotension, the patient had also developed ischemic
   ATN. Now with BUN 81 Cr 1.6, FeNa 1.9, Uosm>500, CVP 11 c/w SIADH.
   Initially may have been [**12-17**] extubation, however, now etiologies unclear
   but may include pulmonary process, malignancy, pain, intracranial
   process (unlikely)
   - free water restrict 1L
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - check CVP to assess if volume depleted
   .
   .#. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - Tacrolimus re-started on [**6-10**]. Need to follow-up Tacrolimus level.
   - Check daily tacrolimus levels, as per onc.
   - Check daily LFTs, as per onc (bc on tacro).
   - Continue to hold Etanercept, as per onc.
   - cont Methylpred 30 mg IV Q12H. Will not taper methyl pred levels
   until review tacrolimus levels.
   - cont Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim, voriconazole
   .
   # HTN: Started on metoprolol PO and home dilt per above.
   .
   # Stage 4: sacral decubitus ulcer:
   - Continue wound care
   - low threshold for osteo if clinically suspicious
   .
   # ID:
   --Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment.
   - ID: bronch not necessary unless ICU team wants // vori can be changed
   to ppx dose if BMT ok since galactomannan and beta glucan markers for
   aspergillus negative.
   - Will hold on bronch now.
   - ? new lingular infiltrate vs atalectasis on CXR, clinically stable
   for now, so will repeat CXR tomorrow AM
   -- ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Finished 14/14 day course of meropenem.
   - f/u ID note.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure--resolved: Pt currently breathing on 3L NC.
   Initially, pt was intubated emergently for airway protection.  Pt given
   aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and colloid. Pt EF >55%,
   although may become overloaded.
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   .
   #. Hypotension: Issue resolved. Pt has initially required intermittent
   pressor support with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in
   the setting of GI bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without
   WBC although immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has
   been afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   -  IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])
   .
   # DM 2: Continue ISS
   .
   # FEN:
   -f/u BMT above whether pt needs to be NPO or if we can ADAT
   -continue TPN
   - PICC line for TPN necessary, as currently getting through midline,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma who underwent mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation. He has a complex hospital course complicated by parainfluenza pneumonia with ARDS, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia, ARF, right basilic vein thrombus, and suspected PE. He is currently in the ICU for gastrointestinal bleed and has a Stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer.

The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, and his medications include metoprolol and diltiazem to control his heart rate. He has also been diagnosed with acute on chronic renal failure and hyponatremia, and his medications include tacrolimus, methylprednisolone, and Cellcept.

The patient's wound care includes debridement of the sacral decubitus ulcer and low threshold for osteomyelitis if clinically suspicious. His respiratory support includes oxygen therapy and weaning as tolerated. His nutrition includes total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids, and his glycemic control is managed with insulin sensitivity testing (HISS).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Osteomyelitis: The patient's Stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer is at risk for osteomyelitis, and the low threshold for osteomyelitis if clinically suspicious suggests that the wound care team is monitoring for this complication.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia, and the CXR shows a question of new lingular infiltrate vs atelectasis, which could indicate pneumonia.
3. ARDS: The patient's history of parainfluenza pneumonia with ARDS suggests that he is at risk for ARDS again.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure and hyponatremia suggest that he is at risk for further renal dysfunction.
5. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleed and the presence of a duodenal ulcer suggest that he is at risk for further gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypotension and the need for intermittent pressor support suggest that he is at risk for further hypotension.
7. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and history of multiple infections suggest that he is at risk for further infections.

These potential medical complications will require close monitoring and management to prevent or treat them effectively."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   # Afib: Currently in afib with tachycardia. No anticoagulation given GI
   bleed. Patient has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Since the
   patient had a GI bleed, all of his PO nodal agents were D/C
ed. IV
   Lopressor and diltiazem were given to control the rate before switching
   over to a PO regimen.
   - cont metoprolol 75 TID (transferred on 100 mg TID) and dilt 90 mg
   QID.
   - cont to monitor on tele
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**]. Had melanotic stools
   recently, however, crits stable.
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - decide when pt can ADAT per BMT recs, otherwise NPO except meds
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with right IJ and midline
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - repeat Hct q12 (with transfusion goal >28) today given pt has been
   stable
   - H pylori negative
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure / hyponatremia: Patient initially
   presented with oliguria in setting of baseline Cr of 1.5 (feNa=0.04%),
   which was likely due to volume depletion from GI blood loss. However,
   given prolonged hypotension, the patient had also developed ischemic
   ATN. Now with BUN 81 Cr 1.6, FeNa 1.9, Uosm>500, CVP 11 c/w SIADH.
   Initially may have been [**12-17**] extubation, however, now etiologies unclear
   but may include pulmonary process, malignancy, pain, intracranial
   process (unlikely)
   - free water restrict 1L
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - check CVP to assess if volume depleted
   .
   .#. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - Tacrolimus re-started on [**6-10**]. Need to follow-up Tacrolimus level.
   - Check daily tacrolimus levels, as per onc.
   - Check daily LFTs, as per onc (bc on tacro).
   - Continue to hold Etanercept, as per onc.
   - cont Methylpred 30 mg IV Q12H. Will not taper methyl pred levels
   until review tacrolimus levels.
   - cont Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim, voriconazole
   .
   # HTN: Started on metoprolol PO and home dilt per above.
   .
   # Stage 4: sacral decubitus ulcer:
   - Continue wound care
   - low threshold for osteo if clinically suspicious
   .
   # ID:
   --Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment.
   - ID: bronch not necessary unless ICU team wants // vori can be changed
   to ppx dose if BMT ok since galactomannan and beta glucan markers for
   aspergillus negative.
   - Will hold on bronch now.
   - ? new lingular infiltrate vs atalectasis on CXR, clinically stable
   for now, so will repeat CXR tomorrow AM
   -- ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Finished 14/14 day course of meropenem.
   - f/u ID note.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure--resolved: Pt currently breathing on 3L NC.
   Initially, pt was intubated emergently for airway protection.  Pt given
   aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and colloid. Pt EF >55%,
   although may become overloaded.
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   .
   #. Hypotension: Issue resolved. Pt has initially required intermittent
   pressor support with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in
   the setting of GI bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without
   WBC although immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has
   been afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma who underwent mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). He has had a prolonged hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia, acute kidney injury (AKI), and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of his condition.

Current status:

* The patient is in atrial fibrillation (AFib) with a heart rate of 113 beats per minute.
* He has a Stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer with necrotic tissue and is being managed with wound care.
* He has acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL and is being managed with fluid restriction and avoidance of nephrotoxins.
* He has hyponatremia (sodium level of 131 mmol/L) and is being managed with fluid restriction and close monitoring.
* He has been treated with meropenem for ESBL E. coli bacteremia and has completed a 14-day course of antibiotics.
* He is receiving immunosuppressive therapy for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and is being monitored for signs of infection.

Potential medical complications:

* The patient is at risk for developing osteomyelitis due to his Stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer.
* He is at risk for developing further gastrointestinal bleeding due to his underlying condition and medications.
* He is at risk for developing further respiratory complications due to his underlying lung disease and medications.
* He is at risk for developing further kidney injury due to his underlying condition and medications.
* He is at risk for developing further electrolyte imbalances due to his underlying condition and medications.

Assessment and plan:

* The patient will continue to receive wound care for his sacral decubitus ulcer.
* He will continue to receive immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD and will be monitored for signs of infection.
* He will continue to receive antibiotics for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
* He will continue to receive fluid restriction and close monitoring for hyponatremia.
* He will continue to receive close monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding.
* He will continue to receive close monitoring for signs of respiratory complications.
* He will continue to receive close monitoring for signs of kidney injury.

Recommendations:

* The patient should be monitored closely for signs of osteomyelitis and further gastrointestinal bleeding.
* The patient should be monitored closely for signs of respiratory complications and further kidney injury.
* The patient should be monitored closely for signs of electrolyte imbalances and further hyponatremia.
* The patient should be considered for further imaging studies, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan, to rule out osteomyelitis and further gastrointestinal bleeding.
* The patient should be considered for further treatment options, such as surgery, for his sacral decubitus ulcer."

   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old gentleman with
   refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic
   SCT with hospital course complicated by Parainfluenza pneumonia with
   ARDS s/p trach, multiple ESBL pneumonias and bacteremia treated with
   meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin, ARF secondary to gentamycin
   and contrast treated with HD (off since [**5-4**]), right basilic vein
   thrombus and suspected PE after developing afib with RVR initially
   treated with heparin gtt held for iliopsoas hematoma, AMS with negative
   LP now resolved, and ESBL E. Coli bacteruria, GVHD and duodenal ulcer
   admitted to the MICU for GI bleed.
   .
   # Afib: Currently in afib with tachycardia. No anticoagulation given GI
   bleed. Patient has episodes of tachycardia to 140s-150s. Since the
   patient had a GI bleed, all of his PO nodal agents were D/C
ed. IV
   Lopressor and diltiazem were given to control the rate before switching
   over to a PO regimen.
   - On metoprolol 75 TID (transferred on 100 mg TID) and dilt 90 mg QID.
   - cont to monitor on tele
   .
   #. GI Bleed: Pt with profuse bright red blood per rectum with
   hemdynamic instability.  Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and
   pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of
   platelets).  He underwent emergent EGD by GI and were able to inject
   and endoclip a large healing ulcer that is the likely cause of the
   bleed.  He has required intermittent pressor support to maintain
   pressures.  On early AM of [**6-8**], the patient became hypotensive with a
   melanotic stool and needed an emergent EGD. GI found that the clips
   fell out of the large duodenal ulcer and it was actively oozing. GI
   placed a clip and said that they maximized their treatment. Surgery
   said that the patient would not be a good surgical candidate given his
   co-morbidities. Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization.
   Last required blood products on evening [**6-8**]. Had melanotic stools
   recently, however, crits stable.
   - appreciate GI, [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - maintain active T&C
   - Maintain access with right IJ and midline
   - maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support. UOP>30 cc/hr goal
   - IV PPI q12
   - NPO except meds
   - repeat Hct q12 (with transfusion goal >28) today given pt has been
   stable
   - f/u H pylori
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient initially presented with
   oliguria in setting of baseline Cr of 1.5 (feNa=0.04%), which was
   likely due to volume depletion from GI blood loss. However, given
   prolonged hypotension, the patient had also developed ischemic ATN. Now
   with BUN 81 Cr 1.6, FeNa 1.9, Uosm>500, CVP 11
   - cont to monitor Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   - check CVP to assess if volume depleted
   .
   # Hyponatremia: The patient developed hyponatremia (Na=132) and it
   complicated to tell if the volume status of the patient (hypovolemic
   vs. euvolemic vs. hypervolemic). Cr increased from 1.5
1.6. FeNa 1.9,
   Uosm>500. ? SIADH [**12-17**] ventilation.
   .
   .#. Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p
   mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now
   with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - Tacrolimus re-started on [**6-10**]. Need to follow-up Tacrolimus level.
   - Check daily tacrolimus levels, as per onc.
   - Check daily LFTs, as per onc (bc on tacro).
   - Continue to hold Etanercept, as per onc.
   - cont Methylpred 30 mg IV Q12H. Will not taper methyl pred levels
   until review tacrolimus levels.
   - cont Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID
   - cont ppx with Acyclovir, Bactrim, voriconazole
   .
   # HTN: Started on metoprolol PO and home dilt.
   .
   # Stage 4: sacral decubitus ulcer:
   - Continue wound care
   - low threshold for osteo if clinically suspicious
   .
   # Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID recommended doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for
   treatment.
   - ID: bronch not necessary unless ICU team wants // vori can be changed
   to ppx dose if BMT ok since galactomannan and beta glucan markers for
   aspergillus negative.
   - Will hold on bronch now.
   .
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Finished 14/14 day course of meropenem. ID is
   following.
   - f/u ID note.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure--resolved: Pt currently breathing on 3L NC.
   Initially, pt was intubated emergently for airway protection.  Pt given
   aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and colloid. Pt EF >55%,
   although may become overloaded.
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   .
   #. Hypotension: Issue resolved. Pt has initially required intermittent
   pressor support with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in
   the setting of GI bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without
   WBC although immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has
   been afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   -  IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   aspergillus negative.
   - Will hold on bronch now.
   .
   # ESBL E.coli bacteruria: Finished 14/14 day course of meropenem. ID is
   following.
   - f/u ID note.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure--resolved: Pt currently breathing on 3L NC.
   Initially, pt was intubated emergently for airway protection.  Pt given
   aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and colloid. Pt EF >55%,
   although may become overloaded.
   - Wean oxygen as tolerated
   .
   #. Hypotension: Issue resolved. Pt has initially required intermittent
   pressor support with neo and levo. Likely secondary to hypovolemia in
   the setting of GI bleed. Also sedation following intubation. Pt without
   WBC although immunosuppressed. No evidence new acute infection. Pt has
   been afebrile. Currently normotensive.
   - Maintain MAPS >65 and UOP>30.
   -  IJ CVL for CVP measurements (goal [**6-26**])

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma who underwent mini-allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for various complications. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) with tachycardia
* Gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, with ongoing bleeding and the need for pressor support
* Acute on chronic renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine (Cr) level of 1.6 mg/dL and a urine osmolarity (Uosm) of >500
* Hyponatremia (Na = 132) with a high FeNa (1.9) and Uosm (>500)
* Stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer
* ESBL E. coli bacteruria, which has been treated with a 14-day course of meropenem
* Respiratory failure, which has been resolved with the patient now breathing on 3L nasal cannula
* Hypotension, which has been resolved with the patient now normotensive

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Osteomyelitis, given the patient's history of sacral decubitus ulcer and immunosuppression
* Infection, given the patient's immunosuppressed state and ongoing bacteruria
* Renal failure, given the patient's ongoing ARF and hyponatremia
* Respiratory failure, given the patient's history of respiratory failure and ongoing use of pressor support
* Cardiovascular instability, given the patient's ongoing AFib and tachycardia
* GI bleeding, given the patient's ongoing bleeding and the need for pressor support
* Wound infection, given the patient's Stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer and immunosuppression

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Tacrolimus re-started on [**6-10**] with daily monitoring of levels
* Check daily LFTs and adjust tacrolimus levels as needed
* Continue to hold Etanercept, as per oncologist's recommendation
* Continue methylprednisolone 30 mg IV Q12H
* Continue Cellcept 400 mg IV BID
* Continue prophylaxis with Acyclovir, Bactrim, and voriconazole
* Maintain active T&C
* Maintain access with right IJ and midline
* Maintain MAPS >65, may need pressor support
* UOP >30 cc/hr goal
* IV PPI q12
* NPO except meds
* Repeat Hct q12 (with transfusion goal >28) today given pt has been stable
* f/u H pylori"
