You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 92.8 kg male with septic shock, acute respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. He was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, and has been receiving pressors to support blood pressure. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, and blood pressure of 117/72 mmHg. He has a central venous catheter and arterial line in place. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate, and liver enzymes, but normal electrolytes. He has a Code Blue status and is being managed in the ICU.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock is likely to cause organ dysfunction, particularly in the kidneys, liver, and lungs.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress to ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may require dialysis and increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's septic shock may cause cardiovascular instability, including hypotension and arrhythmias.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's septic shock may cause neurological complications, including altered mental status, seizures, and stroke.
6. Infection: The patient's septic shock may be caused by a variety of infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and intra-abdominal infections.
7. Multi-organ failure: The patient's septic shock may lead to multi-organ failure, including failure of the kidneys, liver, lungs, and cardiovascular system.
8. Poor wound healing: The patient's septic shock may impair wound healing, leading to delayed recovery and increased risk of complications.
9. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's septic shock may lead to nutritional deficiencies, particularly protein-calorie malnutrition, which can impede recovery.
10. Psychological distress: The patient's septic shock may cause psychological distress, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)."

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone po presents from home with acute onset chills and
   vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Septic Shock - Etiologies include gastroenteritis (viral and
   bacterial), aspiration pneumonia, biliary source, endocarditis. UA
   negative at OSH. CXR more concerning for pulmonary edema or ARDS vs.
   infiltrate. Abdominal exam benign and CT ab/pelvis w/out contrast
   unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern given home steroid use. No clear
   obstructive component but may have a cardiogenic component based on
   clinical exam on admission.
   - cover broadly for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV cefepime,
   flagyl, azithro
   - check [**Last Name (un) 1743**]
   - send stool for infectious diarrhea
   - f/u blood and urine cultures, send sputum
   - trend lactate, check SvO2 if remains hypotensive
   - bolus to CVP >12, transition off of dopamine to levophed with goal
   MAP >65
   - given home hydrocortisone, will start stress dose steroids
   - place A-line
   - consider RUQ if lactate non-responsive to fluids, pressors
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure - Patient required intubation in setting
   of lying flat with line placement. CXR consistent with volume overload,
   EF unknown.
   - cover with broad spectrum ABX as above
   - transition to PS as tolerated, decrease FIO2
   - once BP stablizes, consider diuresis
   - cycle cardiac enzymes, ECHO in am
   .
   # Emesis - As above, concerned for viral/bacterial gastroenteritis. No
   evidence of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam benign. OSH
   non-contrast CT ab/pelvis unremarkable.
   - stool cultues sent
   - zofran prn
   - trand LFTs
   - OG tube to low continuous suction, NPO except meds
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure - Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), up to 1.7 on admit.
   Discussed with wife that recently hydrocort/ketaconazole were resumed
   and she was concerned that these caused renal impairment in past. Like
   prerenal in setting of hypotension
   - trend with IVF, if persists send off urine lytes in am
   .
   # AVR/CHB pacer dependent - [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] on coumadin. Per wife INR 7.5 on
   last check [**1-24**] initiation of ketaconazole
   - hold coumadin in setting of elevated INR, trend closely with ABX
   regimen
   - check ECHO/cycle enzymes as above
   .
   # Prostate CA
   - holding ketoconazole in setting of N/V
   - po hydrocort switched to IV given shock
   - outpatient eval for ? sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Mild, baseline 160-200s
   - continue to trend
   - check DIC panel

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone po presents from home with acute onset chills and
   vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Septic Shock - Etiologies include gastroenteritis (viral and
   bacterial), aspiration pneumonia, biliary source, endocarditis. UA
   negative at OSH. CXR more concerning for pulmonary edema or ARDS vs.
   infiltrate. Abdominal exam benign and CT ab/pelvis w/out contrast
   unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern given home steroid use. No clear
   obstructive component but may have a cardiogenic component based on
   clinical exam on admission.
   - cover broadly for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV cefepime,
   flagyl, azithro
   - check [**Last Name (un) 1743**]
   - send stool for infectious diarrhea
   - f/u blood and urine cultures, send sputum
   - trend lactate, check SvO2 if remains hypotensive
   - bolus to CVP >12, transition off of dopamine to levophed with goal
   MAP >65
   - given home hydrocortisone, will start stress dose steroids
   - place A-line
   - consider RUQ if lactate non-responsive to fluids, pressors
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure - Patient required intubation in setting
   of lying flat with line placement. CXR consistent with volume overload,
   EF unknown.
   - cover with broad spectrum ABX as above
   - transition to PS as tolerated, decrease FIO2
   - once BP stablizes, consider diuresis
   - cycle cardiac enzymes, ECHO in am
   .
   # Emesis - As above, concerned for viral/bacterial gastroenteritis. No
   evidence of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam benign. OSH
   non-contrast CT ab/pelvis unremarkable.
   - stool cultues sent
   - zofran prn
   - trand LFTs
   - OG tube to low continuous suction, NPO except meds
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure - Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), up to 1.7 on admit.
   Discussed with wife that recently hydrocort/ketaconazole were resumed
   and she was concerned that these caused renal impairment in past. Like
   prerenal in setting of hypotension
   - trend with IVF, if persists send off urine lytes in am
   .
   # AVR/CHB pacer dependent - [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] on coumadin. Per wife INR 7.5 on
   last check [**1-24**] initiation of ketaconazole
   - hold coumadin in setting of elevated INR, trend closely with ABX
   regimen
   - check ECHO/cycle enzymes as above
   .
   # Prostate CA
   - holding ketoconazole in setting of N/V
   - po hydrocort switched to IV given shock
   - outpatient eval for ? sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Mild, baseline 160-200s
   - continue to trend
   - check DIC panel

* PO4: 3.2 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: consistent with pulmonary edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* CT abdomen/pelvis: unremarkable

The patient's medical history includes:

* AV replacement
* CHB pacer dependence
* Atrial fibrillation
* Prostate cancer
* Hydrocortisone therapy

Potential medical complications:

* Septic shock: the patient's blood cultures and sputum Gram stain were positive for multiple organisms, which may lead to further sepsis and organ dysfunction.
* Respiratory failure: the patient's chest X-ray shows pulmonary edema or ARDS, which may lead to further respiratory decline and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
* Acute renal failure: the patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may lead to further renal dysfunction and potential need for dialysis.
* Thrombocytopenia: the patient's platelet count is low, which may lead to bleeding complications.
* Cardiovascular complications: the patient's history of AV replacement and CHB pacer dependence may increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
* Gastrointestinal complications: the patient's history of prostate cancer and hydrocortisone therapy may increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding and perforation.

Recommendations:

* Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitor for signs of sepsis.
* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider mechanical ventilation if necessary.
* Monitor the patient's renal function and consider dialysis if necessary.
* Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider platelet transfusions if necessary.
* Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and consider antiarrhythmic medications if necessary.
* Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and consider proton pump inhibitors if necessary.
* Consider stress dose steroids if the patient's blood pressure remains low despite fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy.
* Consider RUQ ultrasound if the patient's lactate level remains elevated despite fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone po presents from home with acute onset chills and
   vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.
   # Septic Shock
   Presumably GI source from history. Also  possibly aspiration pneumonia,
   biliary source, endocarditis. UA negative at OSH. CXR more concerning
   for pulmonary edema or ARDS vs. infiltrate. Abdominal exam benign and
   CT ab/pelvis w/out contrast unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern
   given home steroid use. [**Month (only) 60**] have a cardiogenic component based on
   clinical exam on admission. On admission was on dopamine. Transistioned
   to levophed. Lactate trending down. CEs negative
   - continue broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV
   cefepime, flagyl, azithro
   - cont IVF to keep CVP > 12
   - contine levophed to keep MAP>60, attempt to titrate off
   - continue steroids
   - f/u cultures (sputum, viral swab, stool, blood, urine)
   - IVF to keep CVP >12
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
   Patient required intubation in setting of lying flat with line
   placement. CXR consistent with volume overload, EF unknown. FiO2 now
   40%.  Also concern for aspiration given emesis and question of opacity
   on CXR.
   - cover with broad spectrum ABX as above
   - wean sedation and transition to PS as tolerated, decrease FIO2
   - once BP stablizes, consider diuresis
   - repeat ECHO
   # Emesis
    As above, concerned for viral/bacterial gastroenteritis. No evidence
   of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam benign. OSH non-contrast CT
   ab/pelvis unremarkable.
   - stool cultues sent
   - zofran prn
   - trand LFTs
   - OG tube to low continuous suction, NPO except meds
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), up to 1.7 on admit. Prerenal less likely since
   UOP improved and creatinine unchanged. Likely ATN [**1-24**] hypotension. Also
   restarted hydrocort/ketaconazole recently.
   - send urine lytes, eos
   - trend creatinine
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   # AVR/CHB pacer dependent
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] on coumadin. Per wife INR 7.5 on last check [**1-24**] initiation of
   ketaconazole
   - hold coumadin in setting of elevated INR, trend closely with ABX
   regimen
   - check ECHO
   - CEs negative
   # Elevated LFTs
   CT at OSH unrevealing. Could be [**1-24**] shock liver.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone po presents from home with acute onset chills and
   vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.
   # Septic Shock
   Presumably GI source from history. Also  possibly aspiration pneumonia,
   biliary source, endocarditis. UA negative at OSH. CXR more concerning
   for pulmonary edema or ARDS vs. infiltrate. Abdominal exam benign and
   CT ab/pelvis w/out contrast unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern
   given home steroid use. [**Month (only) 60**] have a cardiogenic component based on
   clinical exam on admission. On admission was on dopamine. Transistioned
   to levophed. Lactate trending down. CEs negative
   - continue broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV
   cefepime, flagyl, azithro
   - cont IVF to keep CVP > 12
   - contine levophed to keep MAP>60, attempt to titrate off
   - continue steroids
   - f/u cultures (sputum, viral swab, stool, blood, urine)
   - IVF to keep CVP >12
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
   Patient required intubation in setting of lying flat with line
   placement. CXR consistent with volume overload, EF unknown. FiO2 now

   on CXR.
   - cover with broad spectrum ABX as above
   - wean sedation and transition to PS as tolerated, decrease FIO2
   - once BP stablizes, consider diuresis
   - repeat ECHO
   # Emesis
    As above, concerned for viral/bacterial gastroenteritis. No evidence
   of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam benign. OSH non-contrast CT
   ab/pelvis unremarkable.

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   76 yo M w/ [**Doctor Last Name 4969**] on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone po presents from home with acute onset chills and
   vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.
   # Septic Shock
   Presumably GI source from history. Also  possibly aspiration pneumonia,
   biliary source, endocarditis. UA negative at OSH. CXR more concerning
   for pulmonary edema or ARDS vs. infiltrate. Abdominal exam benign and
   CT ab/pelvis w/out contrast unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern
   given home steroid use. [**Month (only) 60**] have a cardiogenic component based on
   clinical exam on admission. On admission was on dopamine. Transistioned
   to levophed. Lactate trending down. CEs negative
   - continue broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV
   cefepime, flagyl, azithro
   - cont IVF to keep CVP > 12
   - contine levophed to keep MAP>60, attempt to titrate off
   - continue steroids
   - f/u cultures (sputum, viral swab, stool, blood, urine)
   - IVF to keep CVP >12
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
   Patient required intubation in setting of lying flat with line
   placement. CXR consistent with volume overload, EF unknown. FiO2 now
   40%.  Also concern for aspiration given emesis and question of opacity
   on CXR.
   - cover with broad spectrum ABX as above
   - wean sedation and transition to PS as tolerated, decrease FIO2
   - once BP stablizes, consider diuresis
   - repeat ECHO
   # Emesis
    As above, concerned for viral/bacterial gastroenteritis. No evidence
   of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam benign. OSH non-contrast CT
   ab/pelvis unremarkable.
   - send stool, f/u other cultures
   - zofran prn
   - trand LFTs
   - OG tube to low continuous suction, NPO except meds
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), up to 1.7 on admit. Prerenal less likely since
   UOP improved and creatinine unchanged. Likely ATN [**1-24**] hypotension. Also
   restarted hydrocort/ketaconazole recently.
   - send urine lytes, eos
   - trend creatinine
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   # [**Month/Day (2) 4969**]/CHB pacer dependent
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] on coumadin. Per wife INR 7.5 on last check [**1-24**] initiation of
   ketaconazole
   - hold coumadin in setting of elevated INR, trend closely with ABX
   regimen
   - check ECHO
   - CEs negative
   # Elevated LFTs
   CT at OSH unrevealing. Could be [**1-24**] shock liver.
   - trend
   # Prostate CA
   - holding ketoconazole in setting of N/V
   - po hydrocort switched to IV given shock
   - outpatient eval for ? sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia - Mild, baseline 160-200s. DIC labs negative
   - continue to trend

   MICU WEEKEND COVERAGE ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   76 y/o [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 4721**]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4969**], Afib, CHF, pacer, prostate ca, here with N/V,
   septic shock unclear source.
   Overnight pressors being weaned.  Lactate of 2.7, normalized.  Cardiac
   enzymes negative.
   Tm101.5, BP 117/70
 up to 160s/80s in room, with stimulation.  P A/C
   550x16/5/40% sat 100% ABG 7.37/37/165 on 50%.  V paced at 60.  CVP
   10-14.  U/O 50-100.
   Exam notable for sedated and intubated.  Opens eyes but not following
   commands.
   Neck supple, no [**Doctor First Name **].
   RRR mechanical S2, RR.  Lungs CTA b/l anteriorly / laterally.
   Abd soft NT/ND +BS. Extremities warm.  No edema.
   WBC 14 -> 15, Hct 36.9 Plt 192.
   Chem7 with bicarb of 22, Cr 1.7 (baseline 1.3).
   ALT/AST 68/82 Alk phos 145
 rising.
   INR 4.8.
   Cultures all NGTD / pending (here / [**Hospital1 2244**])
   Meds notable for levophed, cefepime, flagyl, azithro; hydrocort.
   Off fentanyl and versed as of 8am.
   76 y/o with septic shock, acute on chronic renal failure, respiratory
   failure.
   Agree with plan to continue to treat broadly for sepsis of unclear
   etiology, signs of improvement with lactate decreasing, pressor
   requirement decreasing.  Continue to wean pressors, and give stress
   does steroids.  Await cultures from OSH and here.
   Will obtain echo here given [**Hospital1 4969**], shock, though by Vigileo stroke volume
   appears to be adequate, relatively bradycardic.  Sedation now off, plan
   for PSV and SBT depending on mental status.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   76 yo M w/ [**Doctor Last Name 4969**] on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone po presents from home with acute onset chills and
   vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.
   # Septic Shock
   Presumably GI source from history. Also  possibly aspiration pneumonia,
   biliary source, endocarditis. UA negative at OSH. CXR more concerning
   for pulmonary edema or ARDS vs. infiltrate. Abdominal exam benign and
   CT ab/pelvis w/out contrast unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern
   given home steroid use. [**Month (only) 60**] have a cardiogenic component based on
   clinical exam on admission. On admission was on dopamine. Transistioned
   to levophed. Lactate trending down. CEs negative
   - continue broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV
   cefepime, flagyl, azithro
   - cont IVF to keep CVP > 12
   - contine levophed to keep MAP>60, attempt to titrate off
   - continue steroids
   - f/u cultures (sputum, viral swab, stool, blood, urine)
   - IVF to keep CVP >12
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
   Patient required intubation in setting of lying flat with line
   placement. CXR consistent with volume overload, EF unknown. FiO2 now
   40%.  Also concern for aspiration given emesis and question of opacity
   on CXR.
   - cover with broad spectrum ABX as above
   - wean sedation and transition to PS as tolerated, decrease FIO2
   - once BP stablizes, consider diuresis
   - repeat ECHO
   # Emesis
    As above, concerned for viral/bacterial gastroenteritis. No evidence
   of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam benign. OSH non-contrast CT
   ab/pelvis unremarkable.
   - send stool, f/u other cultures
   - zofran prn
   - trand LFTs
   - OG tube to low continuous suction, NPO except meds
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), up to 1.7 on admit. Prerenal less likely since
   UOP improved and creatinine unchanged. Likely ATN [**1-24**] hypotension. Also
   restarted hydrocort/ketaconazole recently.
   - send urine lytes, eos
   - trend creatinine
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   # [**Month/Day (2) 4969**]/CHB pacer dependent
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] on coumadin. Per wife INR 7.5 on last check [**1-24**] initiation of
   ketaconazole
   - hold coumadin in setting of elevated INR, trend closely with ABX
   regimen
   - check ECHO
   - CEs negative
   # Elevated LFTs
   CT at OSH unrevealing. Could be [**1-24**] shock liver.
   - trend
   # Prostate CA
   - holding ketoconazole in setting of N/V
   - po hydrocort switched to IV given shock
   - outpatient eval for ? sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia - Mild, baseline 160-200s. DIC labs negative
   - continue to trend

   MICU WEEKEND COVERAGE ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:

[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4969**], Afib, CHF, pacer, prostate ca, here with N/V,
   septic shock unclear source.
   Overnight pressors being weaned.  Lactate of 2.7, normalized.  Cardiac
   enzymes negative.
   Tm101.5, BP 117/70
 up to 160s/80s in room, with stimulation.  P A/C
   550x16/5/40% sat 100% ABG 7.37/37/165 on 50%.  V paced at 60.  CVP
   10-14.  U/O 50-100.
   Exam notable for sedated and intubated.  Opens eyes but not following
   commands.
   Neck supple, no [**Doctor First Name **].
   RRR mechanical S2, RR.  Lungs CTA b/l anteriorly / laterally.
   Abd soft NT/ND +BS. Extremities warm.  No edema.
   WBC 14 -> 15, Hct 36.9 Plt 192.

   ALT/AST 68/82 Alk phos 145
 rising.
   INR 4.8.
   Cultures all NGTD / pending (here / [**Hospital1 2244**])
   Meds notable for levophed, cefepime, flagyl, azithro; hydrocort.
   Off fentanyl and versed as of 8am.
   76 y/o with septic shock, acute on chronic renal failure, respiratory
   failure.
   Agree with plan to continue to treat broadly for sepsis of unclear
   etiology, signs of improvement with lactate decreasing, pressor
   requirement decreasing.  Continue to wean pressors, and give stress
   does steroids.  Await cultures from OSH and here.
   Will obtain echo here given [**Hospital1 4969**], shock, though by Vigileo stroke volume
   appears to be adequate, relatively bradycardic.  Sedation now off, plan
   for PSV and SBT depending on mental status.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

* Platelet count (Plt) of 192 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 22 mEq/L
* Creatinine (Cr) of 1.7 mg/dL
* Lactic acid of 0.9 mmol/L
* Troponin-T of 0.02 ng/mL
* C-reactive protein (CRP) of 68 mg/L

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray (CXR) with bilateral pulmonary edema and infiltrates
* Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showing no significant abnormalities

The patient's medical history includes:

* Prostate cancer
* Chronic atrial fibrillation (Afib)
* Cardiac pacemaker dependence
* History of hydrocortisone use
* Recent initiation of ketoconazole

The patient's current medications include:

* Levophed (norepinephrine) for blood pressure support
* Cefepime for broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage
* Flagyl for anaerobic coverage
* Azithromycin for respiratory coverage
* Hydrocortisone for stress dosing
* Fentanyl and midazolam for sedation

The patient's current status is:

* Septic shock with unclear source
* Acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation
* Acute renal failure with rising creatinine
* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST)
* Thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 192 K/uL)

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for sepsis
* Weaning pressors and stress dosing steroids
* Obtaining further cultures and imaging studies
* Monitoring for signs of improvement and adjusting therapy accordingly

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure requiring increased mechanical ventilation support
* Acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring dialysis
* Septic shock leading to cardiovascular collapse
* Coagulopathy or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
* Infection-related complications, such as pneumonia or abscesses
* Cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or myocardial infarction
* Neurological complications, such as seizures or cerebral edema

The patient's critical illness and complex medical history make it essential to closely monitor their status and adjust therapy accordingly to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone po presents from home with acute onset chills and
   vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.
   # Septic Shock
   Presumably GI source from history. Also  possibly aspiration pneumonia,
   biliary source, endocarditis. UA negative at OSH. CXR more concerning
   for pulmonary edema or ARDS vs. infiltrate. Abdominal exam benign and
   CT ab/pelvis w/out contrast unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern
   given home steroid use. [**Month (only) 60**] have a cardiogenic component based on
   clinical exam on admission. On admission was on dopamine. Transistioned
   to levophed. Lactate trending down. CEs negative
   - continue broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV
   cefepime, flagyl, azithro
   - cont IVF to keep CVP > 12
   - contine levophed to keep MAP>60, attempt to titrate off
   - continue steroids
   - f/u cultures (sputum, viral swab, stool, blood, urine)
   - IVF to keep CVP >12
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
   Patient required intubation in setting of lying flat with line
   placement. CXR consistent with volume overload, EF unknown. FiO2 now
   40%.  Also concern for aspiration given emesis and question of opacity
   on CXR.
   - cover with broad spectrum ABX as above
   - wean sedation and transition to PS as tolerated, decrease FIO2
   - once BP stablizes, consider diuresis
   - repeat ECHO
   # Emesis
    As above, concerned for viral/bacterial gastroenteritis. No evidence
   of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam benign. OSH non-contrast CT
   ab/pelvis unremarkable.
   - send stool, f/u other cultures
   - zofran prn
   - trand LFTs
   - OG tube to low continuous suction, NPO except meds
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), up to 1.7 on admit. Prerenal less likely since
   UOP improved and creatinine unchanged. Likely ATN [**1-24**] hypotension. Also
   restarted hydrocort/ketaconazole recently.
   - send urine lytes, eos
   - trend creatinine
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   # AVR/CHB pacer dependent
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] on coumadin. Per wife INR 7.5 on last check [**1-24**] initiation of
   ketaconazole
   - hold coumadin in setting of elevated INR, trend closely with ABX
   regimen
   - check ECHO
   - CEs negative
   # Elevated LFTs
   CT at OSH unrevealing. Could be [**1-24**] shock liver.
   - trend
   # Prostate CA
   - holding ketoconazole in setting of N/V
   - po hydrocort switched to IV given shock
   - outpatient eval for ? sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia - Mild, baseline 160-200s. DIC labs negative
   - continue to trend

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # Septic Shock
   Presumably GI source from history. Also  possibly aspiration pneumonia,
   biliary source, endocarditis. UA negative at OSH. CXR more concerning
   for pulmonary edema or ARDS vs. infiltrate. Abdominal exam benign and
   CT ab/pelvis w/out contrast unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern
   given home steroid use. [**Month (only) 60**] have a cardiogenic component based on
   clinical exam on admission. On admission was on dopamine. Transistioned
   to levophed. Lactate trending down. CEs negative
   - continue broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV
   cefepime, flagyl, azithro
   - cont IVF to keep CVP > 12
   - contine levophed to keep MAP>60, attempt to titrate off
   - continue steroids
   - f/u cultures (sputum, viral swab, stool, blood, urine)
   - IVF to keep CVP >12
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
   Patient required intubation in setting of lying flat with line
   placement. CXR consistent with volume overload, EF unknown. FiO2 now
   40%.  Also concern for aspiration given emesis and question of opacity
   on CXR.
   - cover with broad spectrum ABX as above
   - wean sedation and transition to PS as tolerated, decrease FIO2
   - once BP stablizes, consider diuresis
   - repeat ECHO
   # Emesis
    As above, concerned for viral/bacterial gastroenteritis. No evidence
   of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam benign. OSH non-contrast CT
   ab/pelvis unremarkable.
   - send stool, f/u other cultures
   - zofran prn
   - trand LFTs
   - OG tube to low continuous suction, NPO except meds
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), up to 1.7 on admit. Prerenal less likely since
   UOP improved and creatinine unchanged. Likely ATN [**1-24**] hypotension. Also
   restarted hydrocort/ketaconazole recently.
   - send urine lytes, eos
   - trend creatinine
   - avoid nephrotoxins

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, prostate cancer, and is taking coumadin and hydrocortisone. He presented with acute onset chills and vomiting, followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.

The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including cefepime, flagyl, and azithromycin, for presumed gastrointestinal and pulmonary sources. He is also receiving levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg and is being closely monitored for signs of shock.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, indicating tissue hypoperfusion. His blood cultures are pending, and he is being treated for possible aspiration pneumonia, biliary source, and endocarditis.

The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 412, indicating severe hypoxemia. He is being ventilated with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40% and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, indicating acute renal failure. He is being closely monitored for signs of worsening renal function and is receiving fluids to maintain a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis-induced multiorgan dysfunction: The patient's septic shock and elevated lactate levels indicate a high risk of developing multiorgan dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and hypercapnia indicate a high risk of developing respiratory failure, which could progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output indicate a high risk of developing acute kidney injury, which could progress to chronic kidney disease.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding and elevated lactate levels indicate a high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be exacerbated by the use of anticoagulants.
5. Endocarditis: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and prosthetic valve placement increase his risk of developing endocarditis, which could lead to septicemia and multiorgan dysfunction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed gastrointestinal and pulmonary sources.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilator settings as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust fluid management and antihypertensive therapy as necessary.
4. Consider the use of vasopressors to maintain a MAP of 60 mmHg.
5. Consider the use of activated protein C to prevent and treat disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely and consider the use of antacids and proton pump inhibitors to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Consider the use of steroids to reduce inflammation and prevent multiorgan dysfunction.
8. Monitor the patient's mental status closely and consider the use of sedatives and analgesics as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Septic shock: The patient is at risk for further septic shock due to the presence of sepsis, urinary source, and abdominal exam benign. The patient's INR is still elevated, and the doctor is holding coumadin in setting of elevated INR, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, and the doctor is concerned about the possibility of ARDS. The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 125, which is within the normal range, but the doctor is monitoring the patient closely for any changes.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and the doctor is concerned about the possibility of ATN. The patient's creatinine level is 1.7, and the doctor is trending it closely.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, and the doctor is concerned about the possibility of hemolysis. The patient's Haptoglobin level is <5, which is low, and the doctor is rechecking it.
5. Delirium: The patient has delirium, and the doctor is concerned about the possibility of steroid-induced delirium. The patient's steroids are being weaned down, and the doctor is considering holding zofran.
6. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure, and the doctor is concerned about the possibility of ARDS. The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 125, which is within the normal range, but the doctor is monitoring the patient closely for any changes.
7. Elevated LFTs: The patient has elevated LFTs, and the doctor is concerned about the possibility of shock liver. The patient's LFTs are trending down, but the doctor is monitoring the patient closely for any changes.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has mild thrombocytopenia, and the doctor is concerned about the possibility of DIC. The patient's platelet count is trending down, and the doctor is monitoring the patient closely for any changes.

Based on the patient's progress note, the doctor's assessment and plan include:

1. Continue broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV cefepime and flagyl.
2. DC azithro as no evidence of pulmonary pathology.
3. Continue IVF to keep CVP > 12.
4. Wean steroids to 50mg IV Q8H.
5. F/u cultures (sputum, stool, blood, urine).
6. Contact OSH for culture data.
7. Consider holding zofran.
8. Frequent reorientation.
9. Pull A line and PIV.
10. Call out to floor may benefit pt.

The doctor's plan also includes monitoring the patient's vital signs, lab results, and imaging studies, as well as adjusting the patient's medications and treatment plan as necessary."

   pulmonary edema have been present for several days and mild-to-moderate
   cardiomegaly is chronic.  ET tube and right internal jugular line,
   transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are all

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone po presents from home with acute onset chills and
   vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.
   # Septic Shock
   Presumably urinary source given positive urine cultures with group B
   strep and e. coli. Abdominal exam benign and CT ab/pelvis w/out
   contrast unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern given home steroid use.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have a cardiogenic component based on clinical exam on admission.
   Off pressors for 24 hours. Apparently had a similar bout of urosepsis
   after urologic procedure 3 years ago with very small amount of bacteria
   in urine.
   - continue broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV
   cefepime, flagyl
   - DC azithro as no evidence of pulmonary pathology
   - cont IVF to keep CVP > 12
   - wean off steroids
   - f/u cultures (sputum, stool, blood, urine)
   - contact OSH [**Name (NI) **] for culture data
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
   Patient required intubation in setting of lying flat with line
   placement. CXR consistent with volume overload, EF unknown. FiO2 now
   40%.  Also concern for aspiration given emesis and question of opacity
   on CXR. CXR today is clear suggesting this was pulmonary edema and
   unlikely pulmonary source of infection.
   - cover with broad spectrum ABX as above
   - wean sedation and transition to PS as tolerated, decrease FIO2
   - once BP stablizes, consider diuresis
   - repeat ECHO
   # Anemia: Possibly hemodilutional given all 4 counts are down, consider
   hemolysis given hapto <5 although T bili and LD normal, consider GI
   bleed.
   - Recheck hapto
   - Recheck HCT
   - Guiac all stools
   - CVP and PIV in place
   - Maintain active T/S
   # Emesis
    Resolved for now. As above, concerned for viral/bacterial
   gastroenteritis. No evidence of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam
   benign. OSH non-contrast CT ab/pelvis unremarkable.
   - send stool, f/u other cultures
   - zofran prn
   - trand LFTs
   - OG tube pulled
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), up to 1.7 on admit. Improved to 1.3, probable
   prerenal, although ATN not ruled out.
   - f/u urine lytes, eos
   - trend creatinine
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   # AVR/CHB pacer dependent
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] on coumadin. INR still elevated at 6.5 (goal 2.5-3.5) no e/o
   bleed, but downtrending HCT.
   - hold coumadin in setting of elevated INR, trend closely with ABX
   regimen
   - Recheck HCT
   - check ECHO
   - CEs negative
   # Elevated LFTs
   CT at OSH unrevealing. Could be [**1-24**] shock liver.
   - trend
   # Prostate CA
   - holding ketoconazole in setting of N/V
   - po hydrocort switched to IV given shock
   - outpatient eval for ? sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia - Mild, baseline 160-200s. DIC labs negative
   - continue to trend

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of atrioventricular valve replacement (AVR) on coumadin, chronic heart failure (CHB) pacer dependent, atrial fibrillation (Afib), and prostate cancer on hydrocortisone. He presented to the hospital with acute onset chills and vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.

The patient has been diagnosed with:

1. Septic Shock: Presumably of urinary origin, with positive urine cultures showing group B strep and E. coli.
2. Respiratory Failure: Acute, not ARDS, with CXR showing progressive heterogeneous opacification at the base of the left lung, which could be due to pneumonia and increasing moderate left pleural effusion.
3. Renal Failure: Acute, with baseline creatinine of 1.3, up to 1.7 on admission, and improved to 1.3, likely prerenal, but ATN not ruled out.
4. Anemia: Possibly hemodilutional, considering all 4 counts are down, and considering hemolysis, GI bleed, or other causes.
5. Emesis: Resolved for now, with concern for viral/bacterial gastroenteritis, no evidence of obstruction, and benign exam.

The patient is currently receiving treatment for:

1. Septic Shock: IV cefepime and flagyl for broad-spectrum coverage.
2. Respiratory Failure: Weaning off sedation, transitioning to pressure support, and decreasing FiO2.
3. Renal Failure: F/U urine lytes, eos, and creatinine, and avoiding nephrotoxins.
4. Anemia: Rechecking hapto, HCT, and stool for GI bleed.
5. Emesis: Sending stool and f/u cultures, and using zofran prn.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction (e.g., acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome).
2. Pneumonia-related complications (e.g., respiratory failure, pleural effusion).
3. Renal failure-related complications (e.g., electrolyte imbalance, acidosis).
4. Anemia-related complications (e.g., hypoxia, cardiovascular instability).
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding-related complications (e.g., hypovolemic shock, coagulopathy).
6. Cardiovascular complications (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock).
7. Infection-related complications (e.g., secondary infections, septic shock).

The patient's ongoing management should focus on addressing these potential complications and optimizing his treatment plan to prevent further deterioration."

 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone po presents from home with acute onset chills and
   vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.
   # Septic Shock
   Presumably GI source from history. Also  possibly aspiration pneumonia,
   biliary source, endocarditis. UA negative at OSH. CXR more concerning
   for pulmonary edema or ARDS vs. infiltrate. Abdominal exam benign and
   CT ab/pelvis w/out contrast unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern
   given home steroid use. [**Month (only) 60**] have a cardiogenic component based on
   clinical exam on admission. On admission was on dopamine. Transistioned
   to levophed. Lactate trending down. CEs negative
   - continue broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV
   cefepime, flagyl, azithro
   - cont IVF to keep CVP > 12
   - contine levophed to keep MAP>60, attempt to titrate off
   - continue steroids
   - f/u cultures (sputum, viral swab, stool, blood, urine)
   - contact OSH [**Name2 (NI) **] for culture data
   - IVF to keep CVP >12
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
   Patient required intubation in setting of lying flat with line
   placement. CXR consistent with volume overload, EF unknown. FiO2 now
   40%.  Also concern for aspiration given emesis and question of opacity
   on CXR.
   - cover with broad spectrum ABX as above
   - wean sedation and transition to PS as tolerated, decrease FIO2
   - once BP stablizes, consider diuresis
   - repeat ECHO
   # Anemia: Likely hemodilutional, consider GI bleed, hemolysis although
   T bili and LD normal
   - Check hapto
   - Guiac all stools
   - CVP and PIV in place
   - Maintain active T/S
   # Emesis
    As above, concerned for viral/bacterial gastroenteritis. No evidence
   of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam benign. OSH non-contrast CT
   ab/pelvis unremarkable.
   - send stool, f/u other cultures
   - zofran prn
   - trand LFTs
   - OG tube to low continuous suction, NPO except meds
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), up to 1.7 on admit. Improved to 1.3, probable
   prerenal, although ATN not ruled out.
   - send urine lytes, eos
   - trend creatinine
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   # AVR/CHB pacer dependent
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] on coumadin. INR still elevated at 6.5 (goal 2.5-3.5) no e/o
   bleed, but downtrending HCT.
   - hold coumadin in setting of elevated INR, trend closely with ABX
   regimen
   - check ECHO
   - CEs negative
   # Elevated LFTs
   CT at OSH unrevealing. Could be [**1-24**] shock liver.
   - trend
   # Prostate CA
   - holding ketoconazole in setting of N/V
   - po hydrocort switched to IV given shock
   - outpatient eval for ? sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia - Mild, baseline 160-200s. DIC labs negative
   - continue to trend

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone po presents from home with acute onset chills and
   vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.
   # Septic Shock
   Presumably GI source from history. Also  possibly aspiration pneumonia,
   biliary source, endocarditis. UA negative at OSH. CXR more concerning
   for pulmonary edema or ARDS vs. infiltrate. Abdominal exam benign and
   CT ab/pelvis w/out contrast unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern
   given home steroid use. [**Month (only) 60**] have a cardiogenic component based on
   clinical exam on admission. On admission was on dopamine. Transistioned
   to levophed. Lactate trending down. CEs negative
   - continue broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV
   cefepime, flagyl, azithro
   - cont IVF to keep CVP > 12
   - contine levophed to keep MAP>60, attempt to titrate off
   - continue steroids
   - f/u cultures (sputum, viral swab, stool, blood, urine)
   - contact OSH [**Name2 (NI) **] for culture data
   - IVF to keep CVP >12
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
   Patient required intubation in setting of lying flat with line
   placement. CXR consistent with volume overload, EF unknown. FiO2 now
   40%.  Also concern for aspiration given emesis and question of opacity
   on CXR.
   - cover with broad spectrum ABX as above
   - wean sedation and transition to PS as tolerated, decrease FIO2
   - once BP stablizes, consider diuresis
   - repeat ECHO
   # Anemia: Likely hemodilutional, consider GI bleed, hemolysis although
   T bili and LD normal
   - Check hapto
   - Guiac all stools
   - CVP and PIV in place
   - Maintain active T/S
   # Emesis
    As above, concerned for viral/bacterial gastroenteritis. No evidence
   of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam benign. OSH non-contrast CT
   ab/pelvis unremarkable.
   - send stool, f/u other cultures
   - zofran prn
   - trand LFTs
   - OG tube to low continuous suction, NPO except meds
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), up to 1.7 on admit. Improved to 1.3, probable
   prerenal, although ATN not ruled out.
   - send urine lytes, eos
   - trend creatinine
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   # AVR/CHB pacer dependent
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] on coumadin. INR still elevated at 6.5 (goal 2.5-3.5) no e/o
   bleed, but downtrending HCT.
   - hold coumadin in setting of elevated INR, trend closely with ABX
   regimen
   - check ECHO
   - CEs negative
   # Elevated LFTs
   CT at OSH unrevealing. Could be [**1-24**] shock liver.
   - trend
   # Prostate CA
   - holding ketoconazole in setting of N/V
   - po hydrocort switched to IV given shock
   - outpatient eval for ? sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia - Mild, baseline 160-200s. DIC labs negative

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient, a 76-year-old male with a history of prosthetic aortic valve replacement, CHB pacer dependence, atrial fibrillation, and prostate cancer, was admitted with acute onset chills, vomiting, septic shock, and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. His INR is elevated at 6.5, and he is on coumadin.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 15.6
* Hct: 36.9
* Plt: 192
* Cr: 1.7
* TropT: 0.02
* TCO2: 20
* Glucose: 192
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 57.8/57.4/6.5, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 70/3/<0.01, ALT/AST: 49/39, Alk Phos/T Bili: 112/0.5, Amylase/Lipase: 64/,

Imaging studies show:

* CXR: Progressive heterogeneous opacification at the base of the left lung, possibly due to a combination of pneumonia and increasing moderate left pleural effusion.
* CT ab/pelvis w/out contrast: Unremarkable.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Septic shock, presumably of gastrointestinal origin
* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
* Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF)
* Anemia, likely hemodilutional, with possible gastrointestinal bleed or hemolysis
* Emesis, possibly due to viral/bacterial gastroenteritis
* Elevated LFTs, possibly due to shock liver
* Thrombocytopenia, mild, with negative DIC labs
* Prostate cancer, with possible sclerotic lesions on CT ab/pelvis

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Further deterioration of respiratory failure
* Worsening of septic shock
* Progression of renal failure
* Development of acute tubular necrosis (ATN)
* Increased risk of bleeding due to elevated INR
* Potential for gastrointestinal bleed or hemolysis
* Possible development of aspiration pneumonia
* Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias due to CHB pacer dependence
* Potential for sclerotic lesions to progress or spread

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, I recommend:

* Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia
* Maintaining invasive ventilation and weaning sedation as tolerated
* Titrating off levophed and monitoring for signs of cardiogenic shock
* Trending creatinine and avoiding nephrotoxins
* Holding coumadin in setting of elevated INR and trending closely with antibiotic regimen
* Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleed or hemolysis
* Considering diuresis once blood pressure stabilizes
* Repeating ECHO to assess cardiac function
* Maintaining active thromboprophylaxis
* Monitoring for signs of sclerotic lesions progression or spread."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 92.8 kg male with a chief complaint of pneumonia. The patient was intubated on 2/17 at 10:00 PM and was successfully extubated on 2/18 with no complications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 36.6°C, Tcurrent of 35.6°C, HR of 60 bpm, BP of 152/70 mmHg, RR of 15 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 97%.

The patient has a history of morphine allergy, nausea, and vomiting. The patient is receiving antibiotics, including Azithromycin, Cefipime, and Metronidazole. The patient's INR is elevated, and TEDs were removed to prevent extravasation. The patient's urine lytes are suggestive of prerenal etiology.

The patient has a history of respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and septic shock. The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC, Hct, and Cr, and decreased Plt and TCO2. The patient's imaging studies show progressive heterogeneous opacification at the base of the left lung, which could be due to pneumonia and increasing moderate left pleural effusion.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and the patient may require further respiratory support.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and the patient may require dialysis.
3. Septic shock: The patient's INR is elevated, and the patient may be at risk for further complications.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, and the patient may require further antibiotic therapy.
5. Pleural effusion: The patient's pleural effusion may worsen, and the patient may require further drainage.
6. Cardiomegaly: The patient's cardiomegaly may worsen, and the patient may require further cardiac evaluation.
7. VAP: The patient is at risk for VAP, and the patient may require further prophylaxis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Respiratory support: The patient will continue to receive respiratory support, including oxygen therapy and pressure support.
2. Renal support: The patient will continue to receive renal support, including fluid management and dialysis as needed.
3. Antibiotic therapy: The patient will continue to receive antibiotic therapy, including Azithromycin, Cefipime, and Metronidazole.
4. INR management: The patient's INR will be closely monitored, and the patient will receive further management as needed.
5. Pneumonia treatment: The patient will receive further treatment for pneumonia, including antibiotics and respiratory support.
6. Pleural effusion management: The patient will receive further management for pleural effusion, including drainage and respiratory support.
7. Cardiac evaluation: The patient will receive further cardiac evaluation, including echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization as needed.
8. VAP prophylaxis: The patient will receive further prophylaxis for VAP, including stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP prevention measures."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities and complex medical issues. Here is a summary of the patient's condition:

* The patient is intubated and on invasive ventilation, with a recent weaning attempt on 2/18 at 2:30 PM.
* The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile toxin A & B infection and is currently receiving vancomycin, flagyl, and fluconazole.
* The patient has acute respiratory failure, with a SpO2 of 97% on 40% FiO2 and is on CPAP/PSV mode with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.
* The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL and is receiving fluids.
* The patient has a central venous catheter and is receiving vasopressors.
* The patient's hemodynamic parameters are unstable, with a blood pressure of 152/70 mmHg and a heart rate of 60-63 bpm.
* The patient has a recent history of septic shock, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F) and a white blood cell count of 15.6.
* The patient has a recent history of Clostridium difficile toxin A & B infection and is currently receiving vancomycin, flagyl, and fluconazole.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

* Pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's prolonged intubation and respiratory failure.
* Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's recent history of Clostridium difficile toxin A & B infection and the presence of central venous catheters.
* Acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease due to the patient's acute renal failure and prolonged use of vasopressors.
* Respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the patient's prolonged intubation and respiratory failure.
* Mucormycosis or other fungal infections due to the patient's prolonged use of antifungal medications and the presence of central venous catheters.
* Bloodstream infections or sepsis due to the patient's recent history of Clostridium difficile toxin A & B infection and the presence of central venous catheters.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to the patient's history of Clostridium difficile toxin A & B infection and the use of antibiotics.
* Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias due to the patient's prolonged use of vasopressors and the presence of central venous catheters.
* Neurological complications, such as seizures or encephalopathy, due to the patient's prolonged use of vasopressors and the presence of central venous catheters."

   24 Hour Events:
   [**2-19**]
   - Urine cultures also growing group B strep
   - Pt in florrid delerium, AOx0 and agitated thought to be steroid
   induced delerium, with concominant toxic metabolic and ICU delerium
   contributing. He's currently on 2-4mg haldol IV TID PRN agitation,
   requiring restraints. This was later increased to 4-6mg haldol IV TID
   PRN. QTC on tele remained stable, attempted to get 12 lead w/o success.
   - Pt became hypertensive to 190s during agitation for a few minutes,
   was given hydral IV ONCE to good affect
   - We are weaning off his steroids going from 100mg IV Q8H to 50mg IV
   Q8H
   - Restarted his home lasix of 40mg PO Daily
   - Nurses concerned he was volume overloaded slightly as was net +
   600ccs, new rhales, and CVP 15-19. Was given an additional 20mg IV
   lasix ONCE
   -Still wheezy, agitated, ?dyspneic and net positive by 5am, given
   another 40mg IV Lasix ONCE
   -Developed R conjuntival hemorrhage likely secondary to elevated INR
   and possibly from hypertension. No visual defecits noted.
   -Hypertension returned to 160s systolic, was started on hydralazine 5mg
   IV Q6H as home lisinopril may worsen resolving ARF.
   -Stopped steroids as this was thought to be the cause of his delerium
   -Having continued dyspnea and upper airway sounds, likely secondary to
   agitation but possibility of laryngospasm. Apparently haldol can do
   this, so stopping Haldol and switching to zyprexa PRN.
   -Gave benadryl in case laryngeal edema ET tube caused inflammation and
   concern for airway compromise, (less likely, and more likely secondary
   to agitation)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 92.8 kg male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, acute renal failure, and septic shock. He is currently receiving mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and antibiotics. The patient's condition has been complicated by steroid-induced delirium, which was managed with haloperidol and later switched to zyprexa. He has also developed respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and septic shock. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate levels, indicating an ongoing inflammatory response. Imaging studies reveal moderate cardiomegaly and no appreciable pleural effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Increased risk of respiratory failure due to ongoing inflammation and potential for lung injury.
2. Progressive acute renal failure requiring further nephrology consultation and potential dialysis.
3. Ongoing septic shock requiring close monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic parameters.
4. Potential for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest, given the patient's underlying cardiomegaly.
5. Risk of further respiratory complications, such as laryngospasm, due to agitation and potential for airway compromise.
6. Need for close monitoring of electrolyte levels, particularly potassium and magnesium, to prevent arrhythmias and other complications.
7. Risk of further delirium and agitation requiring continued management with antipsychotics and benzodiazepines.
8. Potential for development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) requiring aggressive antibiotic therapy and potential for tracheostomy.
9. Need for close monitoring of bleeding risk due to elevated INR and potential for gastrointestinal bleeding.
10. Risk of further complications, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), given the patient's ongoing septic shock and inflammatory response."

   24 Hour Events:
   [**2-19**]
   - Urine cultures also growing group B strep
   - Pt in florrid delerium, AOx0 and agitated thought to be steroid
   induced delerium, with concominant toxic metabolic and ICU delerium
   contributing. He's currently on 2-4mg haldol IV TID PRN agitation,
   requiring restraints. This was later increased to 4-6mg haldol IV TID
   PRN. QTC on tele remained stable, attempted to get 12 lead w/o success.
   - Pt became hypertensive to 190s during agitation for a few minutes,
   was given hydral IV ONCE to good affect
   - We are weaning off his steroids going from 100mg IV Q8H to 50mg IV
   Q8H
   - Restarted his home lasix of 40mg PO Daily
   - Nurses concerned he was volume overloaded slightly as was net +
   600ccs, new rhales, and CVP 15-19. Was given an additional 20mg IV
   lasix ONCE
   -Still wheezy, agitated, ?dyspneic and net positive by 5am, given
   another 40mg IV Lasix ONCE
   -Developed R conjuntival hemorrhage likely secondary to elevated INR
   and possibly from hypertension. No visual defecits noted.
   -Hypertension returned to 160s systolic, was started on hydralazine 5mg
   IV Q6H as home lisinopril may worsen resolving ARF.
   -Stopped steroids as this was thought to be the cause of his delerium
   -Having continued dyspnea and upper airway sounds, likely secondary to
   agitation but possibility of laryngospasm. Apparently haldol can do
   this, so stopping Haldol and switching to zyprexa PRN.
   -Gave benadryl in case laryngeal edema ET tube caused inflammation and
   concern for airway compromise, (less likely, and more likely secondary
   to agitation)

   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone po presents from home with acute onset chills and
   vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.
   # Septic Shock
   Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive urine cultures with
   group B strep and e. coli. Abdominal exam benign and CT ab/pelvis w/out
   contrast unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern given home steroid use.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have a cardiogenic component based on clinical exam on admission.
   Off pressors for 24 hours. Apparently had a similar bout of urosepsis
   after urologic procedure 3 years ago with very small amount of bacteria
   in urine.
   - continue broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV
   cefepime, flagyl
   - DC azithro as no evidence of pulmonary pathology
   - cont IVF to keep CVP > 12
   - wean steroids to 50mg IV Q8H
   - f/u cultures (sputum, stool, blood, urine)
   - contact OSH [**Name (NI) **] for culture data
   # Delerium: No focal findings, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**] nature most c/w
   steroid induced vs toxic metabolic in setting of ICU stay and recent
   septic shock.
   - Stopped steroids
   - Consider holding zofran
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Pull A line and PIV
   - Call out to floor may benefit pt
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure; Resolved. 96% on RA.
   # Anemia: Consider hemolysis given hapto <5 although T bili normal and
   LD trending down, consider GI bleed.
   - Recheck hapto
   - Recheck HCT
   - Guiac all stools
   - CVP and PIV in place
   - Maintain active T/S
   # Emesis
    Resolved for now. Possibly [**1-24**] sepsis vs viral gastroenteritis. No
   evidence of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam benign. OSH
   non-contrast CT ab/pelvis unremarkable.
   - send stool, f/u other cultures
   - zofran prn
   - trand LFTs
   - OG tube pulled
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), up to 1.7 on admit. Improved to 1.3, probable
   prerenal, although ATN not ruled out.
   - f/u urine lytes, eos
   - trend creatinine
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   # AVR/CHB pacer dependent
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] on coumadin. INR still elevated at 6.5 (goal 2.5-3.5) no e/o
   bleed, but downtrending HCT.
   - holding coumadin in setting of elevated INR, trend closely with ABX
   regimen
   - Recheck HCT
   - check ECHO
   - CEs negative
   # Elevated LFTs
   Improving. CT at OSH unrevealing. Could be [**1-24**] shock liver.
   - trend
   # Prostate CA
   - holding ketoconazole in setting of N/V
   - po hydrocort switched to IV given shock
   - outpatient eval for ? sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia - Mild, baseline 160-200s. DIC labs negative

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone po presents from home with acute onset chills and
   vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.
   # Septic Shock
   Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive urine cultures with
   group B strep and e. coli. Abdominal exam benign and CT ab/pelvis w/out
   contrast unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern given home steroid use.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have a cardiogenic component based on clinical exam on admission.
   Off pressors for 24 hours. Apparently had a similar bout of urosepsis
   after urologic procedure 3 years ago with very small amount of bacteria
   in urine.
   - continue broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV
   cefepime, flagyl
   - DC azithro as no evidence of pulmonary pathology
   - cont IVF to keep CVP > 12
   - wean steroids to 50mg IV Q8H
   - f/u cultures (sputum, stool, blood, urine)
   - contact OSH [**Name (NI) **] for culture data
   # Delerium: No focal findings, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**] nature most c/w
   steroid induced vs toxic metabolic in setting of ICU stay and recent
   septic shock.
   - Stopped steroids
   - Consider holding zofran
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Pull A line and PIV
   - Call out to floor may benefit pt
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure; Resolved. 96% on RA.
   # Anemia: Consider hemolysis given hapto <5 although T bili normal and
   LD trending down, consider GI bleed.
   - Recheck hapto
   - Recheck HCT
   - Guiac all stools
   - CVP and PIV in place
   - Maintain active T/S
   # Emesis
    Resolved for now. Possibly [**1-24**] sepsis vs viral gastroenteritis. No
   evidence of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam benign. OSH
   non-contrast CT ab/pelvis unremarkable.
   - send stool, f/u other cultures
   - zofran prn
   - trand LFTs
   - OG tube pulled
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), up to 1.7 on admit. Improved to 1.3, probable
   prerenal, although ATN not ruled out.
   - f/u urine lytes, eos
   - trend creatinine
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   # AVR/CHB pacer dependent
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] on coumadin. INR still elevated at 6.5 (goal 2.5-3.5) no e/o
   bleed, but downtrending HCT.
   - holding coumadin in setting of elevated INR, trend closely with ABX
   regimen
   - Recheck HCT
   - check ECHO
   - CEs negative
   # Elevated LFTs
   Improving. CT at OSH unrevealing. Could be [**1-24**] shock liver.
   - trend
   # Prostate CA
   - holding ketoconazole in setting of N/V
   - po hydrocort switched to IV given shock
   - outpatient eval for ? sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia - Mild, baseline 160-200s. DIC labs negative

   Comments:
   Communication:  Comments:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Delirium: The patient's delirium is likely caused by steroid-induced encephalopathy, toxic metabolic encephalopathy, and ICU delirium. The patient's agitation and agitation-induced laryngospasm are concerns.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is a concern, particularly given the elevated INR and possibility of bleeding. The patient is being treated with hydralazine, and the blood pressure is being closely monitored.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is improving, but there is still a concern about the possibility of laryngospasm and upper airway sounds.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is improving, but the creatinine level is still elevated. The patient is at risk for nephrotoxicity, and the urine electrolytes and eosinophils are being closely monitored.
5. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock has resolved, but there is still a concern about the possibility of sepsis and the need for continued broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely caused by hemolysis, and the patient is at risk for bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin level is being closely monitored, and the patient is being treated with transfusions as necessary.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is mild and is being closely monitored. The patient is at risk for bleeding, and the patient's platelet count is being closely monitored.
8. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient's elevated liver enzymes are improving, but the patient is still at risk for liver damage. The patient's liver enzymes are being closely monitored, and the patient is being treated with antiviral medication as necessary.
9. Prostate cancer: The patient's prostate cancer is being treated with ketoconazole, and the patient is being monitored for any signs of progression.
10. Cardiac issues: The patient's cardiac issues are being monitored, and the patient is being treated with anticoagulation therapy as necessary.

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia
* Weaning of steroids to 50mg IV Q8H
* Frequent reorientation and monitoring for delirium
* Monitoring of blood pressure and INR
* Monitoring of renal function and urine electrolytes
* Monitoring of platelet count and hemoglobin level
* Monitoring of liver enzymes
* Monitoring of cardiac function
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* Nutrition: Regular, low sodium, lactose-free
* Glycemic control: ISS as on steroids"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Urine cultures grew GBS
   - Patient in agitated delirium, A&Ox0, thought to be multifactorial,
   steroid induced vs toxic metabolic vs ICU delirium
   - Steroids initially weaned from 100mg IV Q8H to 50mg IV Q8H, but
   ultimately held overnight [**1-24**] delirium
   - Placed on 4-6mg Haldol IV TID PRN w/ restraints. QTc on tele remained
   stable, unable to get 12 lead.
   - Patient became hypertensive to 190s during agitation, resolved with
   Hydralazine x 1, but hypertension returned later in the night to 160
   placed on standing Hydralazine 5mg IV q6H
   -Developed R conjuntival hemorrhage likely secondary to elevated INR
   and possibly from hypertension. No visual defecits noted.
   - Restarted home Lasix 40mg PO daily, but received another Lasix 20mg
   IV x 1 for concern for volume overload (+ 600ccs, new rales, and CVP
   15-19), remained wheezy, agitated, and net positive by 5am, given
   another 40mg IV Lasix x 1
   - Continued to have dyspnea and upper airway sounds, thought to be from
   agitation vs laryngospasm, so Haldol was switched to Zyprexa PRN
   -Gave Benadryl in case laryngeal edema ET tube caused inflammation and
   concern for airway compromise

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Pneumonia
   24 Hour Events:
   - Urine cultures grew GBS
   - Patient in agitated delirium, A&Ox0, thought to be multifactorial,
   steroid induced vs toxic metabolic vs ICU delirium
   - Steroids initially weaned from 100mg IV Q8H to 50mg IV Q8H, but
   ultimately held overnight [**1-24**] delirium
   - Placed on 4-6mg Haldol IV TID PRN w/ restraints. QTc on tele remained
   stable, unable to get 12 lead.
   - Patient became hypertensive to 190s during agitation, resolved with
   Hydralazine x 1, but hypertension returned later in the night to 160
   placed on standing Hydralazine 5mg IV q6H
   -Developed R conjuntival hemorrhage likely secondary to elevated INR
   and possibly from hypertension. No visual defecits noted.
   - Restarted home Lasix 40mg PO daily, but received another Lasix 20mg
   IV x 1 for concern for volume overload (+ 600ccs, new rales, and CVP
   15-19), remained wheezy, agitated, and net positive by 5am, given
   another 40mg IV Lasix x 1
   - Continued to have dyspnea and upper airway sounds, thought to be from
   agitation vs laryngospasm, so Haldol was switched to Zyprexa PRN
   -Gave Benadryl in case laryngeal edema ET tube caused inflammation and
   concern for airway compromise

   - Monitor closely for visual changes and other sources of bleeding
   - Daily HCT
   - ECHO to evaluate EF/? New wall motion abnormality
   - Pull central line when INR at goal
   # Septic Shock: Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive GBS
   & E. coli urine cultures. Afebrile, downtrending WBC, not requiring
   pressors. Unconcerning abdominal imaging at OSH. Patient w/ h/o
   urosepsis after urologic procedure ~ 3 years ago.
   - Continue broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV
   Cefepime, Flagyl day 3
   - Continue to hold Hydrocortisone
   - IVF PRN to maintain CVP > 12
   - F/u respiratory viral culture pending from [**2-17**]
   - Contact OSH [**Name2 (NI) **] for any additional culture data
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Resolved. 96% on RA. Remains wheezy
   with rales, but improved with diuresis
   - Continue to monitor
   # Anemia: Stable at 36.5 today. Concern for hemolysis given hapto <5,
   but no Hct has not downtrended.
   - Trend HCT
   - Guaiac all stools
   - CVP and PIV in place
   - Maintain active T/S
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), 1.7 on admission. FeNa on [**2-18**] 8.7, c/w ATN, but
   Cr improved to 1.4 today, so appears at baseline.
   - Trend BUN/Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   # Elevated LFTs: Nearly resolved. Only abnormal value is modestly
   elevated ALT to 44.
   - Trend qOD
   # Prostate CA:
   - Continue to hold Ketoconazole, but could restart if QT stable & INR
   not supratherapeutic
   - Continue to hold steroids
   - Outpatient eval for ? sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia: PLT count 135 this AM. Mild, baseline 160-200s. DIC
   labs negative.
   - Continue to trend

   Disposition: call out with improvement in delirium, bed availability<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications and concerns have arisen:

1. Delirium: The patient is experiencing florid delirium, which is multifactorial, possibly caused by steroid-induced, toxic metabolic, or ICU delirium. The patient's agitation is being managed with Haldol, which has been switched to Zyprexa PRN. The patient's delirium is a concern due to the risk of falls, self-extubation, and worsening respiratory status.
2. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is 5.8, which is supratherapeutic and requires close monitoring. The patient is at risk of bleeding, particularly with the presence of conjunctival hemorrhage. The INR needs to be closely monitored, and the patient's Coumadin should be held until the INR is at goal.
3. Septic Shock: The patient has resolved septic shock, but there is a concern about the source of the infection, as the patient has a history of urosepsis. The patient's urine cultures grew GBS and E. coli, which suggests a urinary source. The patient's broad coverage antibiotics should be continued, and the patient's urine cultures should be closely monitored.
4. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient has resolved hypoxic respiratory distress, but the patient remains wheezy with rales. The patient's diuresis has improved, but the patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, but the patient's Hct has not downtrended, which is a concern. The patient's Hct should be closely monitored, and the patient should be trended for hemolysis.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's Cr has improved to 1.4, which suggests that the patient's acute renal failure is resolving. However, the patient's BUN/Cr should be closely monitored to ensure that the patient's kidney function is improving.
7. Elevated LFTs: The patient's LFTs are nearly resolved, but the patient's ALT is still elevated at 44. The patient's LFTs should be closely monitored and trended.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's PLT count is 135, which is mild and stable. The patient's thrombocytopenia should be closely monitored, and the patient should be trended for DIC.

The patient's ICU care plan should include:

* Frequent reorientation to manage delirium
* Holding steroids and hydrocortisone
* Continuing broad coverage antibiotics for septic shock
* Monitoring the patient's INR and holding Coumadin until the INR is at goal
* Trending the patient's Hct and monitoring for hemolysis
* Monitoring the patient's kidney function and BUN/Cr
* Monitoring the patient's LFTs and trended
* Trending the patient's PLT count and monitoring for DIC
* Providing prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer
* Monitoring the patient's respiratory status and adjusting therapy as needed
* Continuing to hold Ketoconazole and restarting it only if the patient's QT is stable and INR is not supratherapeutic
* Continuing to hold steroids and restarting it only if the patient's delirium improves and the patient's QT is stable."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Pneumonia
   24 Hour Events:
   - Urine cultures grew GBS
   - Patient in agitated delirium, A&Ox0, thought to be multifactorial,
   steroid induced vs toxic metabolic vs ICU delirium
   - Steroids initially weaned from 100mg IV Q8H to 50mg IV Q8H, but
   ultimately held overnight [**1-24**] delirium
   - Placed on 4-6mg Haldol IV TID PRN w/ restraints. QTc on tele remained
   stable, unable to get 12 lead.
   - Patient became hypertensive to 190s during agitation, resolved with
   Hydralazine x 1, but hypertension returned later in the night to 160
   placed on standing Hydralazine 5mg IV q6H
   -Developed R conjuntival hemorrhage likely secondary to elevated INR
   and possibly from hypertension. No visual defecits noted.
   - Restarted home Lasix 40mg PO daily, but received another Lasix 20mg
   IV x 1 for concern for volume overload (+ 600ccs, new rales, and CVP
   15-19), remained wheezy, agitated, and net positive by 5am, given
   another 40mg IV Lasix x 1
   - Continued to have dyspnea and upper airway sounds, thought to be from
   agitation vs laryngospasm, so Haldol was switched to Zyprexa PRN
   -Gave Benadryl in case laryngeal edema ET tube caused inflammation and
   concern for airway compromise

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of aortic valve replacement, chronic atrial fibrillation, and prostate cancer, who was admitted to the ICU with acute onset chills and vomiting, followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. He has been treated for septic shock, pneumonia, and delirium. His current condition is stable, but he is still at risk for various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Delirium: The patient's delirium is multifactorial, caused by steroid-induced, toxic metabolic, and ICU delirium. He is being treated with Zyprexa PRN and will be closely monitored for signs of worsening delirium.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is a concern, especially given his history of chronic atrial fibrillation and aortic valve replacement. He is being treated with Hydralazine IV q6H, and his blood pressure will be closely monitored.
3. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient's respiratory failure has resolved, he is still at risk for further respiratory complications, especially given his history of pneumonia.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is a concern, especially given his history of chronic kidney disease. His creatinine levels will be closely monitored, and he will be treated with IV fluids as needed.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is mild, but it will be closely monitored, and he will be treated with platelet transfusions as needed.
6. Elevated LFTs: The patient's elevated LFTs are nearly resolved, but he will be closely monitored, and his liver function will be rechecked regularly.
7. Prostate Cancer: The patient's prostate cancer is being treated with Ketoconazole, which will be restarted if his QT interval stabilizes and his INR returns to normal.
8. Thrombotic Complications: Given the patient's history of aortic valve replacement and chronic atrial fibrillation, he is at risk for thrombotic complications, especially given his supratherapeutic INR. He will be closely monitored for signs of thrombosis, and his anticoagulation therapy will be adjusted as needed.
9. GI Bleed: The patient's anemia is a concern, and he is at risk for GI bleeding, especially given his history of chronic kidney disease and prostate cancer. He will be closely monitored for signs of GI bleeding, and his hemoglobin levels will be rechecked regularly.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but he is still at risk for various medical complications. He will be closely monitored, and his treatment plan will be adjusted as needed to prevent or manage these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone po presents from home with acute onset chills and
   vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.
   # Septic Shock
   Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive urine cultures with
   group B strep and e. coli. Abdominal exam benign and CT ab/pelvis w/out
   contrast unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern given home steroid use.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have a cardiogenic component based on clinical exam on admission.
   Off pressors for 24 hours. Apparently had a similar bout of urosepsis
   after urologic procedure 3 years ago with very small amount of bacteria
   in urine.
   - continue broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV
   cefepime, flagyl
   - DC azithro as no evidence of pulmonary pathology
   - cont IVF to keep CVP > 12
   - wean steroids to 50mg IV Q8H
   - f/u cultures (sputum, stool, blood, urine)
   - contact OSH [**Name (NI) **] for culture data
   # Delerium: No focal findings, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**] nature most c/w
   steroid induced vs toxic metabolic in setting of ICU stay and recent
   septic shock.
   - Stopped steroids
   - Consider holding zofran
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Pull A line and PIV
   - Call out to floor may benefit pt
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure; Resolved. 96% on RA.
   # Anemia: Consider hemolysis given hapto <5 although T bili normal and
   LD trending down, consider GI bleed.
   - Recheck hapto
   - Recheck HCT
   - Guiac all stools
   - CVP and PIV in place
   - Maintain active T/S
   # Emesis
    Resolved for now. Possibly [**1-24**] sepsis vs viral gastroenteritis. No
   evidence of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam benign. OSH
   non-contrast CT ab/pelvis unremarkable.
   - send stool, f/u other cultures
   - zofran prn
   - trand LFTs
   - OG tube pulled
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), up to 1.7 on admit. Improved to 1.3, probable
   prerenal, although ATN not ruled out.
   - f/u urine lytes, eos
   - trend creatinine
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   # AVR/CHB pacer dependent
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] on coumadin. INR still elevated at 6.5 (goal 2.5-3.5) no e/o

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Pneumonia
   24 Hour Events:
   - Urine cultures also growing group B strep
   - Pt in agitated delirium, A&Ox0, thought to be multifactorial, steroid
   induced/ toxic metabolic/ ICU delirium
   -  On 4-6mg haldol IV TID PRN w/ restraints. QTC on tele remained
   stable, unable to get 12 lead.
   - Pt became hypertensive to 190s during agitation for a few minutes,
   was given hydral IV ONCE to good affect
   - Steroids weaned from 100mg IV Q8H to 50mg IV Q8H
   - Restarted home Lasix 40mg PO daily
   - Nurses concerned patient was volume overloaded, net + 600ccs, new
   rales, and CVP 15-19. Given an additional 20mg IV Lasix ONCE
   -Still wheezy, agitated, ?dyspneic and net positive by 5am, given
   another 40mg IV Lasix ONCE
   -Developed R conjuntival hemorrhage likely secondary to elevated INR
   and possibly from hypertension. No visual defecits noted.
   -Hypertension returned to 160
s systolic, was started on Hydralazine
   5mg IV Q6H
   -Stopped steroids as this was thought to be the cause of his delerium
   -Having continued dyspnea and upper airway sounds, likely secondary to
   agitation but possibility of laryngospasm, so stopped Haldol and
   switched to Zyprexa PRN.
   -Gave Benadryl in case laryngeal edema ET tube caused inflammation and
   concern for airway compromise, (lmore likely secondary to agitation)

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of atrioventricular replacement (AVR), cardiogenic shock, and prostate cancer on hydrocortisone. He was admitted with acute onset chills and vomiting, followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* He is still agitated and delirious, with a possible contribution from steroid-induced delirium, toxic metabolic encephalopathy, and ICU delirium.
* He has a group B strep infection, which is likely the source of his septic shock.
* His blood pressure is hypertensive, requiring treatment with hydralazine.
* He has developed a conjunctival hemorrhage, likely secondary to elevated INR and possibly hypertension.
* He has ongoing dyspnea and upper airway sounds, which may be secondary to agitation or laryngospasm.
* His respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 96%.
* His renal function is improving, with a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL.
* His liver function tests are improving, with a trend towards normalizing.
* He has mild thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 192 x 10^9/L.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further worsening of his delirium, leading to increased risk of falls, injuries, and prolonged ICU stay.
* Development of respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
* Progression of his septic shock, leading to multi-organ dysfunction.
* Development of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
* Development of liver failure or chronic liver disease.
* Development of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
* Development of cardiovascular complications, such as atrial fibrillation or cardiac arrhythmias.
* Development of infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or central line-associated bloodstream infection.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics for his septic shock and pneumonia.
* Weaning steroids to 50mg IV Q8H.
* Maintaining IV fluids to keep CVP > 12 mmHg.
* Reorienting the patient frequently to prevent delirium.
* Holding zofran to prevent nausea and vomiting.
* Pulling the nasogastric tube and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.
* Monitoring the patient's liver function tests and platelet count.
* Trending the patient's creatinine and electrolyte levels.
* Avoiding nephrotoxins and maintaining active fluid management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 92.8 kg male admitted with pneumonia, who has developed group B strep in his urine cultures. He is experiencing agitation, delirium, and is thought to be multifactorial, possibly due to steroid-induced, toxic metabolic, and ICU delirium. He has been treated with haloperidol (Haldol) IV TID PRN with restraints, and has been weaned off steroids. He has also been given hydralazine IV for hypertension, and has developed a right conjunctival hemorrhage likely secondary to elevated INR and possibly hypertension.

The patient has been experiencing dyspnea and upper airway sounds, possibly secondary to agitation or laryngospasm, and has been switched to Zyprexa PRN. He has also been given Benadryl in case of laryngeal edema from the endotracheal tube.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Tmax: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* Tcurrent: 36.1°C (97°F)
* HR: 66 bpm (60-88 bpm)
* BP: 136/77 mmHg (93-123 mmHg)
* RR: 21 inspirations per minute (13-24 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 96%
* Heart rhythm: V paced

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 15.6 K/uL
* Hct: 36.9%
* Plt: 192 K/uL
* Cr: 1.7 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.02 ng/mL
* TCO2: 20 mmHg
* Glucose: 192 mg/dL

The patient's imaging results show:

* CXR: Moderate cardiomegaly is longstanding, and there is no appreciable pleural effusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Septic shock
* Respiratory failure, acute
* Renal failure, acute
* Laryngospasm
* Hypertensive crisis
* Volume overload
* Delirium
* ICU-acquired weakness
* Pneumonia progression
* Group B strep infection progression
* Endotracheal tube-related complications (e.g. laryngeal edema)
* Cardiac complications (e.g. arrhythmias) due to cardiomegaly
* Metabolic complications (e.g. hyperglycemia) due to stress response."

   -Developed R conjuntival hemorrhage likely secondary to elevated INR
   and possibly from hypertension. No visual defecits noted.
   - Restarted home Lasix 40mg PO daily, but received another Lasix 20mg
   IV x 1 for concern for volume overload (+ 600ccs, new rales, and CVP
   15-19), remained wheezy, agitated, and net positive by 5am, given

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Pneumonia
   24 Hour Events:
   - Urine cultures grew GBS
   - Patient in agitated delirium, A&Ox0, thought to be multifactorial,
   steroid induced vs toxic metabolic vs ICU delirium
   - Steroids initially weaned from 100mg IV Q8H to 50mg IV Q8H, but
   ultimately held overnight [**1-24**] delirium
   - Placed on 4-6mg Haldol IV TID PRN w/ restraints. QTc on tele remained
   stable, unable to get 12 lead.
   - Patient became hypertensive to 190s during agitation, resolved with
   Hydralazine x 1, but hypertension returned later in the night to 160
   placed on standing Hydralazine 5mg IV q6H
   -Developed R conjuntival hemorrhage likely secondary to elevated INR
   and possibly from hypertension. No visual defecits noted.
   - Restarted home Lasix 40mg PO daily, but received another Lasix 20mg
   IV x 1 for concern for volume overload (+ 600ccs, new rales, and CVP
   15-19), remained wheezy, agitated, and net positive by 5am, given
   another 40mg IV Lasix x 1
   - Continued to have dyspnea and upper airway sounds, thought to be from
   agitation vs laryngospasm, so Haldol was switched to Zyprexa PRN
   -Gave Benadryl in case laryngeal edema ET tube caused inflammation and
   concern for airway compromise

   Disposition: call out with improvement in delirium, bed availability<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of atrioventricular replacement, chronic atrial fibrillation, and prostate cancer on hydrocortisone, who presented with acute onset chills and vomiting, followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU with ongoing respiratory and cardiovascular instability.

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Delirium: The patient is agitated and has a fluctuating affect, which is likely multifactorial, possibly related to steroid-induced delirium, toxic metabolic encephalopathy, or ICU delirium. The patient is receiving Haldol and Zyprexa for agitation.
2. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is elevated at 5.8, which is above the therapeutic range of 2.5-3.5. This is concerning given the patient's pacer dependence and history of atrioventricular replacement. The patient is at risk for bleeding, particularly conjunctival hemorrhage, which has already occurred.
3. Septic Shock: The patient has resolved septic shock, but the source of the infection is still pending. The patient has positive cultures for GBS and E. coli in the urine.
4. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient remains wheezy with rales, but has improved with diuresis.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable at 36.5%, but there is concern for hemolysis given the patient's hapto <5.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine has improved to 1.4, but the patient is still at risk for acute renal failure.
7. Elevated LFTs: The patient's liver function tests are nearly resolved, but the patient's ALT is still mildly elevated at 44.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 135, which is mildly decreased. The patient is at risk for bleeding.
9. Prostate CA: The patient's prostate cancer is being managed with hydrocortisone, and the patient is being restarted on steroids.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to the supratherapeutic INR and thrombocytopenia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient remains wheezy with rales and has a history of septic shock, which increases the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine has improved, but the patient is still at risk for acute kidney injury.
4. Hemolysis: The patient's anemia is stable, but there is concern for hemolysis given the patient's hapto <5.
5. Infection: The patient has positive cultures for GBS and E. coli in the urine, which increases the risk of infection.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Delirium management: The patient will continue to receive Haldol and Zyprexa for agitation, and will be restarted on home steroids.
2. INR management: The patient will continue to have daily INR monitoring, and Coumadin will be held.
3. Septic shock management: The patient will continue to receive antibiotics and will be restarted on hydrocortisone.
4. Respiratory management: The patient will continue to receive diuresis and will be monitored for respiratory failure.
5. Anemia management: The patient's anemia will be trended, and guaiac will be performed on all stools.
6. Acute renal failure management: The patient's creatinine will be trended, and nephrotoxic agents will be avoided.
7. Elevated LFTs management: The patient's liver function tests will be trended, and the patient will be restarted on steroids.
8. Thrombocytopenia management: The patient's platelet count will be trended, and the patient will be monitored for bleeding.
9. Prostate CA management: The patient's prostate cancer will be managed with hydrocortisone, and the patient will be restarted on steroids.

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

1. Nutrition: Regular, low sodium, lactose-free.
2. Glycemic control: ISS as on steroids.
3. Lines: Multi-lumen line.
4. Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis with systemic anticoagulation, and stress ulcer prophylaxis with H2 blocker.
5. VAP prophylaxis: VAP prophylaxis will be implemented."

   steroid induced vs toxic metabolic vs ICU delirium
   - Steroids initially weaned from 100mg IV Q8H to 50mg IV Q8H, but
   ultimately held overnight [**1-24**] delirium
   - Placed on 4-6mg Haldol IV TID PRN w/ restraints. QTc on tele remained
   stable, unable to get 12 lead.

   -Developed R conjuntival hemorrhage likely secondary to elevated INR
   and possibly from hypertension. No visual defecits noted.
   - Restarted home Lasix 40mg PO daily, but received another Lasix 20mg
   IV x 1 for concern for volume overload (+ 600ccs, new rales, and CVP
   15-19), remained wheezy, agitated, and net positive by 5am, given
   another 40mg IV Lasix x 1

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone presents from home with acute onset chills and vomiting
   followed by septic shock and respiratory failure, now resolving.
   # Delirium: No focal findings, most c/w steroid induced vs toxic
   metabolic in setting of ICU stay and recent septic shock.
   - Zyprexa PRN: agitation
   - Restart home steroids
   - Consider holding zofran
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Pull A line and PIV
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Patient pacer dependent s/p AVR with St. Jude
   valve on Coumadin. INR still supratherapeutic at 5.8 (goal 2.5-3.5)
   with e/o of conjunctival hemorrhage, but stable HCT.
   - Continue to hold Coumadin
   - Monitor closely for visual changes and other sources of bleeding
   - Daily HCT
   - F/U ECHO to evaluate EF/? New wall motion abnormality
   - Pull central line
   # Septic Shock: Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive GBS
   & E. coli urine cultures. Afebrile, downtrending WBC, not requiring
   pressors. Unconcerning abdominal imaging at OSH. Patient w/ h/o
   urosepsis after urologic procedure ~ 3 years ago.
   - D/C IV Cefepime, Flagyl & started Cepodoxime, day [**3-1**]
   - Restart Hydrocortisone
   - IVF PRN to maintain CVP > 12
   - F/u respiratory viral culture pending from [**2-17**]
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Resolved. 96% on RA. Remains wheezy
   with rales, but improved with diuresis
   - Continue to monitor
   # Anemia: Stable at 36.5 today. Concern for hemolysis given hapto <5,
   but no Hct has not downtrended.
   - Trend HCT
   - Guaiac all stools
   - CVP and PIV in place
   - Maintain active T/S
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), 1.7 on admission. FeNa on [**2-18**] 8.7, c/w ATN, but
   Cr improved to 1.4 today, so appears at baseline.
   - Trend BUN/Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   # Elevated LFTs: Nearly resolved. Only abnormal value is modestly
   elevated ALT to 44.
   - Trend qOD
   # Prostate CA:
   - Continue to hold Ketoconazole, but could restart if QT stable & INR
   not supratherapeutic
   - Restart steroids
   - Outpatient eval for ? sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia: PLT count 135 this AM. Mild, baseline 160-200s. DIC
   labs negative.
   - Continue to trend

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: call out with improvement in delirium, bed availability<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of atrioventricular replacement (AVR) on Coumadin, chronic heart block (CHB) pacer dependent, atrial fibrillation (Afib), and prostate cancer on hydrocortisone. He was admitted with acute onset chills and vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure, which is now resolving.

The patient is currently experiencing:

1. Delirium: The patient is agitated and has a labile affect, laughing and crying inappropriately. The delirium is thought to be multifactorial, possibly related to steroid-induced, toxic metabolic, or ICU delirium.
2. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is 5.8, which is above the therapeutic range of 2.5-3.5. This is concerning given his pacer dependence and history of atrioventricular replacement (AVR).
3. Septic Shock: The patient has resolved septic shock, which was presumably caused by a urinary source given the positive Gram-positive bacteria (GBS) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) urine cultures.
4. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress has resolved, but he remains wheezy with rales.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, but there is concern for hemolysis given his hapto <5.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure has improved, with a creatinine (Cr) level of 1.4 today, which is near baseline.
7. Elevated LFTs: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are nearly resolved, with only a modestly elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) level.
8. Prostate CA: The patient's prostate cancer is being managed with hydrocortisone, and he is awaiting outpatient evaluation for sclerotic lesions seen on computed tomography (CT) ab/pelvis.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 135, which is mildly low, but not critically low.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Increased bleeding risk due to supratherapeutic INR and possible conjunctival hemorrhage.
2. Hemolysis or hemolytic anemia due to anemia and possible hemolytic agents.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to acute renal failure and potential nephrotoxic agents.
4. Respiratory failure or distress due to continued wheezing and rales.
5. Cardiovascular complications due to atrial fibrillation and chronic heart block (CHB) pacer dependence.
6. Infection or sepsis due to positive urine cultures and possible urinary source.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to stress ulcer prophylaxis and possible gastrointestinal lesions.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Holding Coumadin and monitoring INR closely.
2. Restarting hydrocortisone and steroids.
3. Continuing to monitor delirium and adjusting medications as needed.
4. Trending hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count.
5. Avoiding nephrotoxic agents and monitoring creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels.
6. Restarting ketoconazole if QT stable and INR not supratherapeutic.
7. Outpatient evaluation for sclerotic lesions seen on CT ab/pelvis."

   contrast unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern given home steroid use.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have a cardiogenic component based on clinical exam on admission.
   Off pressors for 24 hours. Apparently had a similar bout of urosepsis
   after urologic procedure 3 years ago with very small amount of bacteria
   in urine.
   - continue broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV
   cefepime, flagyl
   - DC azithro as no evidence of pulmonary pathology

   - contact OSH [**Name (NI) **] for culture data
   # Delerium: No focal findings, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**] nature most c/w
   steroid induced vs toxic metabolic in setting of ICU stay and recent
   septic shock.
   - Stopped steroids
   - Consider holding zofran
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Pull A line and PIV
   - Call out to floor may benefit pt
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure; Resolved. 96% on RA.
   # Anemia: Consider hemolysis given hapto <5 although T bili normal and
   LD trending down, consider GI bleed.
   - Recheck hapto
   - Recheck HCT
   - Guiac all stools
   - CVP and PIV in place
   - Maintain active T/S
   # Emesis
    Resolved for now. Possibly [**1-24**] sepsis vs viral gastroenteritis. No
   evidence of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam benign. OSH
   non-contrast CT ab/pelvis unremarkable.
   - send stool, f/u other cultures
   - zofran prn
   - trand LFTs
   - OG tube pulled
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), up to 1.7 on admit. Improved to 1.3, probable
   prerenal, although ATN not ruled out.
   - f/u urine lytes, eos
   - trend creatinine
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   # AVR/CHB pacer dependent

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Imaging: CXR [**2-19**]: The patient has been extubated. Lung volumes are
   maintained and pulmonary
   edema has cleared. Moderate cardiomegaly is longstanding. There is no
   appreciable pleural effusion. Right internal jugular line tip projects
   over
   the junction of brachiocephalic veins and transvenous right atrial and
   right
   ventricular pacer leads are in standard placements.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone po presents from home with acute onset chills and
   vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.
   # Septic Shock
   Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive urine cultures with
   group B strep and e. coli. Abdominal exam benign and CT ab/pelvis w/out
   contrast unremarkable at OSH. Also AI a concern given home steroid use.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have a cardiogenic component based on clinical exam on admission.
   Off pressors for 24 hours. Apparently had a similar bout of urosepsis
   after urologic procedure 3 years ago with very small amount of bacteria
   in urine.
   - continue broad coverage for abdominal source and pneumonia with IV
   cefepime, flagyl
   - DC azithro as no evidence of pulmonary pathology
   - cont IVF to keep CVP > 12
   - wean steroids to 50mg IV Q8H
   - f/u cultures (sputum, stool, blood, urine)
   - contact OSH [**Name (NI) **] for culture data
   # Delerium: No focal findings, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**] nature most c/w
   steroid induced vs toxic metabolic in setting of ICU stay and recent
   septic shock.
   - Stopped steroids
   - Consider holding zofran
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Pull A line and PIV
   - Call out to floor may benefit pt
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure; Resolved. 96% on RA.
   # Anemia: Consider hemolysis given hapto <5 although T bili normal and
   LD trending down, consider GI bleed.
   - Recheck hapto
   - Recheck HCT
   - Guiac all stools
   - CVP and PIV in place
   - Maintain active T/S
   # Emesis
    Resolved for now. Possibly [**1-24**] sepsis vs viral gastroenteritis. No
   evidence of obstruction. LFTs underwhelming, exam benign. OSH
   non-contrast CT ab/pelvis unremarkable.
   - send stool, f/u other cultures
   - zofran prn
   - trand LFTs
   - OG tube pulled
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), up to 1.7 on admit. Improved to 1.3, probable
   prerenal, although ATN not ruled out.
   - f/u urine lytes, eos
   - trend creatinine
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   # AVR/CHB pacer dependent
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] on coumadin. INR still elevated at 6.5 (goal 2.5-3.5) no e/o
   bleed, but downtrending HCT.
   - holding coumadin in setting of elevated INR, trend closely with ABX
   regimen
   - Recheck HCT
   - check ECHO
   - CEs negative
   # Elevated LFTs
   Improving. CT at OSH unrevealing. Could be [**1-24**] shock liver.
   - trend
   # Prostate CA
   - holding ketoconazole in setting of N/V
   - po hydrocort switched to IV given shock
   - outpatient eval for ? sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia - Mild, baseline 160-200s. DIC labs negative
   - continue to trend

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's 24-hour progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Volume overload: The patient's net positive fluid balance of 600cc and new rales suggest possible volume overload, which may exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular issues.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, and the development of a conjunctival hemorrhage may be secondary to hypertension and/or elevated INR.
3. Delirium: The patient's agitated state and delirium may be multifactorial, including steroid-induced, toxic metabolic, and ICU-related factors. Stopping steroids and switching to Zyprexa may help manage this condition.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's continued dyspnea and upper airway sounds may indicate ongoing respiratory failure, which may be exacerbated by agitation or possible laryngospasm.
5. Cardiac issues: The patient's cardiomegaly on CXR and elevated INR may indicate cardiac dysfunction. The patient's CHB pacer dependence and coumadin therapy may also increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved, but ATN cannot be ruled out. Close monitoring of urine lytes and eos, as well as trending creatinine levels, is essential.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's hemolysis and elevated LDH levels may indicate GI bleeding, which could be exacerbated by the patient's steroid use and ongoing sepsis.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's mild thrombocytopenia may be related to sepsis, and close monitoring of platelet counts is necessary.
9. Sepsis: The patient's positive urine cultures and ongoing septic shock suggest a high risk of sepsis, which may lead to further organ dysfunction and failure.
10. ICU-acquired complications: The patient's prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of developing ICU-acquired complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, catheter-related bloodstream infections, and pressure ulcers.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, close monitoring and aggressive management of these potential complications are essential to prevent further deterioration and improve the patient's outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with sepsis, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. They are receiving ICU care and have been treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and diuretics. The patient's hemodynamic parameters have improved, but their INR remains substantially prolonged. The source of sepsis is unclear, and the patient has not had a positive blood culture. The patient's respiratory status is stable, and they are receiving oxygen therapy. The patient's nutritional needs are being met through parenteral nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen, leading to organ dysfunction, failure, and death.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress, leading to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and end-stage renal disease.
4. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hemodynamic parameters may continue to fluctuate, leading to hypotension, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Infection: The patient's infection may spread to other organs, leading to multi-organ dysfunction and failure.
6. Bleeding: The patient's prolonged INR may lead to bleeding complications, such as hemorrhage and hematoma.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiac status may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status may worsen, leading to encephalopathy, seizures, and coma.
9. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's gastrointestinal status may worsen, leading to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.
10. Skin and Soft Tissue Complications: The patient's skin and soft tissue may become infected, leading to cellulitis, abscesses, and sepsis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health status:

The patient is a somnolent individual with a history of respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and septic shock. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, and blood pressure of 149/72 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 96% and their respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute.

The patient has a history of IV antibiotic administration, including cefipime and metronidazole, and has been switched to oral medications. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated creatinine level.

The patient's physical examination is notable for the presence of 1-2 cm flesh-colored vesicles on the upper right extremity and over the right posterior hip. The patient's neurologic examination is normal, with the exception of the patient's inability to move or assess their tone.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, with a differential count showing a predominance of neutrophils. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 44 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 38 IU/L.

The patient has undergone imaging studies, including a computed tomography (CT) scan of the spine, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and neck, and an electroencephalogram (EEG). The results of these studies are pending.

The patient's medical history is significant for a history of allergy to morphine and nausea/vomiting.

Potential medical complications that may arise based on this information include:

1. Development of sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury and respiratory failure.
2. Progression of delirium and confusion, potentially leading to increased risk of falls, aspiration, and other complications.
3. Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and hypercoagulability.
4. Increased risk of respiratory failure due to underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other respiratory conditions.
5. Development of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or other forms of acute kidney injury due to sepsis or other factors.
6. Potential for bleeding complications due to coagulopathy or other factors.
7. Increased risk of nosocomial infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs)."

   The referring physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 11451**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] by telephone at the
   time of
   dictation.
   ECHO: [**2130-2-20**]:
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left
   ventricular function is probably normal, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is not well
   seen. There is an aortic prosthesis - which appears most likely a
   bioprosthesis. The gradient is higher than expected for this kind of
   prosthesis.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone presents from home with acute onset chills and vomiting
   followed by septic shock and respiratory failure, now resolving.
   # Delirium: No focal findings, most c/w steroid induced vs toxic
   metabolic in setting of ICU stay and recent septic shock, much improved
   today.
   - Zyprexa PRN: agitation
   - Restarted home steroids yesterday (hydrocortisone 10 mg q AM, 20 q
   PM)
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Pulled A-line, D/C foley once good diuresis acheieved and no longer
   in need of close UOP monitoring.
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Patient pacer dependent s/p AVR with St. Jude
   valve on Coumadin. INR still supratherapeutic at 5.8 (goal 2.5-3.5)
   with e/o of conjunctival hemorrhage, but stable HCT.
   - Continue to hold Coumadin
   - Monitor closely for visual changes and other sources of bleeding
   - Daily HCT
   - Will need to monitor coumadin dosing closely if ketoconazole is
   restarted on d/c.
   # Septic Shock: Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive GBS
   & E. coli urine cultures; possibly PNA with CXR with ?of consolidation
   at admission. Now afebrile, downtrending WBC, CXR with pulm edema but
   no e/o PNA. Patient w/ h/o urosepsis after urologic procedure ~ 3 years
   ago.
   - Continue Cepodoxime, day [**4-1**]
   - Restarted Hydrocortisone [**2130-2-20**].
   - Respiratory viral culture negative.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**] course.  Has periods
   throughout the day of respiratory distress, likely secondary to
   pulmonary edema from underlying diastolic dysfunction. Now 96% on RA.
   Remains wheezy with crackles, but improves with diuresis.
   - More aggressive diuresis with Lasix, closely monitoring lytes.
   - goal 2L diuresis or until respiratory improvement.
   - Closely monitor blood pressure, may warrant going up on BP meds
   .
   # Anemia: Stable at 36.1 today. Initially, concern for hemolysis given
   hapto <5, but Hct has not downtrended.
   - Trend HCT
   - Guaiac all stools
   - PIV in place, active T/S
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), 1.7 on admission. FeNa on [**2-18**] 8.7, c/w ATN, but
   Cr improved to 1.5  today, so appears at baseline.  [**Month (only) 60**] improve with
   diuresis.
   - Trend BUN/Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   # Elevated LFTs: Nearly resolved. Only abnormal value [**2130-2-20**] was
   modestly elevated ALT to 44.
   - Trend qOD
   # Prostate CA:
   - PSA [**2130-2-20**] 95.2, 56.4 on [**2130-1-26**]
   - Continue to hold Ketoconazole, but could restart if QT stable & INR
   not supratherapeutic
   - Restarted steroids
   - Outpatient eval for ?sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia: PLT count 135 this AM. Mild, baseline 160-200s. DIC
   labs negative.
   - Continue to trend, improving.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and prostate cancer (PCA) on hydrocortisone. He presents with acute onset chills and vomiting, followed by septic shock and respiratory failure.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* He is still somnolent and has been started on cefpodoxime for suspected urinary tract infection (UTI).
* His central line was removed and replaced with peripheral lines.
* He has been restarted on hydrocortisone and is being closely monitored for signs of adrenal insufficiency.
* His INR is still supratherapeutic, and Coumadin is being held.
* He has improved respiratory distress, but still has periods of wheezing and crackles, likely secondary to pulmonary edema.
* His anemia is stable, and his acute renal failure (ARF) has improved with diuresis.
* His elevated liver function tests (LFTs) are nearly resolved.
* His prostate cancer is being monitored with regular PSA checks.
* He has mild thrombocytopenia, which is improving.
* He has weakness and neuromuscular issues, which are being monitored and may require a neurology consultation.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's supratherapeutic INR and Coumadin hold may increase the risk of bleeding, and his aortic prosthesis may be at risk of thrombosis.
* Infection: The patient's UTI may progress to sepsis, and his central line removal may have introduced bacteria into his bloodstream.
* Renal failure: The patient's ARF may worsen, requiring dialysis.
* Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's hydrocortisone restart may lead to adrenal crisis if not monitored closely.
* Neurological complications: The patient's weakness and neuromuscular issues may worsen, requiring a neurology consultation and possible intervention.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Close monitoring of his respiratory status and INR.
* Continued diuresis and monitoring of his renal function.
* Closely monitoring his adrenal function and restarting hydrocortisone as needed.
* Monitoring his platelet count and bleeding risk.
* Considering a neurology consultation for his weakness and neuromuscular issues.
* Restarting ketoconazole if his QT is stable and INR is not supratherapeutic.
* Outpatient evaluation for sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis."

   IMAGING: CXR [**2130-2-20**]
   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, there are now
   classically
   signs of moderate pulmonary edema. No evidence of focal parenchymal
   opacities
   suggesting pneumonia. No pleural effusions. Borderline size of the
   cardiac
   silhouette. The monitoring and support devices are in unchanged
   position.
   The referring physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 11451**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] by telephone at the
   time of
   dictation.
   ECHO: [**2130-2-20**]:
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left
   ventricular function is probably normal, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is not well
   seen. There is an aortic prosthesis - which appears most likely a
   bioprosthesis. The gradient is higher than expected for this kind of
   prosthesis.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone presents from home with acute onset chills and vomiting
   followed by septic shock and respiratory failure, now resolving.
   # Delirium: No focal findings, most c/w steroid induced vs toxic
   metabolic in setting of ICU stay and recent septic shock.
   - Zyprexa PRN: agitation
   - Restarted home steroids yesterday (hydrocortisone 10 mg q AM, 20 q
   PM)
   - Consider holding zofran
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Pulled A-line.
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Patient pacer dependent s/p AVR with St. Jude
   valve on Coumadin. INR still supratherapeutic at 5.8 (goal 2.5-3.5)
   with e/o of conjunctival hemorrhage, but stable HCT.
   - Continue to hold Coumadin
   - Monitor closely for visual changes and other sources of bleeding
   - Daily HCT
   - F/U ECHO to evaluate EF/? New wall motion abnormality
   # Septic Shock: Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive GBS
   & E. coli urine cultures. Afebrile, downtrending WBC, not requiring
   pressors. Unconcerning abdominal imaging at OSH. Patient w/ h/o
   urosepsis after urologic procedure ~ 3 years ago.
   - D/C IV Cefepime, Flagyl & started Cepodoxime, day [**3-1**]
   - Restarted Hydrocortisone
   - Respiratory viral culture negative
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Resolved. 96% on RA. Remains wheezy
   with crackles, but improved with diuresis
   - Continue to monitor
   # Anemia: Stable at 36.1 today. Concern for hemolysis given hapto <5,
   but Hct has not downtrended.
   - Trend HCT
   - Guaiac all stools
   - CVP and PIV in place
   - Maintain active T/S
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), 1.7 on admission. FeNa on [**2-18**] 8.7, c/w ATN, but
   Cr improved to 1.5  today, so appears at baseline.
   - Trend BUN/Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   # Elevated LFTs: Nearly resolved. Only abnormal value [**2130-2-20**] was
   modestly elevated ALT to 44.
   - Trend qOD
   # Prostate CA:
   - PSA [**2130-2-20**] 95.2, 56.4 on [**2130-1-26**]
   - Continue to hold Ketoconazole, but could restart if QT stable & INR
   not supratherapeutic
   - Restarted steroids
   - Outpatient eval for ? sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia: PLT count 135 this AM. Mild, baseline 160-200s. DIC
   labs negative.
   - Continue to trend, improving.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   signs of moderate pulmonary edema. No evidence of focal parenchymal
   opacities
   suggesting pneumonia. No pleural effusions. Borderline size of the
   cardiac

   position.
   The referring physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 11451**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] by telephone at the
   time of
   dictation.
   ECHO: [**2130-2-20**]:
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left
   ventricular function is probably normal, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is not well
   seen. There is an aortic prosthesis - which appears most likely a
   bioprosthesis. The gradient is higher than expected for this kind of
   prosthesis.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone presents from home with acute onset chills and vomiting
   followed by septic shock and respiratory failure, now resolving.
   # Delirium: No focal findings, most c/w steroid induced vs toxic
   metabolic in setting of ICU stay and recent septic shock.
   - Zyprexa PRN: agitation
   - Restarted home steroids yesterday (hydrocortisone 10 mg q AM, 20 q
   PM)
   - Consider holding zofran
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Pulled A-line.
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Patient pacer dependent s/p AVR with St. Jude
   valve on Coumadin. INR still supratherapeutic at 5.8 (goal 2.5-3.5)
   with e/o of conjunctival hemorrhage, but stable HCT.
   - Continue to hold Coumadin
   - Monitor closely for visual changes and other sources of bleeding
   - Daily HCT
   - F/U ECHO to evaluate EF/? New wall motion abnormality
   # Septic Shock: Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive GBS
   & E. coli urine cultures. Afebrile, downtrending WBC, not requiring
   pressors. Unconcerning abdominal imaging at OSH. Patient w/ h/o
   urosepsis after urologic procedure ~ 3 years ago.
   - D/C IV Cefepime, Flagyl & started Cepodoxime, day [**3-1**]
   - Restarted Hydrocortisone
   - Respiratory viral culture negative
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Resolved. 96% on RA. Remains wheezy
   with crackles, but improved with diuresis
   - Continue to monitor
   # Anemia: Stable at 36.1 today. Concern for hemolysis given hapto <5,
   but Hct has not downtrended.
   - Trend HCT
   - Guaiac all stools
   - CVP and PIV in place
   - Maintain active T/S
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), 1.7 on admission. FeNa on [**2-18**] 8.7, c/w ATN, but
   Cr improved to 1.5  today, so appears at baseline.
   - Trend BUN/Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   # Elevated LFTs: Nearly resolved. Only abnormal value [**2130-2-20**] was
   modestly elevated ALT to 44.
   - Trend qOD
   # Prostate CA:
   - PSA [**2130-2-20**] 95.2, 56.4 on [**2130-1-26**]
   - Continue to hold Ketoconazole, but could restart if QT stable & INR
   not supratherapeutic
   - Restarted steroids
   - Outpatient eval for ? sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia: PLT count 135 this AM. Mild, baseline 160-200s. DIC
   labs negative.
   - Continue to trend, improving.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and prostate cancer, who was admitted to the ICU with acute onset chills and vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. He has undergone an aortic valve replacement (AVR) and is pacer-dependent. The patient's condition has been improving, with resolution of septic shock, hypoxic respiratory distress, and anemia.

Current medications include:

* Hydrocortisone 10 mg q AM, 20 mg q PM
* Cepodoxime
* Lasix
* Furosemide
* Zyprexa (PRN)
* Coumadin (held due to supratherapeutic INR)

Laboratory results show:

* Elevated INR (5.8) with stable HCT
* Supratherapeutic potassium levels (3.1)
* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT 44)
* Mild thrombocytopenia (PLT count 135)
* Elevated creatinine levels (1.7) with improvement to 1.5
* Elevated lactate levels (0.9 mmol/L)

Imaging studies show:

* Classically signs of moderate pulmonary edema on CXR
* Poor technical quality on ECHO due to patient's body habitus
* Aortic prosthesis (bioprosthesis) with higher than expected gradient

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding: The patient's supratherapeutic INR and Coumadin therapy may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of a pacer-dependent patient.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's mild thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly if the platelet count continues to decline.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and supratherapeutic potassium levels may indicate acute kidney injury, which could worsen if not managed promptly.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and ongoing respiratory symptoms may increase the risk of respiratory failure, particularly if the patient's lung function continues to decline.
5. Delirium: The patient's ongoing delirium may increase the risk of falls, respiratory failure, and other complications if not managed promptly.
6. Infection: The patient's history of septic shock and ongoing respiratory symptoms may increase the risk of infection, particularly if the patient's immune system is compromised.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, particularly if the patient's cardiac function continues to decline.

In conclusion, the patient's condition has been improving, but ongoing medical complications may arise if not managed promptly. Close monitoring of the patient's laboratory results, imaging studies, and clinical status is essential to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   IMAGING: CXR [**2130-2-20**]
   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, there are now
   classically
   signs of moderate pulmonary edema. No evidence of focal parenchymal
   opacities
   suggesting pneumonia. No pleural effusions. Borderline size of the
   cardiac
   silhouette. The monitoring and support devices are in unchanged
   position.
   The referring physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 11451**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] by telephone at the
   time of
   dictation.
   ECHO: [**2130-2-20**]:
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left
   ventricular function is probably normal, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is not well
   seen. There is an aortic prosthesis - which appears most likely a
   bioprosthesis. The gradient is higher than expected for this kind of
   prosthesis.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone presents from home with acute onset chills and vomiting
   followed by septic shock and respiratory failure, now resolving.
   # Delirium: No focal findings, most c/w steroid induced vs toxic
   metabolic in setting of ICU stay and recent septic shock.
   - Zyprexa PRN: agitation
   - Restarted home steroids yesterday (hydrocortisone 10 mg q AM, 20 q
   PM)
   - Consider holding zofran
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Pulled A-line.
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Patient pacer dependent s/p AVR with St. Jude
   valve on Coumadin. INR still supratherapeutic at 5.8 (goal 2.5-3.5)
   with e/o of conjunctival hemorrhage, but stable HCT.
   - Continue to hold Coumadin
   - Monitor closely for visual changes and other sources of bleeding
   - Daily HCT
   - F/U ECHO to evaluate EF/? New wall motion abnormality
   # Septic Shock: Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive GBS
   & E. coli urine cultures. Afebrile, downtrending WBC, not requiring
   pressors. Unconcerning abdominal imaging at OSH. Patient w/ h/o
   urosepsis after urologic procedure ~ 3 years ago.
   - D/C IV Cefepime, Flagyl & started Cepodoxime, day [**3-1**]
   - Restarted Hydrocortisone
   - Respiratory viral culture negative
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Resolved. 96% on RA. Remains wheezy
   with crackles, but improved with diuresis
   - Continue to monitor
   # Anemia: Stable at 36.1 today. Concern for hemolysis given hapto <5,
   but Hct has not downtrended.
   - Trend HCT
   - Guaiac all stools
   - CVP and PIV in place
   - Maintain active T/S
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), 1.7 on admission. FeNa on [**2-18**] 8.7, c/w ATN, but
   Cr improved to 1.5  today, so appears at baseline.
   - Trend BUN/Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   # Elevated LFTs: Nearly resolved. Only abnormal value [**2130-2-20**] was
   modestly elevated ALT to 44.
   - Trend qOD
   # Prostate CA:
   - PSA [**2130-2-20**] 95.2, 56.4 on [**2130-1-26**]
   - Continue to hold Ketoconazole, but could restart if QT stable & INR
   not supratherapeutic
   - Restarted steroids
   - Outpatient eval for ? sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia: PLT count 135 this AM. Mild, baseline 160-200s. DIC
   labs negative.
   - Continue to trend, improving.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Delirium: The patient is at risk for delirium due to the prolonged ICU stay, recent septic shock, and steroid use. The patient's mental status should be closely monitored, and frequent reorientation is recommended.
2. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is still supratherapeutic at 5.8, which is a risk factor for bleeding. The patient's Coumadin should be continued to be held, and close monitoring for visual changes and other sources of bleeding is recommended.
3. Septic Shock: Although the patient's septic shock has resolved, the patient is still at risk for recurrent septicemia due to the positive urine cultures. The patient's urine output should be closely monitored, and further evaluation of the urinary tract is recommended.
4. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and the patient should be continued on oxygen therapy as needed.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia should be closely monitored, and the patient should be evaluated for potential causes such as hemolysis or gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and the patient should be evaluated for potential causes such as nephrotoxic medications or underlying kidney disease.
7. Elevated LFTs: The patient's liver function tests should be closely monitored, and the patient should be evaluated for potential causes such as medication toxicity or underlying liver disease.
8. Prostate CA: The patient's prostate cancer should be closely monitored, and the patient should be evaluated for potential complications such as bone metastases or spinal cord compression.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count should be closely monitored, and the patient should be evaluated for potential causes such as medication toxicity or underlying bone marrow disease.

In terms of the patient's overall condition, the patient is at risk for further complications due to their prolonged ICU stay, recent septic shock, and underlying medical conditions. Close monitoring and prompt evaluation of any changes in the patient's condition are recommended."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone presents from home with acute onset chills and vomiting
   followed by septic shock and respiratory failure, now resolving.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Improved with >2.5L diuresis yesterday,
   now length of stay negative. Currently 99-100% on RA during the day, 2L
   by NC overnight for comfort.  Patient
s breathing unlabored sitting up,
   but remains mildly wheezy with crackles when lying flat.
   - Lasix 40mg PO daily with 40mg IV Lasix PRN, with close eye to renal
   function
   - Wean O2 as tolerates
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Patient pacer dependent s/p AVR with St. Jude
   valve on Coumadin. INR still supratherapeutic at 5.9 (goal 2.5-3.5)
   with e/o of conjunctival hemorrhage, but stable HCT.
   - Continue to hold Coumadin
   - Monitor closely for visual changes and other sources of bleeding
   - Daily HCT
   - Monitor Coumadin dosing closely if ketoconazole is restarted on d/c.
   # Hypertension: Patient with elevated sbp
s yesterday despite diuresis
   on home antihypertensives, in the setting of restarting home steroids.
   Will require good bp control given diastolic heart failure and tendency
   for pulmonary edema.
   - Continue Lisinopril 40mg PO daily
   - Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5mg PO BID
   - Consider increasing Metoprolol to 25mg PO BID (given patient is
   paced)
   # Diarrhea: Patient with infrequent watery diarrhea over past 2 days.
   C. diff screen negative, C. jejuni pending. [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to
   medication/diet. Remains afebrile with normal WBC.
   - F/U C. jejuni
   - If culture negative, can give Loperamide PRN for comfort
   # Septic Shock: Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive GBS
   & E. coli urine cultures; possibly PNA with CXR with ?of consolidation
   at admission. Now afebrile, downtrending WBC, CXR with pulm edema but
   no e/o PNA. Patient w/ h/o urosepsis after urologic procedure ~ 3 years
   ago.
   - Continue Cepodoxime, day [**5-1**]
   - Continue Hydrocortisone
   # Delirium: Improved despite restarting home steroids on [**2-19**]. Prior
   delirium likely multifactorial in context of septic shock, ICU stay,
   and steroids.
   - Zyprexa PRN: agitation
   - Continue home Hydrocortisone 10 mg q AM, 20 q PM
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Consider D/C
ing Foley today
   # Anemia: Stable over past 24 hours. Hct 39.0 today. Low haptoglobin on
   admission suggested infection driven hemolysis, but appears to have
   resolved with treatment of infection.
   - Trend HCT
   - Guaiac all stools
   - PIV in place, active T/S
   # Acute Renal Failure:
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), 1.7 on admission, today rose to 1.7 after
   aggressive diuresis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of atrioventricular replacement (AVR) on coumadin, chronic heart failure (CHF), and prostate cancer on hydrocortisone, who presented to the ICU with acute onset chills and vomiting followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. He is currently recovering and has been treated with antibiotics, diuresis, and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertension: The patient's systolic blood pressure is elevated, and he is taking home antihypertensives. He also has diastolic heart failure and a tendency for pulmonary edema, which requires good blood pressure control.
2. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is supratherapeutic at 5.9, which may increase the risk of bleeding. He is taking coumadin, which should be continued to be monitored closely.
3. Diarrhea: The patient has had infrequent watery diarrhea over the past two days, and C. difficile (C. diff) and C. jejuni cultures are pending. If the cultures are negative, loperamide may be used for comfort.
4. Septic Shock: The patient has had septic shock, which has resolved. However, he still has a urinary source of infection, and his white blood cell count is downtrending.
5. Delirium: The patient has had delirium, which has improved despite restarting home steroids. He is taking Zyprexa PRN for agitation and is being frequently reoriented.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is stable, but his haptoglobin level on admission suggested infection-driven hemolysis, which has resolved with treatment of the infection.
7. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has risen to 1.7 after aggressive diuresis. He should be closely monitored for acute renal failure, and nephrotoxic agents should be avoided.
8. Prostate Cancer: The patient has prostate cancer, and his PSA level has risen. He is taking home steroids and will restart ketoconazole if his QT interval is stable and his INR is not supratherapeutic.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has resolved, but he should be closely monitored for any changes.
10. Weakness/Neuromuscular Issue: The patient has had weakness and difficulty with ambulation, movement, and getting up from a seated position since his hip fracture six years ago. He may benefit from physical therapy and getting out of bed.

ICU Care:

* Nutrition: Regular, low-sodium, lactose-free
* Glycemic Control: Insulin sliding scale (ISS) for glucose control while on steroids
* Lines: 20-gauge line inserted on February 20
* Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis with supratherapeutic INR, holding Coumadin; stress ulcer prophylaxis with H2 blocker
* VAP: None
* Comments: The patient and his wife have been communicated with, and his status is full code."

   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone presents from home with acute onset chills and vomiting
   followed by septic shock and respiratory failure, now resolving.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Improved with >2.5L diuresis yesterday,
   now length of stay negative. Currently 99-100% on RA during the day, 2L
   by NC overnight for comfort.  Patient
s breathing unlabored sitting up,
   but remains mildly wheezy with crackles when lying flat.
   - Lasix 40mg PO daily with 40mg IV Lasix PRN, with close eye to renal
   function
   - Wean O2 as tolerates
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Patient pacer dependent s/p AVR with St. Jude
   valve on Coumadin. INR still supratherapeutic at 5.9 (goal 2.5-3.5)
   with e/o of conjunctival hemorrhage, but stable HCT.
   - Continue to hold Coumadin
   - Monitor closely for visual changes and other sources of bleeding
   - Daily HCT
   - Monitor Coumadin dosing closely if ketoconazole is restarted on d/c.
   # Hypertension: Patient with elevated sbp
s yesterday despite diuresis
   on home antihypertensives, in the setting of restarting home steroids.
   Will require good bp control given diastolic heart failure and tendency
   for pulmonary edema.
   - Continue Lisinopril 40mg PO daily
   - Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5mg PO BID
   - Consider increasing Metoprolol to 25mg PO BID (given patient is
   paced)
   # Diarrhea: Patient with infrequent watery diarrhea over past 2 days.
   C. diff screen negative, C. jejuni pending. [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to
   medication/diet. Remains afebrile with normal WBC.
   - F/U C. jejuni
   - If culture negative, can give Loperamide PRN for comfort
   # Septic Shock: Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive GBS
   & E. coli urine cultures; possibly PNA with CXR with ?of consolidation
   at admission. Now afebrile, downtrending WBC, CXR with pulm edema but
   no e/o PNA. Patient w/ h/o urosepsis after urologic procedure ~ 3 years
   ago.
   - Continue Cepodoxime, day [**5-1**]
   - Continue Hydrocortisone
   # Delirium: Improved despite restarting home steroids on [**2-19**]. Prior
   delirium likely multifactorial in context of septic shock, ICU stay,
   and steroids.
   - Zyprexa PRN: agitation
   - Continue home Hydrocortisone 10 mg q AM, 20 q PM
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Consider D/C
ing Foley today
   # Anemia: Stable over past 24 hours. Hct 39.0 today. Low haptoglobin on
   admission suggested infection driven hemolysis, but appears to have
   resolved with treatment of infection.
   - Trend HCT
   - Guaiac all stools
   - PIV in place, active T/S
   # Acute Renal Failure:
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), 1.7 on admission, today rose to 1.7 after
   aggressive diuresis.
   - Trend BUN/Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - Minimize additional diuresis if possible
   # Prostate CA:
   - PSA [**2130-2-20**] 95.2, 56.4 on [**2130-1-26**]
   - Continue to hold Ketoconazole, but will restart if QT stable & INR
   not supratherapeutic
   - Continue home steroids
   - Outpatient eval for ?sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia: Resolved. PLT count 158 this AM. At baseline of
   160-200s. DIC labs negative.

   # Weakness/?Neuromuscular issue: Patient at baseline able to walk at
   home, climb stairs holding railing, get up from seated position, per
   wife.  [**Name (NI) 59**] acute change in his baseline functioning prior to admission.
   Would benefit from PT and getting OOB.  If not at baseline per family,
   can consider neurology consult.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of atrioventricular replacement, chronic heart failure, and prostate cancer on hydrocortisone. He was admitted to the ICU with acute onset chills and vomiting, followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient has improved significantly, with resolution of septic shock and respiratory failure. However, he still has several ongoing issues, including hypertension, supratherapeutic INR, diarrhea, anemia, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and weakness/neuromuscular issues.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, and he is at risk for further complications, such as cardiac failure and pulmonary edema.
2. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is still elevated, and he is at risk for bleeding complications, including conjunctival hemorrhage.
3. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea is ongoing, and he is at risk for dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is ongoing, and he is at risk for further complications, including heart failure and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is ongoing, and he is at risk for further complications, including chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia has resolved, but he is at risk for further complications, including bleeding and bruising.
7. Weakness/Neuromuscular Issues: The patient's weakness and neuromuscular issues are ongoing, and he is at risk for further complications, including falls and decreased mobility.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust his antihypertensive medications as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's INR and adjust his Coumadin dosing as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's diarrhea and adjust his treatment plan as needed.

   hydrocortisone presents from home with acute onset chills and vomiting
   followed by septic shock and respiratory failure, now resolving.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Improved with diuresis yesterday, now
   length of stay negative. Now 99-100% on RA during the day, 2L
   overnight. Remains wheezy with crackles.
   - More aggressive diuresis with Lasix, closely monitoring lytes.
   - goal 2L diuresis or until respiratory improvement.
   - Closely monitor blood pressure, may warrant going up on BP meds
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Patient pacer dependent s/p AVR with St. Jude
   valve on Coumadin. INR still supratherapeutic at 5.9 (goal 2.5-3.5)
   with e/o of conjunctival hemorrhage, but stable HCT.
   - Continue to hold Coumadin
   - Monitor closely for visual changes and other sources of bleeding
   - Daily HCT
   - Monitor Coumadin dosing closely if ketoconazole is restarted on d/c.
   # Septic Shock: Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive GBS
   & E. coli urine cultures; possibly PNA with CXR with ?of consolidation
   at admission. Now afebrile, downtrending WBC, CXR with pulm edema but
   no e/o PNA. Patient w/ h/o urosepsis after urologic procedure ~ 3 years
   ago.
   - Continue Cepodoxime, day [**4-1**]
   - Restarted Hydrocortisone [**2130-2-20**].
   - Respiratory viral culture negative.
   # Delirium: No focal findings, most c/w steroid induced vs toxic
   metabolic in setting of ICU stay and recent septic shock, much improved
   today.
   - Zyprexa PRN: agitation
   - Restarted home steroids yesterday (hydrocortisone 10 mg q AM, 20 q
   PM)
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Pulled A-line, D/C foley once good diuresis acheieved and no longer
   in need of close UOP monitoring.
   # Anemia: Stable at 36.1 today. Initially, concern for hemolysis given
   hapto <5, but Hct has not downtrended.
   - Trend HCT
   - Guaiac all stools
   - PIV in place, active T/S
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), 1.7 on admission. FeNa on [**2-18**] 8.7, c/w ATN, but

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of atrioventricular replacement (AVR) on coumadin, chronic heart failure (CHF), and prostate cancer, who was admitted to the ICU with acute onset chills, vomiting, and septic shock. He is currently on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and oxygen saturation of 100%. His blood pressure is stable, and he has improved from septic shock. His laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating cardiac damage. He has also developed acute renal failure, which has improved with diuresis. His electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated potassium level. His hemoglobin level is 13.6 g/dL, and his platelet count is 158 K/uL. He has a history of prostate cancer and is taking hydrocortisone for treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia has improved with antibiotics and diuresis, but there is still a risk of complications such as respiratory failure, septic shock, and death.
2. Septic Shock: Although the patient has improved from septic shock, there is still a risk of recurrence due to the underlying condition and the presence of bacteria in his urine.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure has improved with diuresis, but there is still a risk of chronic kidney disease and the need for dialysis.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac condition is stable, but there is still a risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status is stable, but there is still a risk of neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, and spinal cord injury.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's gastrointestinal status is stable, but there is still a risk of gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
7. Hematological Complications: The patient's hematological status is stable, but there is still a risk of hematological complications such as anemia, bleeding, and thrombocytopenia.
8. Infectious Complications: The patient is at risk of developing infectious complications such as pneumonia, sepsis, and urinary tract infections due to his underlying condition and the presence of bacteria in his urine.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medical condition closely to detect any changes or complications early.
2. Continue to provide respiratory support with a nasal cannula and oxygen saturation of 100%.
3. Continue to manage the patient's blood pressure with medication and close monitoring.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his medication as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's hemoglobin level and adjust his transfusion therapy as necessary.
6. Consider referring the patient to a neurologist or cardiologist for further evaluation and management of his condition.
7. Consider referring the patient to a physical therapist for rehabilitation and management of his weakness and mobility issues.
8. Consider referring the patient to a dietician for nutrition counseling and management of his gastrointestinal status."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone presents from home with acute onset chills and vomiting
   followed by septic shock and respiratory failure, now resolving.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Improved with >2.5L diuresis yesterday,
   now length of stay negative. Currently 99-100% on RA during the day, 2L
   by NC overnight for comfort.  Patient
s breathing unlabored sitting up,
   but remains mildly wheezy with crackles when lying flat.
   - Lasix 40mg PO daily with 40mg IV Lasix PRN, with close eye to renal
   function
   - Wean O2 as tolerates
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Patient pacer dependent s/p AVR with St. Jude
   valve on Coumadin. INR still supratherapeutic at 5.9 (goal 2.5-3.5)
   with e/o of conjunctival hemorrhage, but stable HCT.
   - Continue to hold Coumadin
   - Monitor closely for visual changes and other sources of bleeding
   - Daily HCT
   - Monitor Coumadin dosing closely if ketoconazole is restarted on d/c.
   # Hypertension: Patient with elevated sbp
s yesterday despite diuresis
   on home antihypertensives, in the setting of restarting home steroids.
   Will require good bp control given diastolic heart failure and tendency
   for pulmonary edema.
   - Continue Lisinopril 40mg PO daily
   - Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5mg PO BID
   - Consider increasing Metoprolol to 25mg PO BID (given patient is
   paced)
   # Diarrhea: Patient with infrequent watery diarrhea over past 2 days.
   C. diff screen negative, C. jejuni pending. [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to
   medication/diet. Remains afebrile with normal WBC.
   - F/U C. jejuni
   - If culture negative, can give Loperamide PRN for comfort
   # Septic Shock: Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive GBS
   & E. coli urine cultures; possibly PNA with CXR with ?of consolidation
   at admission. Now afebrile, downtrending WBC, CXR with pulm edema but
   no e/o PNA. Patient w/ h/o urosepsis after urologic procedure ~ 3 years
   ago.
   - Continue Cepodoxime, day [**5-1**]
   - Continue Hydrocortisone
   # Delirium: Improved despite restarting home steroids on [**2-19**]. Prior
   delirium likely multifactorial in context of septic shock, ICU stay,
   and steroids.
   - Zyprexa PRN: agitation
   - Continue home Hydrocortisone 10 mg q AM, 20 q PM
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Consider D/C
ing Foley today
   # Anemia: Stable over past 24 hours. Hct 39.0 today. Low haptoglobin on
   admission suggested infection driven hemolysis, but appears to have
   resolved with treatment of infection.
   - Trend HCT
   - Guaiac all stools
   - PIV in place, active T/S
   # Acute Renal Failure:
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), 1.7 on admission, today rose to 1.7 after
   aggressive diuresis.
   - Trend BUN/Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - Minimize additional diuresis if possible
   # Prostate CA:
   - PSA [**2130-2-20**] 95.2, 56.4 on [**2130-1-26**]
   - Continue to hold Ketoconazole, but will restart if QT stable & INR
   not supratherapeutic
   - Continue home steroids
   - Outpatient eval for ?sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia: Resolved. PLT count 158 this AM. At baseline of
   160-200s. DIC labs negative.
   - Continue to trend
   # Weakness/?Neuromuscular issue: Patient at baseline able to walk at
   home, climb stairs holding railing, get up from seated position, per
   wife.  [**Name (NI) 59**] acute change in his baseline functioning prior to admission.
   Would benefit from PT and getting OOB.  If not at baseline per family,
   can consider neurology consult.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone presents from home with acute onset chills and vomiting
   followed by septic shock and respiratory failure, now resolving.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Improved with >2.5L diuresis yesterday,
   now length of stay negative. Currently 99-100% on RA during the day, 2L
   by NC overnight for comfort.  Patient
s breathing unlabored sitting up,
   but remains mildly wheezy with crackles when lying flat.
   - Lasix 40mg PO daily with 40mg IV Lasix PRN, with close eye to renal
   function
   - Wean O2 as tolerates
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Patient pacer dependent s/p AVR with St. Jude
   valve on Coumadin. INR still supratherapeutic at 5.9 (goal 2.5-3.5)
   with e/o of conjunctival hemorrhage, but stable HCT.
   - Continue to hold Coumadin
   - Monitor closely for visual changes and other sources of bleeding
   - Daily HCT
   - Monitor Coumadin dosing closely if ketoconazole is restarted on d/c.
   # Hypertension: Patient with elevated sbp
s yesterday despite diuresis
   on home antihypertensives, in the setting of restarting home steroids.
   Will require good bp control given diastolic heart failure and tendency
   for pulmonary edema.
   - Continue Lisinopril 40mg PO daily
   - Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5mg PO BID
   - Consider increasing Metoprolol to 25mg PO BID (given patient is
   paced)
   # Diarrhea: Patient with infrequent watery diarrhea over past 2 days.
   C. diff screen negative, C. jejuni pending. [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to
   medication/diet. Remains afebrile with normal WBC.
   - F/U C. jejuni
   - If culture negative, can give Loperamide PRN for comfort
   # Septic Shock: Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive GBS
   & E. coli urine cultures; possibly PNA with CXR with ?of consolidation
   at admission. Now afebrile, downtrending WBC, CXR with pulm edema but
   no e/o PNA. Patient w/ h/o urosepsis after urologic procedure ~ 3 years
   ago.
   - Continue Cepodoxime, day [**5-1**]
   - Continue Hydrocortisone
   # Delirium: Improved despite restarting home steroids on [**2-19**]. Prior
   delirium likely multifactorial in context of septic shock, ICU stay,
   and steroids.
   - Zyprexa PRN: agitation
   - Continue home Hydrocortisone 10 mg q AM, 20 q PM
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Consider D/C
ing Foley today
   # Anemia: Stable over past 24 hours. Hct 39.0 today. Low haptoglobin on
   admission suggested infection driven hemolysis, but appears to have
   resolved with treatment of infection.
   - Trend HCT
   - Guaiac all stools
   - PIV in place, active T/S
   # Acute Renal Failure:
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), 1.7 on admission, today rose to 1.7 after
   aggressive diuresis.
   - Trend BUN/Cr

   - Minimize additional diuresis if possible
   # Prostate CA:
   - PSA [**2130-2-20**] 95.2, 56.4 on [**2130-1-26**]
   - Continue to hold Ketoconazole, but will restart if QT stable & INR
   not supratherapeutic
   - Continue home steroids
   - Outpatient eval for ?sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia: Resolved. PLT count 158 this AM. At baseline of

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, respiratory failure, and acute onset chills and vomiting. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and prostate cancer. He is dependent on a cardiac pacemaker and is taking Coumadin for atrial fibrillation. The patient has a supratherapeutic INR (5.9) and is at risk for bleeding. He also has hypertension, anemia, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a length of stay negative. He is receiving diuresis and is being closely monitored for renal function. His INR is being closely monitored, and Coumadin is being held due to the supratherapeutic level. He is also receiving hydrocortisone for septic shock and is being closely monitored for signs of bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's supratherapeutic INR (5.9) puts him at risk for bleeding. He is being closely monitored for signs of bleeding, and Coumadin is being held.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is being closely monitored, and diuresis is being used to manage his fluid status.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is being closely monitored, and his antihypertensive medications are being adjusted as needed.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is being closely monitored, and his hemoglobin levels are being trended.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia has resolved, but he is being closely monitored for any signs of bleeding or platelet dysfunction.
6. Weakness/Neuromuscular Issue: The patient's weakness and neuromuscular issue are being closely monitored, and he is being considered for physical therapy and occupational therapy to improve his functional status.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's INR and adjust Coumadin as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust diuresis as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's hypertension and adjust his antihypertensive medications as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust his hemoglobin levels as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's thrombocytopenia and adjust his platelet levels as needed.
6. Consider physical therapy and occupational therapy to improve the patient's functional status.
7. Consider a neurology consult if the patient's weakness and neuromuscular issue do not improve with physical therapy and occupational therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90 kg male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia. He has a history of hip fracture 6 years ago, which led to weakness and difficulty with ambulation. His wife reports no acute worsening of muscle strength or weakness. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics, diuretics, and other medications. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, and blood pressure of 130/67 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 100%. His respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's blood pressure is fluctuating, and his creatinine level has risen to 1.7 mg/dL, indicating possible septic shock.
2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula oxygen therapy, indicating possible acute respiratory failure.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has risen to 1.7 mg/dL, indicating possible acute renal failure.
4. Delirium and confusion: The patient's mental status is compromised, as evidenced by his inability to respond to assessment of neuromuscular function.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is not improving, as evidenced by the lack of change in his vital signs and laboratory results.
6. Pressure ulcers: The patient's skin was not assessed, increasing the risk of pressure ulcers.
7. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to his immobility and the use of central lines.
8. VAP: The patient is at risk for VAP due to his mechanical ventilation and the use of endotracheal tubes.
9. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to his critical illness and the use of corticosteroids.
10. Infection: The patient's C. diff and C. jejuni cultures are pending, and he may have an underlying infection that is not yet identified.

These potential medical complications require close monitoring and prompt treatment to prevent further deterioration of the patient's condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia. He has a history of hip fracture and has been experiencing weakness with ambulation and movement since 6 years ago. He has had one fall in the past month. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 130/67 to 161/92 mmHg, and a heart rate of 61 beats per minute. He is receiving antibiotics and is being closely monitored for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia may progress to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's blood pressure fluctuations and tachycardia may indicate underlying cardiovascular issues, such as hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's history of weakness and falls may indicate a neurological disorder, such as Parkinson's disease or peripheral neuropathy. The lack of assessment of neuromuscular function and tone may indicate a need for further evaluation.
4. Infection complications: The patient's pneumonia may lead to secondary infections, such as sepsis or septic shock, if not properly treated.
5. Fluid and electrolyte imbalances: The patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels may indicate underlying issues, such as dehydration or electrolyte deficiencies, which may require further evaluation and management.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of falls and weakness may indicate underlying gastrointestinal issues, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or malabsorption, which may require further evaluation and management.
7. Metabolic complications: The patient's blood glucose levels may indicate underlying metabolic issues, such as diabetes or hyperglycemia, which may require further evaluation and management.
8. Thromboembolic complications: The patient's history of falls and weakness may indicate an increased risk of thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, which may require further evaluation and management.

Further evaluation and management are needed to address these potential complications and ensure the patient's optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo M w/ AVR on coumadin, CHB pacer dependent, Afib, prostate CA on
   hydrocortisone presents from home with acute onset chills and vomiting
   followed by septic shock and respiratory failure, now resolving.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Improved with >2.5L diuresis yesterday,
   now length of stay negative. Currently 99-100% on RA during the day, 2L
   by NC overnight for comfort.  Patient
s breathing unlabored sitting up,
   but remains mildly wheezy with crackles when lying flat.
   - Lasix 40mg PO daily with 40mg IV Lasix PRN, with close eye to renal
   function
   - Wean O2 as tolerates
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Patient pacer dependent s/p AVR with St. Jude
   valve on Coumadin. INR still supratherapeutic at 5.9 (goal 2.5-3.5)
   with e/o of conjunctival hemorrhage, but stable HCT.
   - Continue to hold Coumadin
   - Monitor closely for visual changes and other sources of bleeding
   - Daily HCT
   - Monitor Coumadin dosing closely if ketoconazole is restarted on d/c.
   # Hypertension: Patient with elevated sbp
s yesterday despite diuresis
   on home antihypertensives, in the setting of restarting home steroids.
   Will require good bp control given diastolic heart failure and tendency
   for pulmonary edema.
   - Continue Lisinopril 40mg PO daily
   - Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5mg PO BID
   - Consider increasing Metoprolol to 25mg PO BID (given patient is
   paced)
   # Diarrhea: Patient with infrequent watery diarrhea over past 2 days.
   C. diff screen negative, C. jejuni pending. [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to
   medication/diet. Remains afebrile with normal WBC.
   - F/U C. jejuni
   - If culture negative, can give Loperamide PRN for comfort
   # Septic Shock: Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive GBS
   & E. coli urine cultures; possibly PNA with CXR with ?of consolidation
   at admission. Now afebrile, downtrending WBC, CXR with pulm edema but
   no e/o PNA. Patient w/ h/o urosepsis after urologic procedure ~ 3 years
   ago.
   - Continue Cepodoxime, day [**5-1**]
   - Continue Hydrocortisone
   # Delirium: Improved despite restarting home steroids on [**2-19**]. Prior
   delirium likely multifactorial in context of septic shock, ICU stay,
   and steroids.
   - Zyprexa PRN: agitation
   - Continue home Hydrocortisone 10 mg q AM, 20 q PM
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Consider D/C
ing Foley today
   # Anemia: Stable over past 24 hours. Hct 39.0 today. Low haptoglobin on
   admission suggested infection driven hemolysis, but appears to have
   resolved with treatment of infection.
   - Trend HCT
   - Guaiac all stools
   - PIV in place, active T/S
   # Acute Renal Failure:
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), 1.7 on admission, today rose to 1.7 after
   aggressive diuresis.
   - Trend BUN/Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - Minimize additional diuresis if possible
   # Prostate CA:
   - PSA [**2130-2-20**] 95.2, 56.4 on [**2130-1-26**]
   - Continue to hold Ketoconazole, but will restart if QT stable & INR
   not supratherapeutic
   - Continue home steroids
   - Outpatient eval for ?sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia: Resolved. PLT count 158 this AM. At baseline of
   160-200s. DIC labs negative.
   - Continue to trend
   # Weakness/?Neuromuscular issue: Patient at baseline able to walk at
   home, climb stairs holding railing, get up from seated position, per
   wife.  [**Name (NI) 59**] acute change in his baseline functioning prior to admission.
   Would benefit from PT and getting OOB.  If not at baseline per family,
   can consider neurology consult.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Improved with >2.5L diuresis yesterday,
   now length of stay negative. Currently 99-100% on RA during the day, 2L
   by NC overnight for comfort.  Patient
s breathing unlabored sitting up,
   but remains mildly wheezy with crackles when lying flat.
   - Lasix 40mg PO daily with 40mg IV Lasix PRN, with close eye to renal
   function
   - Wean O2 as tolerates
   # Supratherapeutic INR: Patient pacer dependent s/p AVR with St. Jude
   valve on Coumadin. INR still supratherapeutic at 5.9 (goal 2.5-3.5)
   with e/o of conjunctival hemorrhage, but stable HCT.
   - Continue to hold Coumadin
   - Monitor closely for visual changes and other sources of bleeding
   - Daily HCT
   - Monitor Coumadin dosing closely if ketoconazole is restarted on d/c.
   # Hypertension: Patient with elevated sbp
s yesterday despite diuresis
   on home antihypertensives, in the setting of restarting home steroids.
   Will require good bp control given diastolic heart failure and tendency
   for pulmonary edema.
   - Continue Lisinopril 40mg PO daily
   - Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5mg PO BID
   - Consider increasing Metoprolol to 25mg PO BID (given patient is
   paced)
   # Diarrhea: Patient with infrequent watery diarrhea over past 2 days.
   C. diff screen negative, C. jejuni pending. [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to
   medication/diet. Remains afebrile with normal WBC.
   - F/U C. jejuni
   - If culture negative, can give Loperamide PRN for comfort
   # Septic Shock: Resolved. Presumably urinary source given positive GBS
   & E. coli urine cultures; possibly PNA with CXR with ?of consolidation
   at admission. Now afebrile, downtrending WBC, CXR with pulm edema but
   no e/o PNA. Patient w/ h/o urosepsis after urologic procedure ~ 3 years
   ago.
   - Continue Cepodoxime, day [**5-1**]
   - Continue Hydrocortisone
   # Delirium: Improved despite restarting home steroids on [**2-19**]. Prior
   delirium likely multifactorial in context of septic shock, ICU stay,
   and steroids.
   - Zyprexa PRN: agitation
   - Continue home Hydrocortisone 10 mg q AM, 20 q PM
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Consider D/C
ing Foley today
   # Anemia: Stable over past 24 hours. Hct 39.0 today. Low haptoglobin on
   admission suggested infection driven hemolysis, but appears to have
   resolved with treatment of infection.
   - Trend HCT
   - Guaiac all stools
   - PIV in place, active T/S
   # Acute Renal Failure:
   Baseline 1.3 ([**2130-1-26**]), 1.7 on admission, today rose to 1.7 after
   aggressive diuresis.
   - Trend BUN/Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - Minimize additional diuresis if possible
   # Prostate CA:
   - PSA [**2130-2-20**] 95.2, 56.4 on [**2130-1-26**]
   - Continue to hold Ketoconazole, but will restart if QT stable & INR
   not supratherapeutic
   - Continue home steroids
   - Outpatient eval for ?sclerotic lesions seen on OSH CT ab/pelvis
   # Thrombocytopenia: Resolved. PLT count 158 this AM. At baseline of
   160-200s. DIC labs negative.
   - Continue to trend
   # Weakness/?Neuromuscular issue: Patient at baseline able to walk at
   home, climb stairs holding railing, get up from seated position, per
   wife.  [**Name (NI) 59**] acute change in his baseline functioning prior to admission.
   Would benefit from PT and getting OOB.  If not at baseline per family,
   can consider neurology consult.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with acute onset chills and vomiting, followed by septic shock and respiratory failure. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, prostate cancer, and a St. Jude valve in his aortic valve. The patient is currently in the ICU with pneumonia, and his condition is improving.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, and blood pressure of 130/67 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula, and his respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show that his white blood cell count is 6.7 K/uL, and his hemoglobin is 13.6 g/dL. His creatinine is 1.7 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen is 23 mEq/L. His troponin-T is 0.02 ng/mL, and his lactate is 0.9 mmol/L.

The patient's medications include furosemide, lasix, and hydrocortisone. He is also receiving antibiotics for his pneumonia, and his C. diff and C. jejuni cultures are pending.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status is improving, and he is currently on 2L of oxygen by nasal cannula.
2. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is still supratherapeutic, and he is being closely monitored for visual changes and other sources of bleeding.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and he is being treated with lisinopril and metoprolol.
4. Diarrhea: The patient has had infrequent watery diarrhea over the past two days, and his C. diff screen is negative. His C. jejuni culture is pending.
5. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock has resolved, and he is now afebrile and downtrending.
6. Delirium: The patient's delirium has improved, and he is being treated with zyprexa and hydrocortisone.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, and he is being monitored for signs of infection-driven hemolysis.
8. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine is elevated, and he is being closely monitored for signs of acute renal failure.
9. Prostate cancer: The patient's prostate cancer is being monitored, and he is being treated with hydrocortisone.
10. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia has resolved, and he is being monitored for signs of bleeding.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he is still at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Bleeding: The patient's INR is still supratherapeutic, and he is at risk for bleeding.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly in his urinary tract.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine is elevated, and he is at risk for acute renal failure.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and a St. Jude valve, and he is at risk for cardiovascular complications.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis. He has made substantial improvement and is now able to move towards diuresis. His acute SIRS has resolved, and he is no longer experiencing respiratory distress. However, he still has coagulopathy with an INR of 5.9, and his blood pressure remains elevated. He is also experiencing diarrhea, hypertension, and benign hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR remains elevated at 5.9, which increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of his coagulation status and potential adjustments to his anticoagulation therapy are necessary.
2. Respiratory Distress: Although the patient's respiratory distress has improved, he still has intermittent rare wheezes. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and potential adjustments to his oxygen therapy are necessary.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, which increases the risk of cardiovascular complications. Close monitoring of his blood pressure and potential adjustments to his antihypertensive medications are necessary.
4. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may be a sign of an underlying gastrointestinal infection or inflammatory process. Close monitoring of his stool output and potential adjustments to his antibiotic therapy are necessary.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease if not properly managed. Close monitoring of his renal function and potential adjustments to his fluid management and electrolyte replacement are necessary.
6. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's delirium and confusion may be a sign of an underlying metabolic or neurological disorder. Close monitoring of his mental status and potential adjustments to his medication regimen are necessary.
7. Shock: The patient's septic shock has resolved, but he is still at risk of developing recurrent shock if not properly managed. Close monitoring of his hemodynamic status and potential adjustments to his fluid management and vasopressor therapy are necessary."
