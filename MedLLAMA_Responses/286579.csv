You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 77.5 kg male, was admitted to the ICU following a respiratory arrest and status epilepticus. He was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. His initial chest CT showed no pulmonary embolism, but he had left lower lobe atelectasis and mucous plugging. He was hypotensive, requiring two 1L normal saline boluses and sedation was lightened. Antibiotics were started for aspiration pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, and blood pressure of 118/43 mmHg. He is receiving propofol infusions and has a SpO2 of 94%.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of respiratory arrest and status epilepticus increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia. The patient is receiving antibiotics, but close monitoring of his respiratory status and lung function is necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation increases the risk of VAP. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and lung function is necessary to prevent further complications.
3. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and history of aspiration pneumonia increase the risk of sepsis. Close monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to detect any signs of sepsis.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of respiratory arrest and status epilepticus increases the risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and lung function is necessary to prevent further complications.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of status epilepticus increases the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, brain edema, and cerebral vasospasm. Close monitoring of his neurological status is necessary to detect any signs of complications.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypotension increases the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure. Close monitoring of his cardiovascular status is necessary to detect any signs of complications.
7. Infection: The patient's history of aspiration pneumonia and prolonged intubation increases the risk of infection. Close monitoring of his laboratory results and vital signs is necessary to detect any signs of infection.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor his respiratory, neurological, and cardiovascular status, as well as his laboratory results and vital signs, to detect any signs of complications and prevent further deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   #1 respiratory distress: Most likely scenario is that he had
   respiratory distress from aspiration secondary to sedation from the
   large amount of ativan he received in 5 hours. He had copious
   secretions on admission to the ICU and pooling in his oral pharynx.
   Other differential diagnosis includes AMI (EKG does have flipped TW in
   V2-4 but 3 sets of CE negative), PE (at high risk but unlikely given
   hypoxia resolved now), infection (does have elevated WBC of 17 from
   admission and low grade fevers and the WBC rose acutely in the setting
   of distress which was likely stress reaction). No evidence for CHF or
   fluid overload.  WBC trending down.  Infection- urine culture this
   admission was negative. Although CXR does not suggest infection,
   patient w/rhoncorous breath sounds b/l and Hx and sputum gram stain
   suggestive of aspiration pneumonia.
   -unasyn, vancomycin for aspiration pneumonia
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication affect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   #2 ventilator dependent: On AC. ABG shows respiratory alkalosis.
   Decreased tidal volume, RR.  Due to high levels of propofol desired by
   neuro, needs to remain on CMT Assist.
   -re-check ABG, adjust ventilator settings accordingly
   .
   #3 status epilepticus: Cause appears to be unknown. His medications are
   currently being adjusted to control the seizures. Precipitant could be
   infection given elevated WBC on admission of 17, vs suboptimal
   medication regimen vs new acute neurologic event such as new stroke.
   -appreciate neurology continuing to follow
   -continuous EEG
   -infection- CXR and urine are clear. He does have possible thrush on
   exam. Check blood cultures, sputum cx, C diff and treat thrush with
   nystatin. Could consider LP but would do other work up first.
   #4 Hypotensive.  Likely due to propofol sedation and dehydration.
   Fluid responsive, but pressure really improved when propofol sedation
   decreased.  Difficult b/c propofol goals for MICU team and neuro are
   different (neuro using as an antiepileptic medicine vs for sedation for
   intubation)
   -NSS bolus PRN (pt w/out Hx of CHF)
   -d/w neuro sedation issue
 discuss treatment goals
   .
   #5 EKG changes: likely just demand ischemia. Enzymes negative. Has risk
   factors of tobacco, HTN, hyperlipidemia.
   -continue asa, statin, not on BB currently but was as outpatient.
   .
   # h/o stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
   -continue asa
   .
   # hyperlipidema: continue statin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, resulting in residual aphasia and right hemiparesis. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory distress, status epilepticus, and aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient has respiratory distress due to aspiration secondary to sedation from the large amount of ativan he received in the past 5 hours. The differential diagnosis includes acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pulmonary embolism (PE), and infection. The patient has copious secretions on admission to the ICU and pooling in his oral pharynx.
2. Ventilator-dependent: The patient is ventilator-dependent and requires continuous mechanical ventilation (CMV) with assist (CMT Assist). The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows respiratory alkalosis, and the tidal volume and respiratory rate are decreased.
3. Status epilepticus: The patient has status epilepticus, and the cause appears to be unknown. The patient's medications are being adjusted to control the seizures, and the precipitant could be infection, suboptimal medication regimen, or new acute neurologic event such as new stroke.
4. Hypotensive: The patient is hypotensive, likely due to propofol sedation and dehydration. The patient is fluid-responsive, but the blood pressure improved when propofol sedation decreased.
5. EKG changes: The patient has EKG changes, likely due to demand ischemia. The enzymes are negative, and the patient has risk factors for coronary artery disease, including tobacco use, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia and is on a statin.
7. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, and the differential diagnosis includes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and sepsis.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 22.6
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 12.8 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 290
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01
* Glucose: 98 mg/dL
* Calcium (Ca++): 8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4): 2.4 mg/dL

The patient's radiology results show:

* Chest computed tomography (CT) scan: left lower lobe atelectasis and mucous plugging
* Electrocardiogram (EKG): flipped T-waves in V2-4, but three sets of creatine kinase (CK) enzymes are negative

The patient's plan includes:

1. Unasyn and vancomycin for aspiration pneumonia
2. Avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones, Flagyl)
3. Follow blood cultures, stool for Clostridium difficile (C. diff)
4. Medication adjustment: hold standing ativan, continue anti-seizure medications
5. Suction aggressively
6. Re-check ABG and adjust ventilator settings accordingly
7. Continuous EEG
8. Infection workup: CXR and urine are clear, but the patient has possible thrush on exam
9. Consider lumbar puncture (LP) but would do other workup first
10. Hypotension management: NSS bolus PRN, discuss treatment goals with neurology

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   # respiratory distress: Most likely scenario is that he had respiratory
   distress from aspiration secondary to sedation from the large amount of
   ativan he received in 5 hours. He had copious secretions on admission
   to the ICU and pooling in his oral pharynx. Other differential
   diagnosis includes AMI (EKG does have flipped TW in V2-4 but first set
   of CE negative), PE (at high risk but unlikely given hypoxia resolved
   now), infection (does have elevated WBC of 17 from admission and low
   grade fevers and the WBC rose acutely in the setting of distress which
   was likely stress reaction). No evidence for CHF or fluid overload.
   -AMI- unlikely but continue ROMI and monitor on tele.
   -PE- check CTA chest for PE. If it was positive, will have to speak
   with neurology regarding whether he can be systemically anticoagulated
   given his stroke history.
   -infection- urine culture this admission was negative. CXR does not
   suggest infection. Send BCx, sputum culture, stool for C diff.
   -medication affect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suctions aggressively
   .
   # ventilator dependent: On AC. ABG is good. Decreased FIO2.  After
   imaging studies today, consider changing to pressure support from AC
   ventilation.
   .
   # status epilepticus: Cause appears to be unknown. His medications are
   currently being adjusted to control the seizures. Precipitant could be
   infection given elevated WBC on admission of 17, vs suboptimal
   medication regimen vs new acute neurologic event such as new stroke.
   -appreciate neurology continuing to follow
   -continuous EEG
   -infection- CXR and urine are clear. He does have possible thrush on
   exam. Check blood cultures, sputum cx, C diff and treat thrush with
   nystatin. Could consider LP but would do other work up first.
   -suboptimal medications- per neurology recs continue keppra 2000mg IV
   q12hr, depakote 500mg IV q8hr, trileptal 600mg PO per NGT [**Hospital1 7**]
   -? new neurologic event- check non-contrast head CT
   .
   # EKG changes: likely just demand ischemia. Continue to cycle enzymes.
   First set negative. Has risk factors of tobacco, HTN, hyperlipidemia.
   -continue asa, statin, not on BB currently but was as outpatient.
   -Discuss with neurology whether a higher dose asa can be used.
   .
   # h/o stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
   -continue asa

   # hyperlipidema: continue statin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history of left middle cerebral artery (L MCA) stroke, residual aphasia, and right hemiparesis, who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for status epilepticus and respiratory distress.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is mechanically ventilated with a FiO2 of 55% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The ABG shows a pH of 7.50, pCO2 of 37, and pO2 of 102.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is 118/43 mmHg, and his heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.
* Neurological: The patient is unresponsive and has no movement or tone.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 22.6, Hct 39.5, Plt 290
	+ Electrolytes: Na 140, K 3.1, Cl 103, Ca 8.1, Mg 2.1, PO4 2.4
	+ Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): 28
	+ Creatinine: 0.8
	+ Troponin-T: <0.01
	+ CK/CKMB: 62/3
	+ TCO2: 31
	+ Glucose: 98

The patient's potential medical complications are:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated, and the ABG shows a pH of 7.50, which may indicate respiratory acidosis. The patient's respiratory distress may be due to aspiration secondary to sedation or infection.
2. Infection: The patient has an elevated WBC count and low-grade fevers, which may indicate infection. The patient's urine culture and CXR are negative, but the patient may have a secondary infection.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's EKG shows flipped T-waves in V2-4, which may indicate myocardial infarction (AMI). The patient's troponin-T is <0.01, which is not consistent with AMI. However, the patient's risk factors for AMI include tobacco use, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's status epilepticus may be due to infection, suboptimal medication regimen, or a new acute neurologic event such as a new stroke.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has possible thrush on exam and may have a secondary infection. The patient is NPO for now, and his IVF is being monitored.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Respiratory support: The patient will continue to be mechanically ventilated, and the FiO2 will be decreased as tolerated.
2. Infection control: The patient will have a urine culture, CXR, and stool culture to rule out secondary infections. The patient will also receive antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia.
3. Cardiac management: The patient will continue to receive ASA and statin therapy to manage his risk factors for AMI.
4. Neurological management: The patient's medication regimen will be adjusted to control his seizures, and he will continue to receive continuous EEG monitoring.
5. Gastrointestinal management: The patient will have his IVF monitored, and he will receive nystatin for thrush."

   57 yr old man with CVA and refractory seizures was on Neuro floor last
   evening where he had recuurent seziures overnight, mild resp distress,
   given high dose benzos then found tachycardic, hypertensive, and
   hypoxemic, intubated for airway protection and tx to ICU for management
   1. Resp Distress: unclear what the initial precipitants for this were
   based on noteds in chart, it seems that he may have been having
   recurrent seizure and was getting high dose Ativan. DDx could be
   oversedation and choking on own secretions/aspiration, PE, cardiac
   ischemia. At this point we have stable ECG, cycle enzymes, check CTA to
   look for PE, he is on AC, after he finisihes his imaging m ay be able
   to switch to PSV but currently maintain on full ventilatory support
   2. Leukocytosis: stress response with recurrent SZ possible but need to
   pan culture, no empiric ABX at present
   3. Refractory SZ: now that he has NGT can get his trileptal in addition
   to IV Depakote. Would gte head CT - no con before CTA whiole he is on
   round trip.  Continuous EEG, close Neuro follow up.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   3. Refractory SZ: now that he has NGT can get his trileptal in addition
   to IV Depakote. Would gte head CT - no con before CTA whiole he is on
   round trip.  Continuous EEG, close Neuro follow up.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old man who was admitted to the ICU after being intubated for airway protection due to refractory seizures, respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient has a history of cerebral vascular accident (CVA) and was previously on the neuro floor, where he had recurrent seizures overnight.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and blood pressure of 137/77 mmHg. He is receiving invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. His electroencephalogram (EEG) is continuous, and he is receiving propofol at a dose of 60 mcg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 22.6, hemoglobin of 12.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 290. His troponin-T level is less than 0.01 ng/mL, and his creatinine level is 0.8 mg/dL.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation, which is being managed by the ICU team.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 137/77 mmHg, which is considered hypotensive. His hypotension is being managed with fluid resuscitation and vasopressors.
3. Refractory seizures: The patient has had recurrent seizures and is being managed with anticonvulsant medications, including trileptal and IV Depakote.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be due to a stress response or an underlying infection.
5. Cerebral edema: The patient has a history of CVA and may be at risk for cerebral edema, which could exacerbate his seizures and neurological symptoms.

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to his intubation and the presence of a nasogastric tube.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to his prolonged intubation.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis.
4. Cardiac arrest: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may increase his risk of cardiac arrest.
5. Neurological deterioration: The patient's refractory seizures and cerebral edema may lead to further neurological deterioration, including increased intracranial pressure and brain herniation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

* The patient is a critically ill individual with refractory seizures and respiratory failure, requiring invasive ventilation and intubation.
* The patient experienced a respiratory arrest at 09:40 AM, which led to intubation and transfer to the ICU.
* The patient's respiratory support includes a ventilator with settings of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14, and FiO2 of 60%.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 137/77 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
* The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels, with normal electrolyte levels.
* The patient's physical examination reveals an overweight/obese individual with an endotracheal tube and OG tube in place, with diminished breath sounds in the chest.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Pneumonia
* Sepsis
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrest
* Neurological damage due to prolonged status epilepticus
* Aspiration pneumonia due to altered mental status and inability to protect airway
* Gastrointestinal complications due to prolonged ICU stay and use of prophylactic medications
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and use of prophylactic heparin
* Stress ulcer due to critical illness and use of corticosteroids
* Infection due to prolonged use of invasive lines and devices."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old man who was admitted to the ICU with refractory seizures and respiratory failure. He had a respiratory arrest and was intubated for airway protection. The patient's condition is complicated by:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient has aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and left lower lobe (LLL) atelectasis, which is likely contributing to his respiratory failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be due to the increased propofol dose, and is responsive to fluid administration.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, likely due to a stress response related to recurrent seizures.
4. Refractory seizures: The patient has ongoing seizures despite treatment, and continuous EEG monitoring is recommended to monitor for seizure activity.
5. Altered mental status: The patient is deeply sedated and unresponsive, except to noxious stimuli.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and respiratory failure increase his risk for developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and mortality.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may indicate cardiac instability, which can worsen if not managed promptly.
4. Neurological deterioration: The patient's refractory seizures and altered mental status may worsen, leading to further neurological deterioration and potential long-term disability.
5. Infection: The patient's PNA and atelectasis increase his risk for developing secondary infections, which can worsen his respiratory failure and overall condition.

Based on the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, respiratory status, and neurological function. The patient's care should be individualized to address his specific needs, including management of his respiratory distress, hypotension, and refractory seizures."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old man admitted to the ICU with refractory seizures and respiratory failure. He was intubated for airway protection and transferred to the ICU for management. The patient has a history of CVA and has been experiencing recurrent seizures, respiratory distress, and altered mental status. He is currently receiving mechanical ventilation, sedation, and antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia and atelectasis. The patient's condition is critical, and he is at risk for aspiration, altered airway clearance, and cough.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is at risk for respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
2. Seizure Control: The patient's seizures are refractory, and he is at risk for further seizures, which could lead to status epilepticus and brain damage.
3. Infection: The patient has aspiration pneumonia and atelectasis, and he is at risk for developing sepsis, multi-organ failure, and death.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is fluid responsive, but he is at risk for developing hypovolemic shock, which could lead to organ failure and death.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to stress response, but it could also be a sign of infection, which could worsen his condition.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and deep sedation could lead to delirium, which could worsen his condition and increase his risk of mortality.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of CVA and hypotension could lead to cardiac ischemia, which could worsen his condition and increase his risk of mortality.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's seizures with anticonvulsant medications and consider alternative medications if necessary.
3. Continue to treat the patient's infection with antibiotics and consider adding additional antibiotics if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and fluid status closely and consider adding additional fluids or vasopressors if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's leukocytosis and consider adding additional medications if necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his sedation levels as needed.
7. Consider adding additional cardiovascular medications if necessary to manage the patient's hypotension and cardiac ischemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   #1 respiratory distress: Most likely scenario is that he had
   respiratory distress from aspiration secondary to sedation from the
   large amount of ativan he received in 5 hours. He had copious
   secretions on admission to the ICU and pooling in his oral pharynx.
   Other differential diagnosis includes AMI (EKG does have flipped TW in
   V2-4 but 3 sets of CE negative), PE (at high risk but unlikely given
   hypoxia resolved now), infection (does have elevated WBC of 17 from
   admission and low grade fevers and the WBC rose acutely in the setting
   of distress which was likely stress reaction). No evidence for CHF or
   fluid overload.  WBC trending down.  Infection- urine culture this
   admission was negative. Although CXR does not suggest infection,
   patient w/rhoncorous breath sounds b/l and Hx and sputum gram stain
   suggestive of aspiration pneumonia.
   -unasyn, vancomycin for aspiration pneumonia
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication affect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   #2 ventilator dependent: On AC. ABG shows respiratory alkalosis.
   Decreased tidal volume, RR.  Due to high levels of propofol desired by
   neuro, needs to remain on CMT Assist.
   -re-check ABG, adjust ventilator settings accordingly
   .
   #3 status epilepticus: Cause appears to be unknown. His medications are
   currently being adjusted to control the seizures. Precipitant could be
   infection given elevated WBC on admission of 17, vs suboptimal
   medication regimen vs new acute neurologic event such as new stroke.
   -appreciate neurology continuing to follow
   -continuous EEG
   -infection- CXR and urine are clear. He does have possible thrush on
   exam. Check blood cultures, sputum cx, C diff and treat thrush with
   nystatin. Could consider LP but would do other work up first.
   #4 Hypotensive.  Likely due to propofol sedation and dehydration.
   Fluid responsive, but pressure really improved when propofol sedation
   decreased.  Difficult b/c propofol goals for MICU team and neuro are
   different (neuro using as an antiepileptic medicine vs for sedation for
   intubation)
   -NSS bolus PRN (pt w/out Hx of CHF)
   -d/w neuro sedation issue
 discuss treatment goals
   .
   #5 EKG changes: likely just demand ischemia. Enzymes negative. Has risk
   factors of tobacco, HTN, hyperlipidemia.
   -continue asa, statin, not on BB currently but was as outpatient.
   .
   # h/o stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
   -continue asa
   .
   # hyperlipidema: continue statin
   .
   # FEN: start tube feeds.  mIVF, monitor lytes, replete as needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male admitted to the MICU with respiratory distress, status epilepticus, and a history of left middle cerebral artery stroke with residual aphasia and right hemiparesis.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has respiratory distress due to aspiration pneumonia, which is likely caused by sedation from the large amount of Ativan received in the past 5 hours. The differential diagnosis includes acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pulmonary embolism (PE), and infection.
2. Ventilator Dependence: The patient is ventilator-dependent and requires continued CMT Assist due to high levels of propofol. ABG shows respiratory alkalosis, and the patient's tidal volume and RR need to be re-checked and adjusted accordingly.
3. Status Epilepticus: The cause of the status epilepticus is unknown, and the patient's medications are being adjusted to control the seizures. The precipitant could be infection, suboptimal medication regimen, or a new acute neurologic event such as a new stroke.
4. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, likely due to propofol sedation and dehydration. Fluid responsiveness is present, but the patient's blood pressure improved when propofol sedation decreased.
5. EKG Changes: The patient has EKG changes, likely due to demand ischemia. Enzymes are negative, and the patient has risk factors for tobacco use, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
6. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which is being treated with Unasyn and vancomycin.
7. Infection: The patient has a risk of infection, and the urine culture from admission was negative. The patient has possible thrush on exam, and blood cultures, sputum CX, and C. diff testing are pending.
8. Dehydration: The patient is dehydrated, and IVF and NSS boluses are being given as needed.
9. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, and a statin is being continued.
10. History of Stroke: The patient has a history of left middle cerebral artery stroke with residual aphasia and right hemiparesis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia
* Avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold
* Follow BCx, stool for C. diff
* Hold standing Ativan and continue anti-seizure medications
* Suction aggressively
* Re-check ABG and adjust ventilator settings accordingly
* Continue continuous EEG
* Check blood cultures, sputum CX, and C. diff testing
* Treat thrush with nystatin
* Consider LP but would do other work-up first
* Continue NSS boluses PRN
* Discuss treatment goals with neurology
* Continue ASA, statin, and not on BB currently but was as outpatient
* Start tube feeds and monitor lytes, replete as needed
* Give heparin SQ for DVT ppx, bowel reg, H2 blocker for GI ppx, and VAP bundle."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   #1 respiratory distress: Most likely scenario is that he had
   respiratory distress secondary to sedation from the large amount of
   ativan he received in 5 hours. He had copious secretions on admission
   to the ICU and pooling in his oral pharynx.  CXR and sputum is
   concerning for aspiration.  No evidence of PE or CHF.  Blood & urine
   cultures negative thus far.
   -unasyn, vancomycin for aspiration pneumonia for 10 day course ([**10-18**]
   to [**10-27**]),
   - Follow sputum culture
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication effect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   #2 ventilator dependent: Due to high levels of propofol desired by
   neuro, needs to remain on CMT Assist.
   -re-check ABG, adjust ventilator settings accordingly
   .
   #3 status epilepticus: Cause unknown. Precipitant could be infection
   given elevated WBC on admission of 17, vs suboptimal medication regimen
   vs new acute neurologic event such as new stroke.  Depakote & propofol
   titrated up on [**10-18**].
   -appreciate neurology continuing to follow, will f/u with their recs.
   -continuous EEG
   -Could consider LP but would do other work up first & defer to
   neurology
   #4 Hypotensive.  Likely due to propofol sedation and dehydration.
   Fluid responsive, but pressure really improved when propofol sedation
   decreased briefly on am of [**10-18**].  Propofol increased thereafter for
   better seizure control.  Received 500 cc bolus x 3 overnight [**10-18**]
   [**10-19**] (1.5L total) with good response in bp & urine output.
   -500cc NS bolus PRN
   -d/w neuro sedation issue
   -if becomes fluid unresponsive after 2 L consider placing central line
   & starting neosynephrine.
   .
   #5 EKG changes: likely just demand ischemia. Enzymes negative. Has risk
   factors of tobacco, HTN, hyperlipidemia.
   -continue asa, statin, not on BB currently but was as outpatient.
   .
   # h/o stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
   -continue asa
   .
   # hyperlipidema: continue statin
   .
   # FEN: Tube feeds per nutrition recs; maintenance IVF, monitor lytes,
   replete as needed.
   .
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, bowel reg, H2 blocker for GI ppx, VAP
   bundle.
   .
   # Dispo: ICU level of care
   .
   # Code: full code

   # Communication: Concern from patient
s sister that the patient
s son
   is feeling overwhelmed.  SW & case management consults requested to
   help with family coping & assistance with dispo planning post
   hospitalization.  Plan for family meeting later in the week.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   #1 respiratory distress: Most likely scenario is that he had
   respiratory distress secondary to sedation from the large amount of
   ativan he received in 5 hours. He had copious secretions on admission
   to the ICU and pooling in his oral pharynx.  CXR and sputum is
   concerning for aspiration.  No evidence of PE or CHF.  Blood & urine
   cultures negative thus far.
   -unasyn, vancomycin for aspiration pneumonia for 10 day course ([**10-18**]
   to [**10-27**]),
   - Follow sputum culture
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication effect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   #2 ventilator dependent: Due to high levels of propofol desired by
   neuro, needs to remain on CMT Assist.
   -re-check ABG, adjust ventilator settings accordingly
   .
   #3 status epilepticus: Cause unknown. Precipitant could be infection
   given elevated WBC on admission of 17, vs suboptimal medication regimen
   vs new acute neurologic event such as new stroke.  Depakote & propofol
   titrated up on [**10-18**].
   -appreciate neurology continuing to follow, will f/u with their recs.
   -continuous EEG
   -Could consider LP but would do other work up first & defer to
   neurology
   #4 Hypotensive.  Likely due to propofol sedation and dehydration.
   Fluid responsive, but pressure really improved when propofol sedation
   decreased briefly on am of [**10-18**].  Propofol increased thereafter for
   better seizure control.  Received 500 cc bolus x 3 overnight [**10-18**]
   [**10-19**] (1.5L total) with good response in bp & urine output.
   -500cc NS bolus PRN
   -d/w neuro sedation issue
   -if becomes fluid unresponsive after 2 L consider placing central line
   & starting neosynephrine.
   .
   #5 EKG changes: likely just demand ischemia. Enzymes negative. Has risk
   factors of tobacco, HTN, hyperlipidemia.
   -continue asa, statin, not on BB currently but was as outpatient.
   .
   # h/o stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
   -continue asa
   .
   # hyperlipidema: continue statin
   .
   # FEN: Tube feeds per nutrition recs; maintenance IVF, monitor lytes,

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is ventilator-dependent and has a high risk of developing respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure, due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has copious secretions and pooling in his oral pharynx, which increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia. The presence of moderate GN rods in the sputum culture also suggests a high risk of aspiration pneumonia.
3. Status Epilepticus: The patient has a history of status epilepticus and is currently receiving anti-seizure medications. There is a high risk of recurrence, especially if the medication regimen is not optimal.
4. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which may be due to propofol sedation, dehydration, or other underlying conditions. This may lead to decreased perfusion of vital organs and increase the risk of organ dysfunction.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has received multiple boluses of IV fluids, which may lead to electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and tobacco use, which increases the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
7. Wound Complications: The patient has a history of stroke and may be at risk for developing wound complications, such as pressure ulcers or surgical site infections.
8. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing infections, particularly pneumonia, due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation and the presence of indwelling catheters.
9. Neurological Complications: The patient has a history of stroke and is currently experiencing neurological deficits, which may worsen or lead to new neurological complications, such as seizures or worsening aphasia.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should receive close monitoring and management by the ICU team, including frequent assessments of vital signs, electrolyte levels, and respiratory and cardiovascular function. Additionally, the patient should receive optimal medication management, including anti-seizure medications and antibiotics, as well as nutritional support and hydration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted to the ICU with status epilepticus and respiratory failure. He has a history of CVA and was intubated due to aspiration event triggered by seizures. He is sedated and has minimal responsiveness, with reactive pupils. He is receiving propofol for sedation and has been weaned off benzodiazepines. His respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 100% and ABG values within normal range. His cardiovascular status is also stable, with a blood pressure of 104/49 mmHg and a heart rate of 63 bpm.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and altered mental status increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Aspiration: The patient's risk of aspiration is high due to his altered mental status, inability to protect his airway, and the presence of an endotracheal tube.
3. Sepsis: The patient's history of CVA and respiratory failure increase his risk of developing sepsis.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CVA and respiratory failure increase his risk of developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's status epilepticus and altered mental status increase his risk of developing neurological complications, such as increased intracranial pressure or brain edema.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory failure increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as ileus or gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's immobility and respiratory failure increase his risk of developing venous thromboembolism.
8. Wound complications: The patient's respiratory failure and altered mental status increase his risk of developing wound complications, such as pressure ulcers or surgical site infections.

These potential complications highlight the importance of close monitoring and management of the patient's condition in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   1. Seizures/status epilepticus: Unknown cause. Concern for infection
   vs. subtherapeutic medications vs. new neurologic event (new stroke).
   Pt on Depakote and Trilepta.  Trilepta increased yesterday.  On
   Propofol gtt as per neuro recs with Levophed for BP support.
   - f/u with neurology regarding propofol and proper seizure management
   - LP today as arranged by neurology
   - MRI after EEG as per neuro
   - continue Trilepta at new dosing, also Depakote
   - Acyclovir started for ?HSV, awaiting LP
   - continuous EEG
   - continue to monitor LFTs, triglycerides with Propofol
   .
   2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial with aspiration
   PNA and sedation.  Also seizures can be contributing to mental status
   changes and increased risk of aspiration.  CXR and sputum is concerning
   for aspiration and sputum is growing GNRs.  No evidence of PE or CHF.
   Blood & urine cultures negative thus far.
   -Continue Vancomycin (d #1 = [**2105-10-18**]), change Unasyn to Zosyn (d# 1
   today [**2105-10-20**]) to cover for pseudomonas.
   - Continue to follow sputum speciation
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication effect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   3. Hypotension.  Likely due to propofol sedation.  Pt was adequately
   fluid resuscitated with CVP 12 this morning and CXR looking more fluid
   overloaded.  Propofol increased overnight with Levophed for BP
   support.
   - continue Levophed with these high doses of Propofol
   - hold further fluid boluses for now given adequate fluid status and
   likely overloaded
   4. Bradycardia: Likely related to Propofol.
   - Levophed should improve bradycardia
   .
   5. EKG changes: likely demand ischemia. Enzymes negative. Has risk
   factors of tobacco, HTN, hyperlipidemia.
   -continue asa, statin, not on BB currently but was as outpatient.
   .
   6. h/o stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
   -continue asa
   .
   7. hyperlipidema: continue statin
   .
   8. FEN: Tube feeds per nutrition recs; maintenance IVF, monitor lytes,
   replete as needed.
   .
   9. PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, bowel reg, H2 blocker for GI ppx, VAP
   bundle.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   1. Seizures/status epilepticus: Unknown cause. Concern for infection
   vs. subtherapeutic medications vs. new neurologic event (new stroke).
   Pt on Depakote and Trilepta.  Trilepta increased yesterday.  On
   Propofol gtt as per neuro recs with Levophed for BP support.
   - f/u with neurology regarding propofol and proper seizure management
   - LP today as arranged by neurology
   - MRI after EEG as per neuro
   - continue Trilepta at new dosing, also Depakote
   - Acyclovir started for ?HSV, awaiting LP
   - continuous EEG
   - continue to monitor LFTs, triglycerides with Propofol
   .
   2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial with aspiration
   PNA and sedation.  Also seizures can be contributing to mental status
   changes and increased risk of aspiration.  CXR and sputum is concerning
   for aspiration and sputum is growing GNRs.  No evidence of PE or CHF.
   Blood & urine cultures negative thus far.
   -Continue Vancomycin (d #1 = [**2105-10-18**]), change Unasyn to Zosyn (d# 1
   today [**2105-10-20**]) to cover for pseudomonas.
   - Continue to follow sputum speciation
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication effect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   3. Hypotension.  Likely due to propofol sedation.  Pt was adequately
   fluid resuscitated with CVP 12 this morning and CXR looking more fluid
   overloaded.  Propofol increased overnight with Levophed for BP
   support.
   - continue Levophed with these high doses of Propofol
   - hold further fluid boluses for now given adequate fluid status and
   likely overloaded
   4. Bradycardia: Likely related to Propofol.
   - Levophed should improve bradycardia
   .
   5. EKG changes: likely demand ischemia. Enzymes negative. Has risk
   factors of tobacco, HTN, hyperlipidemia.
   -continue asa, statin, not on BB currently but was as outpatient.
   .
   6. h/o stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
   -continue asa
   .
   7. hyperlipidema: continue statin
   .

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of left middle cerebral artery stroke, residual aphasia, and right hemiparesis, admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to the MICU for respiratory distress. He has been receiving Propofol and Levophed for sedation and blood pressure support. The patient's current condition includes:

* Respiratory failure, likely multifactorial with aspiration PNA and sedation
* Hypotension, likely due to Propofol sedation
* Bradycardia, likely related to Propofol
* EKG changes, likely demand ischemia
* Hypernatremia, corrected by stopping NS fluids
* Hypoxic respiratory failure, with sputum growing GNRs and concern for aspiration

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizures: The patient's status epilepticus is ongoing, and the cause is unknown. The patient is receiving Propofol and Trilepta, but the seizure activity may not be fully controlled.
2. Infection: The patient has sputum growing GNRs, which may indicate a pulmonary infection. The patient is also receiving antibiotics for pneumonia.
3. Aspiration: The patient's respiratory failure and hypoxic respiratory failure may be contributing to his mental status changes and increased risk of aspiration.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to Propofol sedation, and the patient is receiving Levophed for blood pressure support.
5. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may be related to Propofol, and the patient is receiving Levophed to improve heart rate.
6. EKG changes: The patient's EKG changes may indicate demand ischemia, which may be related to his risk factors of tobacco use, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
7. Stroke: The patient has a history of stroke, which may be contributing to his current condition.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, which may be contributing to his cardiovascular risk factors.
9. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to his immobility and risk factors.
10. VAP: The patient is at risk for VAP due to his mechanical ventilation and risk factors.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's seizure activity and adjust medications as necessary.
2. Continue to treat the patient's infection with antibiotics and monitor for signs of progression.
3. Continue to provide respiratory support and monitor for signs of respiratory failure.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and heart rate and adjust medications as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's EKG changes and adjust medications as necessary.
6. Continue to provide DVT prophylaxis and monitor for signs of DVT.
7. Continue to provide VAP prophylaxis and monitor for signs of VAP.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's hyperlipidemia and adjust medications as necessary.
9. Continue to provide nutrition support and monitor for signs of malnutrition.
10. Continue to provide glycemic control and monitor for signs of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   #1 respiratory distress: Most likely scenario is that he had
   respiratory distress secondary to sedation from the large amount of
   ativan he received in 5 hours. He had copious secretions on admission
   to the ICU and pooling in his oral pharynx.  CXR and sputum is
   concerning for aspiration.  No evidence of PE or CHF.  Blood & urine
   cultures negative thus far.
   -unasyn, vancomycin for aspiration pneumonia for 10 day course ([**10-18**]
   to [**10-27**]),
   - Follow sputum culture
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication effect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   #2 ventilator dependent: Due to high levels of propofol desired by
   neuro, needs to remain on CMT Assist.
   -re-check ABG, adjust ventilator settings accordingly
   .
   #3 status epilepticus: Cause unknown. Precipitant could be infection
   given elevated WBC on admission of 17, vs suboptimal medication regimen
   vs new acute neurologic event such as new stroke.  Depakote & propofol
   titrated up on [**10-18**].
   -appreciate neurology continuing to follow, will f/u with their recs.
   -continuous EEG
   -Could consider LP but would do other work up first & defer to
   neurology
   #4 Hypotensive.  Likely due to propofol sedation and dehydration.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   #1 respiratory distress: Most likely scenario is that he had
   respiratory distress secondary to sedation from the large amount of
   ativan he received in 5 hours. He had copious secretions on admission
   to the ICU and pooling in his oral pharynx.  CXR and sputum is
   concerning for aspiration.  No evidence of PE or CHF.  Blood & urine
   cultures negative thus far.
   -unasyn, vancomycin for aspiration pneumonia for 10 day course ([**10-18**]
   to [**10-27**]),
   - Follow sputum culture
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication effect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   #2 ventilator dependent: Due to high levels of propofol desired by
   neuro, needs to remain on CMT Assist.
   -re-check ABG, adjust ventilator settings accordingly
   .
   #3 status epilepticus: Cause unknown. Precipitant could be infection
   given elevated WBC on admission of 17, vs suboptimal medication regimen
   vs new acute neurologic event such as new stroke.  Depakote & propofol
   titrated up on [**10-18**].
   -appreciate neurology continuing to follow, will f/u with their recs.
   -continuous EEG
   -Could consider LP but would do other work up first & defer to
   neurology
   #4 Hypotensive.  Likely due to propofol sedation and dehydration.
   Fluid responsive, but pressure really improved when propofol sedation
   decreased briefly on am of [**10-18**].  Propofol increased thereafter for
   better seizure control.  Received 500 cc bolus x 3 overnight [**10-18**]
   [**10-19**] (1.5L total) with good response in bp & urine output.
   -500cc NS bolus PRN
   -d/w neuro sedation issue
   -if becomes fluid unresponsive after 2 L consider placing central line
   & starting neosynephrine.
   .
   #5 EKG changes: likely just demand ischemia. Enzymes negative. Has risk
   factors of tobacco, HTN, hyperlipidemia.
   -continue asa, statin, not on BB currently but was as outpatient.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of left middle cerebral artery stroke, residual aphasia, and right hemiparesis, who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to the MICU for respiratory distress.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is ventilator-dependent due to high levels of propofol desired by neurology.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient is hypotensive, likely due to propofol sedation and dehydration. Fluid responsiveness has been demonstrated, but the patient's blood pressure improved briefly when propofol sedation decreased.
* Neurological status: The patient is unresponsive, with no movement or tone assessed.
* Laboratory results: The patient's WBC count is elevated, and blood and urine cultures are negative. His troponin-T level is <0.01, and his lactate level is 0.9 mmol/L.
* Medications: The patient is receiving propofol, levophed, and acyclovir. He is also receiving antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's ventilator-dependent status and the need for high levels of propofol sedation increase the risk of respiratory failure.
* Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and the need for antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia increase the risk of infection.
* Seizure recurrence: The patient's history of status epilepticus and the need for anticonvulsant medications increase the risk of seizure recurrence.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotensive status and the need for vasopressors increase the risk of cardiovascular instability.
* Neurological deterioration: The patient's unresponsive state and the need for sedation increase the risk of neurological deterioration.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilator settings as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely and adjust vasopressor therapy as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status closely and adjust sedation therapy as needed.
* Continue to provide antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia and monitor for signs of infection.
* Consider performing a continuous EEG to monitor for seizure activity.
* Consider performing a LP to evaluate for potential causes of the patient's unresponsive state.
* Continue to provide nutrition and hydration support as needed.
* Continue to provide prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

It is also recommended that the patient's family be educated on his condition and the potential complications that can arise. A family meeting should be scheduled to discuss the patient's care plan and potential discharge options."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo male with history of CVA now admit with status epilepticus and
   requiring intubation and medication induced coma to break ongoing
   seizure activity.  This has been of limited beneift in terms of PLED
   activity persisting despite escalating doses of Propofol.
   1)Status Epilepticus-This persists despite increasing doses of Propofol
   and the trigger remains to be defined
   -Acyclovir in place
   -LP by Neuro team today as we were unsuccessful
   -Will need to move to Pentobarbitol as [**Doctor Last Name **] if activity persists and
   will utilize guidance from the Neurology team
   -Trileptal continuing
   -Depakote continuing
   -Will need to consider alternative [**Doctor Last Name **] to allow suppression of
   seizure activity
   -Will need a CNS image as soon as possible
   -Further propofol increase will be limited by both hypotension and
   bradycardia now present.
   2)Respiratory Failure-
   -Continue with A/C support with PEEP titration for hypoxemia
   -Patient with excellent tolerance of BP support
   -GNR's seen in sputum on gram stain
Unasyn/Vanco to change to
   Vanco/Zosyn
   3)Hypotension-
   -Likely a combination of medication effects and transient hypovolemia
   which is now resolved
   -Monitor for fever and will continue to support with pressors as
   needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted with status epilepticus, requiring intubation and medication-induced coma to break ongoing seizure activity. Despite increasing doses of Propofol, PLED activity persists. The patient has a history of CVA and is currently experiencing respiratory failure, requiring A/C support. He also has hypotension, which is likely due to a combination of medication effects and transient hypovolemia. The patient has a risk of aspiration, altered mental status, and seizure activity.

Potential medical complications:

1. Prolonged seizure activity: The patient's status epilepticus persists despite increasing doses of Propofol, and the trigger remains to be defined. This may lead to further complications, such as brain damage or increased risk of infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen, leading to decreased perfusion of vital organs and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to his CVA and medication-induced coma may increase his risk of infection.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's risk of aspiration and altered mental status may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and constipation.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypotension and hypoxemia may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's prolonged seizure activity and altered mental status may lead to neurological complications, such as brain damage, stroke, or increased intracranial pressure.
8. Increased risk of VAP: The patient's intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation may increase his risk of VAP.
9. Malnutrition: The patient's inability to eat and drink may lead to malnutrition and decreased immune function.
10. Increased risk of DVT: The patient's immobility and prolonged hospitalization may increase his risk of DVT."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   1. Seizures/status epilepticus: Unknown cause. Concern for infection
   vs. subtherapeutic medications vs. new neurologic event (new stroke).
   Patient on Depakote, Trileptal, Kepra, Phenytoin, and Propofol gtt as
   per neuro recs with Levophed for BP support.  Concern for increasing
   LFTs and triglycerides on propofol.  Neurology unsuccessful with LP
   attempt today.  Per neurology patient cannot have his EEG leads removed
   and thus cannot have an MRI scan at present.
   - f/u with neurology regarding propofol and proper seizure management
   - continuous EEG
   - MRI when able per neuro
   - Continue acyclovir for ?HSV, as unable to obtain LP
   - Vanco & ceftriaxone for bacterial meningitis, unlikely, but unable to
   rule out without LP data.
   - continue to monitor LFTs & triglycerides with Propofol
   .
   2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial with aspiration
   PNA and sedation.  Also seizures can be contributing to mental status
   changes and increased risk of aspiration.  CXR and sputum is concerning
   for aspiration and sputum is growing pan-sensitive E. coli.  No
   evidence of PE or CHF.  Blood & urine cultures negative thus far.
   -Continue Vancomycin (d #1 = [**2105-10-18**])
   - Change zosyn to ceftriaxone
 will treat both E. coli in sputum &
   possible bacterial meningitis.  (d/c Zosyn)
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication effect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   3. Hypotension.  Likely due to propofol sedation.  Pt was adequately
   fluid resuscitated with IVFand is total body volume overloaded
   currently.
   - continue Levophed with these high doses of Propofol
   - hold further fluid boluses for now given adequate fluid status and
   likely overloaded
   .
   4. Bradycardia: Likely related to Propofol.
   - improved with Levophed
   .
   5. EKG changes: likely demand ischemia. Enzymes negative. Has risk
   factors of tobacco, HTN, hyperlipidemia.
   -continue asa, statin, not on BB currently but was as outpatient.
   .
   6. h/o stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
   -continue asa
   .
   7. hyperlipidema: continue statin
   .
   8. FEN: Tube feeds per nutrition recs; maintenance IVF, monitor lytes,
   replete as needed.
   .
   9. PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, bowel reg (increased), H2 blocker for
   GI ppx, VAP bundle.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of left middle cerebral artery (L MCA) stroke in 2012, resulting in residual aphasia and right hemiparesis. He was admitted to the MICU for status epilepticus and respiratory distress.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: Hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to multifactorial causes, including aspiration PNA, sedation, and seizures. CXR and sputum are concerning for aspiration, and sputum is growing pan-sensitive E. coli.
* Cardiovascular status: Hypotension likely due to propofol sedation, with a high dose of Levophed required to maintain blood pressure. Bradycardia is also present, likely related to propofol.
* Neurological status: Status epilepticus, with seizures likely caused by infection, subtherapeutic medications, or a new neurologic event (new stroke). The patient is on multiple anti-seizure medications, including Depakote, Trileptal, Kepra, Phenytoin, and Propofol.
* Laboratory results: Elevated liver enzymes and triglycerides on propofol, with concern for increasing LFTs and triglycerides. Blood and urine cultures are negative, but sputum is growing pan-sensitive E. coli.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise.
* Sepsis: The presence of E. coli in the sputum and potential bacterial meningitis may lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or cardiac failure.
* Neurological deterioration: The patient's status epilepticus may worsen, leading to further neurological decline.
* Infection: The patient's respiratory and neurological status may lead to secondary infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuous EEG monitoring
* MRI scan when able
* Antibiotics for bacterial meningitis and E. coli in sputum
* Propofol sedation and Levophed for blood pressure support
* Suctioning and aggressive management of respiratory secretions
* Fluid resuscitation and management of hypotension
* Monitoring of liver enzymes and triglycerides on propofol
* Family meeting and social work/case management consults to assist with family coping and discharge planning."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   1. Seizures/status epilepticus: Unknown cause. Concern for infection
   vs. subtherapeutic medications vs. new neurologic event (new stroke).
   Pt on Depakote and Trilepta.  Trilepta increased yesterday.  On
   Propofol gtt as per neuro recs with Levophed for BP support.
   - f/u with neurology regarding propofol and proper seizure management
   - LP today as arranged by neurology
   - MRI after EEG as per neuro
   - continue Trilepta at new dosing, also Depakote
   - Acyclovir started for ?HSV, awaiting LP
   - continuous EEG
   - continue to monitor LFTs, triglycerides with Propofol
   .
   2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial with aspiration
   PNA and sedation.  Also seizures can be contributing to mental status
   changes and increased risk of aspiration.  CXR and sputum is concerning
   for aspiration and sputum is growing GNRs.  No evidence of PE or CHF.
   Blood & urine cultures negative thus far.
   -Continue Vancomycin (d #1 = [**2105-10-18**]), change Unasyn to Zosyn (d# 1
   today [**2105-10-20**]) to cover for pseudomonas.
   - Continue to follow sputum speciation
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication effect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   3. Hypotension.  Likely due to propofol sedation.  Pt was adequately
   fluid resuscitated with CVP 12 this morning and CXR looking more fluid
   overloaded.  Propofol increased overnight with Levophed for BP
   support.
   - continue Levophed with these high doses of Propofol
   - hold further fluid boluses for now given adequate fluid status and
   likely overloaded
   4. Bradycardia: Likely related to Propofol.
   - Levophed should improve bradycardia
   .
   5. EKG changes: likely demand ischemia. Enzymes negative. Has risk
   factors of tobacco, HTN, hyperlipidemia.
   -continue asa, statin, not on BB currently but was as outpatient.
   .
   6. h/o stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
   -continue asa
   .
   7. hyperlipidema: continue statin
   .
   8. FEN: Tube feeds per nutrition recs; maintenance IVF, monitor lytes,
   replete as needed.
   .
   9. PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, bowel reg, H2 blocker for GI ppx, VAP
   bundle.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   1. Seizures/status epilepticus: Unknown cause. Concern for infection
   vs. subtherapeutic medications vs. new neurologic event (new stroke).
   Pt on Depakote and Trilepta.  Trilepta increased yesterday.  On
   Propofol gtt as per neuro recs with Levophed for BP support.
   - f/u with neurology regarding propofol and proper seizure management
   - LP today as arranged by neurology
   - MRI after EEG as per neuro
   - continue Trilepta at new dosing, also Depakote
   - Acyclovir started for ?HSV, awaiting LP
   - continuous EEG
   - continue to monitor LFTs, triglycerides with Propofol
   .
   2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial with aspiration
   PNA and sedation.  Also seizures can be contributing to mental status
   changes and increased risk of aspiration.  CXR and sputum is concerning
   for aspiration and sputum is growing GNRs.  No evidence of PE or CHF.
   Blood & urine cultures negative thus far.
   -Continue Vancomycin (d #1 = [**2105-10-18**]), change Unasyn to Zosyn (d# 1
   today [**2105-10-20**]) to cover for pseudomonas.
   - Continue to follow sputum speciation
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication effect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   3. Hypotension.  Likely due to propofol sedation.  Pt was adequately
   fluid resuscitated with CVP 12 this morning and CXR looking more fluid
   overloaded.  Propofol increased overnight with Levophed for BP
   support.
   - continue Levophed with these high doses of Propofol
   - hold further fluid boluses for now given adequate fluid status and
   likely overloaded
   4. Bradycardia: Likely related to Propofol.
   - Levophed should improve bradycardia
   .
   5. EKG changes: likely demand ischemia. Enzymes negative. Has risk
   factors of tobacco, HTN, hyperlipidemia.
   -continue asa, statin, not on BB currently but was as outpatient.
   .
   6. h/o stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
   -continue asa
   .
   7. hyperlipidema: continue statin
   .
   8. FEN: Tube feeds per nutrition recs; maintenance IVF, monitor lytes,
   replete as needed.
   .
   9. PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, bowel reg, H2 blocker for GI ppx, VAP
   bundle.
   .

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of left middle cerebral artery (L MCA) stroke, resulting in residual aphasia and right hemiparesis. He was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for respiratory distress.

The patient has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to a combination of factors including aspiration pneumonia, sedation, and seizures. His sputum is growing Gram-negative rods (GNRs), and he has been started on Vancomycin and Zosyn to cover for pseudomonas.

The patient's blood pressure is being supported with Levophed, and his heart rate is being monitored for bradycardia. His electrolyte levels are being monitored, and he is receiving IV fluids and nutrition.

The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) shows changes consistent with demand ischemia, but his enzyme levels are negative. He has risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including tobacco use, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.

The patient's family is concerned about his condition and has requested a family meeting to discuss his care and discharge planning. Social work and case management consults have been requested to assist with family coping and assistance with discharge planning.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may worsen if his respiratory status is not closely monitored and managed.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sputum is growing GNRs, and he has been started on antibiotics to cover for pseudomonas. However, if his infection is not properly managed, he may develop sepsis.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's EKG changes and risk factors for cardiovascular disease make him at risk for cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and myocardial infarction.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's history of stroke and status epilepticus make him at risk for neurological complications, including further seizures and neurological decline.
5. Infection: The patient's IV lines and tubes make him at risk for infection, including central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is being supported with tube feeds and IV fluids, but he may be at risk for malnutrition if his nutritional needs are not properly met.
7. Psychosocial complications: The patient's family is experiencing stress and anxiety related to his condition, and may require support and counseling to cope with his care and discharge planning."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo male with history of CVA now with presentation with status
   epilepticus and with subsequent respiratory failure in the setting of
   airway protection needed as escalating doses of sedating medications
   are used to attempt to control seizure activity.
   1)Status Epilepticus-
   -Dilantin added
   -Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3738**] to perform LP today, was deferred by Neuro yesterday after
   MICU team failed to obtain fluid on [**2105-10-19**] despite mulitple attempts.
   -Keppra
   -Trileptal
   -Depakote
   -Acyclovir all per neurology input
   -Will look to neurology recommendations in regards to future
   interventions and treatments given EEG findings today.
   2)Respiratory Failure-Patient with transient hypoxemia yesterday--this
   was in the setting of continued positive fluid balance and persistent
   seizure activity.  This may well be evolution of persistent
   non-hydrostatic pulmonary edema as well as pleural effusions.  He will
   need PEEP titration to allow increase in airspace recruitment.
   -E. Coli seen in sputum and will refine to  narrow coverage following
   LP results and will maintain Vanco/CTX at elevated doses
   3)Hypotension-This has been attributable
   -Vanco/CTX to continue for coverage of likely pulmonary pathogens and
   will narrow coverage with LP completed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo male with history of CVA now with presentation with status
   epilepticus and with subsequent respiratory failure in the setting of
   airway protection needed as escalating doses of sedating medications
   are used to attempt to control seizure activity.
   1)Status Epilepticus-
   -Dilantin added
   -Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3738**] to perform LP today, was deferred by Neuro yesterday after
   MICU team failed to obtain fluid on [**2105-10-19**] despite mulitple attempts.
   -Keppra
   -Trileptal
   -Depakote
   -Acyclovir all per neurology input
   -Will look to neurology recommendations in regards to future
   interventions and treatments given EEG findings today.
   2)Respiratory Failure-Patient with transient hypoxemia yesterday--this
   was in the setting of continued positive fluid balance and persistent
   seizure activity.  This may well be evolution of persistent
   non-hydrostatic pulmonary edema as well as pleural effusions.  He will
   need PEEP titration to allow increase in airspace recruitment.
   -E. Coli seen in sputum and will refine to  narrow coverage following
   LP results and will maintain Vanco/CTX at elevated doses
   3)Hypotension-This has been attributable
   -Vanco/CTX to continue for coverage of likely pulmonary pathogens and
   will narrow coverage with LP completed

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of CVA who is currently in the ICU with status epilepticus and respiratory failure. He has been receiving escalating doses of sedating medications to control seizure activity. His respiratory status is critical, with transient hypoxemia and persistent positive fluid balance, which may be contributing to non-hydrostatic pulmonary edema and pleural effusions.

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* Hematocrit: 36.2%
* White blood cell count: 10.9 K/uL
* Platelet count: 313 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 27 mEq/L
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 196 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
* LDH: 195 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.1 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Propofol
* Norepinephrine
* Dilantin
* Ranitidine (prophylaxis)
* Heparin sodium (prophylaxis)
* Vancomycin
* Piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn)
* Acyclovir
* Keppra
* Trileptal
* Depakote

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and further deterioration may lead to respiratory arrest or failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a pan-sensitive E. coli infection in his sputum, which may lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's persistent positive fluid balance and non-hydrostatic pulmonary edema may worsen his respiratory status.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen his cardiac output and increase his risk of organ dysfunction.
5. Infection: The patient's E. coli infection may spread to other parts of his body, leading to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's status epilepticus and altered mental status may lead to further neurological complications, such as brain injury or death.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor his respiratory status, fluid balance, and neurological function. The patient's medications should be adjusted to control his seizure activity and respiratory failure. Additionally, the patient's laboratory results should be closely monitored to detect any signs of infection or organ dysfunction."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   1. Seizures/status epilepticus: Unknown cause. Concern for infection
   vs. subtherapeutic medications vs. new neurologic event (new stroke).
   Patient on Depakote, Trileptal, Kepra, Phenytoin, and Propofol gtt as
   per neuro recs with Levophed for BP support.  Concern for increasing
   LFTs and triglycerides on propofol.  Neurology unsuccessful with LP
   attempt today.  Per neurology patient cannot have his EEG leads removed
   and thus cannot have an MRI scan at present.
   - f/u with neurology regarding propofol and proper seizure management
   - continuous EEG
   - MRI when able per neuro
   - Continue acyclovir for ?HSV, as unable to obtain LP
   - Vanco & ceftriaxone for bacterial meningitis, unlikely, but unable to
   rule out without LP data.
   - continue to monitor LFTs & triglycerides with Propofol
   .
   2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial with aspiration
   PNA and sedation.  Also seizures can be contributing to mental status
   changes and increased risk of aspiration.  CXR and sputum is concerning
   for aspiration and sputum is growing pan-sensitive E. coli.  No
   evidence of PE or CHF.  Blood & urine cultures negative thus far.
   -Continue Vancomycin (d #1 = [**2105-10-18**])
   - Change zosyn to ceftriaxone
 will treat both E. coli in sputum &
   possible bacterial meningitis.  (d/c Zosyn)
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication effect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   3. Hypotension.  Likely due to propofol sedation.  Pt was adequately
   fluid resuscitated with IVFand is total body volume overloaded
   currently.
   - continue Levophed with these high doses of Propofol
   - hold further fluid boluses for now given adequate fluid status and
   likely overloaded
   .
   4. Bradycardia: Likely related to Propofol.
   - improved with Levophed
   .
   5. EKG changes: likely demand ischemia. Enzymes negative. Has risk
   factors of tobacco, HTN, hyperlipidemia.
   -continue asa, statin, not on BB currently but was as outpatient.
   .
   6. h/o stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
   -continue asa
   .
   7. hyperlipidema: continue statin
   .
   8. FEN: Tube feeds per nutrition recs; maintenance IVF, monitor lytes,
   replete as needed.
   .
   9. PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, bowel reg (increased), H2 blocker for
   GI ppx, VAP bundle.
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   1. Seizures/status epilepticus: Unknown cause. Concern for infection
   vs. subtherapeutic medications vs. new neurologic event (new stroke).
   Patient on Depakote, Trileptal, Kepra, Phenytoin, and Propofol gtt as
   per neuro recs with Levophed for BP support.  Concern for increasing
   LFTs and triglycerides on propofol.  Neurology unsuccessful with LP
   attempt today.  Per neurology patient cannot have his EEG leads removed
   and thus cannot have an MRI scan at present.
   - f/u with neurology regarding propofol and proper seizure management
   - continuous EEG
   - MRI when able per neuro
   - Continue acyclovir for ?HSV, as unable to obtain LP
   - Vanco & ceftriaxone for bacterial meningitis, unlikely, but unable to
   rule out without LP data.
   - continue to monitor LFTs & triglycerides with Propofol
   .
   2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial with aspiration
   PNA and sedation.  Also seizures can be contributing to mental status
   changes and increased risk of aspiration.  CXR and sputum is concerning
   for aspiration and sputum is growing pan-sensitive E. coli.  No
   evidence of PE or CHF.  Blood & urine cultures negative thus far.
   -Continue Vancomycin (d #1 = [**2105-10-18**])
   - Change zosyn to ceftriaxone
 will treat both E. coli in sputum &
   possible bacterial meningitis.  (d/c Zosyn)
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication effect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   3. Hypotension.  Likely due to propofol sedation.  Pt was adequately
   fluid resuscitated with IVFand is total body volume overloaded
   currently.
   - continue Levophed with these high doses of Propofol
   - hold further fluid boluses for now given adequate fluid status and
   likely overloaded
   .
   4. Bradycardia: Likely related to Propofol.
   - improved with Levophed
   .
   5. EKG changes: likely demand ischemia. Enzymes negative. Has risk
   factors of tobacco, HTN, hyperlipidemia.
   -continue asa, statin, not on BB currently but was as outpatient.
   .
   6. h/o stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
   -continue asa
   .
   7. hyperlipidema: continue statin
   .
   8. FEN: Tube feeds per nutrition recs; maintenance IVF, monitor lytes,
   replete as needed.
   .
   9. PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, bowel reg (increased), H2 blocker for
   GI ppx, VAP bundle.
   .
   10. Dispo: ICU level of care
   .
   11. Code: full code
   .
   12. Communication: Concern from patient
s sister that the patient
s son
   is feeling overwhelmed.  SW & case management consults requested to
   help with family coping & assistance with dispo planning post
   hospitalization.  Plan for family meeting at 5pm today.  Family will be

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of left middle cerebral artery (L MCA) stroke in [**2102**] and residual aphasia and right hemiparesis. He was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to the MICU for respiratory distress.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Seizures/status epilepticus: Unknown cause, with concern for infection, subtherapeutic medications, or a new neurologic event (new stroke).
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial with aspiration PNA and sedation.
3. Hypotension: Likely due to propofol sedation, with total body volume overload.
4. Bradycardia: Likely related to Propofol, improved with Levophed.
5. EKG changes: Likely demand ischemia, with risk factors of tobacco, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
6. History of stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
7. Hyperlipidemia: Continue statin.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Increased risk of sepsis due to E. coli in sputum and possible bacterial meningitis.
2. Worsening of respiratory failure due to continued sedation and aspiration PNA.
3. Further decline in cardiac function due to continued propofol use and potential demand ischemia.
4. Increased risk of bleeding due to continued use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents.
5. Development of C. difficile colitis due to antibiotic use.
6. Further decline in nutritional status due to continued use of tube feeds and potential malabsorption.
7. Increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to prolonged immobility and anticoagulant use.
8. Development of pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and poor skin care.
9. Increased risk of medication errors due to continued use of multiple medications and potential interactions.

Assessment and plan:

1. Continue monitoring of the patient's seizures, respiratory status, and cardiac function.
2. Adjust propofol sedation as needed to balance sedation with respiratory and cardiac function.
3. Continue antibiotic therapy for E. coli in sputum and possible bacterial meningitis.
4. Monitor LFTs and triglycerides for potential effects of propofol.
5. Continue statin therapy for hyperlipidemia.
6. Monitor for signs of C. difficile colitis and adjust antibiotic therapy as needed.
7. Continue tube feeds and monitor nutritional status.
8. Monitor for signs of VTE and adjust anticoagulant therapy as needed.
9. Monitor for signs of pressure ulcers and adjust skin care as needed.
10. Continue to monitor for signs of medication errors and adjust therapy as needed.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust therapy as needed to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   1. ECG changes: Discussed with cardiology.  Possible medication effect
   due to multiple anti-epileptic medications, however this was discussed
   with neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3626**] who did not feel that medications would have
   caused this.  Appears currently hemodynamically stable, however
   Levophed requirements have increased while Propofol has decreased.
   Other possible etiologies include ACS and wall motion abnormalities
   leading to cardiogenic shock.
   - TTE today
   - check cardiac enzymes
   - monitor ECGs
   - f/u cardiology consult
   .
   2.  Seizures/status epilepticus: Unknown cause. Concern for infection
   vs. subtherapeutic medications vs. new neurologic event (new stroke).
   Patient on Depakote, Trileptal, Kepra, Phenytoin, and Propofol gtt as
   per neuro recs with Levophed for BP support.  Concern for increasing
   LFTs and triglycerides on propofol.  Neurology unsuccessful with LP
   attempt.  Without CSF to r/o meningitis, will continue to treat and abx
   changed yesterday to cover bacterial meningitis
   - continue abx for bacterial meningitis and acyclovir for viral
   meningitis
   - f/u with neurology regarding propofol and proper seizure management
   - continuous EEG
   - MRI when able per neuron, MRI-compatible leads being placed
   - continue to monitor LFTs & triglycerides with Propofol
   .
   3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial with aspiration
   PNA and sedation.  Also seizures can be contributing to mental status
   changes and increased risk of aspiration.  CXR and sputum is concerning
   for aspiration and sputum is growing pan-sensitive E. coli.  No
   evidence of PE or CHF.  Blood & urine cultures negative thus far.
   -current antibiotic treatment will cover for E. Coli PNA
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication effect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   4. Hypotension.  Concern that propofol is decreasing as Levophed is
   increasing.  Differential for hypotension includes hypovolemic which is
   unlikely given high volume status.  Cardiogenic possible after ECG
   changes and will f/u echo.  Septic shock is possible but pt has been
   afebrile, not bacteremia.  Spinal shock also a possibility given
   seizure activity.
   - continue Levophed to support blood pressure
   - hold further fluid boluses for now given adequate fluid status and
   likely overloaded
   .
   5. h/o stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
   -continue asa
   .
   6. hyperlipidema: continue statin
   .
   7. FEN: Tube feeds per nutrition recs; maintenance IVF, monitor lytes,

   blocker for GI ppx, VAP bundle.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of left middle cerebral artery infarction and residual aphasia and right hemiparesis, who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to the MICU for respiratory distress.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14, and PEEP of 12 cmH2O.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is 103/60 mmHg, and his heart rate is 84 beats per minute. He has increased requirements for Levophed, a vasopressor medication, and decreased requirements for Propofol, a sedative medication.
* Neurological: The patient is unresponsive, sedated, and has flaccid muscle tone.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 12.3 K/uL, and his platelet count is 272 K/uL. His lactate level is 0.9 mmol/L, and his troponin-T level is <0.01.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

* Cardiogenic shock: The patient's ECG changes, increased Levophed requirements, and decreased Propofol requirements may indicate cardiogenic shock.
* Sepsis: The patient's respiratory failure, hypotension, and increased requirements for Levophed may indicate sepsis.
* Meningitis: The patient's unresponsive state, flaccid muscle tone, and increased requirements for Levophed may indicate meningitis.
* Stroke: The patient's history of left middle cerebral artery infarction and current neurological symptoms may indicate a new stroke.
* Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and hypotension may indicate aspiration pneumonia.
* Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure and hypotension may indicate hypoxemic respiratory failure.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing antibiotics for bacterial meningitis and acyclovir for viral meningitis.
* Monitoring ECGs and cardiac enzymes.
* Performing a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) to assess cardiac function.
* Continuing to monitor the patient's neurological status and seizure activity.
* Aggressively suctioning the patient's airway to prevent aspiration.
* Holding standing Ativan and continuing anti-seizure medications.
* Continuing Levophed to support blood pressure.
* Monitoring the patient's electrolyte levels and repleting as needed.
* Providing tube feeds and maintenance IV fluids.
* Performing a family meeting to discuss the patient's condition and plan for post-hospitalization care."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo M with PMH of L MCA in [**2102**] with residual aphasia and R
   hemiparesis who was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to
   the MICU for respiratory distress.
   .
   1. Seizures/status epilepticus: Unknown cause. Concern for infection
   vs. subtherapeutic medications vs. new neurologic event (new stroke).
   Patient on Depakote, Trileptal, Kepra, Phenytoin, and Propofol gtt as
   per neuro recs with Levophed for BP support.  Concern for increasing
   LFTs and triglycerides on propofol.  Neurology unsuccessful with LP
   attempt today.  Per neurology patient cannot have his EEG leads removed
   and thus cannot have an MRI scan at present.
   - f/u with neurology regarding propofol and proper seizure management
   - continuous EEG
   - MRI when able per neuro
   - Continue acyclovir for ?HSV, as unable to obtain LP
   - Vanco & ceftriaxone for bacterial meningitis, unlikely, but unable to
   rule out without LP data.
   - continue to monitor LFTs & triglycerides with Propofol
   .
   2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial with aspiration
   PNA and sedation.  Also seizures can be contributing to mental status
   changes and increased risk of aspiration.  CXR and sputum is concerning
   for aspiration and sputum is growing pan-sensitive E. coli.  No
   evidence of PE or CHF.  Blood & urine cultures negative thus far.
   -Continue Vancomycin (d #1 = [**2105-10-18**])
   - Change zosyn to ceftriaxone
 will treat both E. coli in sputum &
   possible bacterial meningitis.  (d/c Zosyn)
   -avoid antibiotics that lower seizure threshold (fluoroquinolones,
   Flagyl)
   -follow BCx, stool for C diff.
   -medication effect- hold standing ativan. Will need to continue all
   anti-seizure medications given status and note these are sedation.
   -suction aggressively
   .
   3. Hypotension.  Likely due to propofol sedation.  Pt was adequately
   fluid resuscitated with IVFand is total body volume overloaded
   currently.
   - continue Levophed with these high doses of Propofol
   - hold further fluid boluses for now given adequate fluid status and
   likely overloaded
   .
   4. Bradycardia: Likely related to Propofol.
   - improved with Levophed
   .
   5. EKG changes: likely demand ischemia. Enzymes negative. Has risk
   factors of tobacco, HTN, hyperlipidemia.
   -continue asa, statin, not on BB currently but was as outpatient.
   .
   6. h/o stroke: L MCV s/p R hemiparesis and aphasia.
   -continue asa
   .
   7. hyperlipidema: continue statin
   .
   8. FEN: Tube feeds per nutrition recs; maintenance IVF, monitor lytes,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of left middle cerebral artery infarction (L MCA) and residual aphasia and right hemiparesis. He was admitted for status epilepticus and transferred to the MICU for respiratory distress. The patient's condition has deteriorated, and he is currently sedated and intubated. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, and triglycerides. The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) shows diffuse ST depressions in V2-V6, ST elevations in II, AVL, and QRS complexes. Cardiology has been consulted.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Seizures/status epilepticus: Unknown cause, with concerns for infection, subtherapeutic medications, or new neurologic event (new stroke).
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial, with aspiration PNA and sedation contributing to mental status changes and increased risk of aspiration.
3. Hypotension: Likely due to propofol sedation, with the patient being adequately fluid resuscitated but currently total body volume overloaded.
4. Bradycardia: Likely related to propofol, with improvement with Levophed.
5. EKG changes: Likely demand ischemia, with risk factors of tobacco, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
6. History of stroke: Left MCA s/p right hemiparesis and aphasia.
7. Hyperlipidemia: Continuing statin therapy.

The patient's medications include:

* Depakote
* Trileptal
* Kepra
* Phenytoin
* Propofol
* Levophed
* Acyclovir
* Vancomycin
* Ceftriaxone
* Ranitidine (prophylaxis)
* Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis)
* Dilantin

Potential medical complications:

1. Bacterial meningitis: The patient's condition is concerning for bacterial meningitis, and the antibiotics have been changed to cover this possibility.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate dehydrogenase levels suggest the possibility of sepsis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's EKG changes and risk factors for cardiovascular disease suggest the possibility of cardiac complications.
5. Neurologic complications: The patient's history of stroke and current neurologic status suggest the possibility of further neurologic complications.
6. Infection: The patient's respiratory and urinary tract infections may worsen if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics to cover possible bacterial meningitis and E. coli infection.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilation as needed.
3. Continue to manage the patient's sedation and pain with propofol and other medications.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, with frequent EKG monitoring and consideration of cardiology consultation.
5. Monitor the patient's neurologic status closely, with frequent neurologic assessments and consideration of neurology consultation.
6. Consider consultation with infectious disease and cardiology specialists to further manage the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo male with admission with status epilepticus now with some
   suggestion of improving control of seizure activity based on neurology
   review of EEG.  What is, however, concerning is that he is
   demonstrating a decreased response to painful simuli.  He has had
   persistent pressor requirement even in the setting of decrease in
   propofol dosing.  In addition he has evolution of significant ECG
   changes in a diffuse, non-anatomic distribution which is concerning for
   a medication effect with iscehmia, primary conduction system disease
   less likely, but ,the medications at their current levels are unlikley
   to contribute to these changes.
   1)
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   -Keppra
   -Depakote
   -Trileptal
   -Dilantin
   -Propofol 60-->40 and with increased TG
s will move to change sedating
   [**Doctor Last Name **] if further decrease in TG
s not seen with further propofol
   decrease
   -Amp/Vanco/CTX/Acyclovir for all possible sources of meningitis with
   inability to obtain LP to fully evaluate possibility of CNS infection.
   -MRI timing to be moved up in timing given both the absence of a clear
   source for his Status Epilepticus and the concerning findings on ECG
   overnight without clear evidence of source now that we have had some
   capacity to stabilize seizure activity.
   2)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   -Levophed at 0.18
   -Volume overload is clearly present
   -Wean levophed as possible
   -ECHO today
   -Is likely a combination of aspiration pneumonia, sedating medications
   and possible changes in cardiac output as we have failed to demonstrate
   an improvement in BP with wean of propofol.
   -Will trial 1 liter bolus this morning
   -Doubt spinal shock but is concerning lack of improvement with wean of
   propofol.  Will look to response to IVF bolus and ECHO to categorize
   persistent hypotension.
   3)ECG Changes
ST segment depressions-
   -Will check ECHO today to eval for possible pericardial insult of wall
   motion abnormalities
   -Will cycle CK
   -Will reposition CVL today if CXR shows very poor position although
   this is less likely as a source here
   -Replete lytes although they are normal at first check
   -Would be very atypical for
cerebral T-waves
 but may be a variant if
   all other causes are ruled out
will have to consider move up of timing
   for MRI study if seizures felt to be controlled
   Additional issues to be treated as defined in the housestaff note of
   this date.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo male with admission with status epilepticus now with some
   suggestion of improving control of seizure activity based on neurology
   review of EEG.  What is, however, concerning is that he is
   demonstrating a decreased response to painful simuli.  He has had
   persistent pressor requirement even in the setting of decrease in
   propofol dosing.  In addition he has evolution of significant ECG
   changes in a diffuse, non-anatomic distribution which is concerning for
   a medication effect with iscehmia, primary conduction system disease
   less likely, but ,the medications at their current levels are unlikley
   to contribute to these changes.
   1)
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   -Keppra
   -Depakote
   -Trileptal
   -Dilantin
   -Propofol 60-->40 and with increased TG
s will move to change sedating
   [**Doctor Last Name **] if further decrease in TG
s not seen with further propofol
   decrease
   -Amp/Vanco/CTX/Acyclovir for all possible sources of meningitis with
   inability to obtain LP to fully evaluate possibility of CNS infection.
   -MRI timing to be moved up in timing given both the absence of a clear
   source for his Status Epilepticus and the concerning findings on ECG
   overnight without clear evidence of source now that we have had some
   capacity to stabilize seizure activity.
   2)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   -Levophed at 0.18
   -Volume overload is clearly present
   -Wean levophed as possible
   -ECHO today
   -Is likely a combination of aspiration pneumonia, sedating medications
   and possible changes in cardiac output as we have failed to demonstrate
   an improvement in BP with wean of propofol.
   -Will trial 1 liter bolus this morning
   -Doubt spinal shock but is concerning lack of improvement with wean of
   propofol.  Will look to response to IVF bolus and ECHO to categorize
   persistent hypotension.
   3)ECG Changes
ST segment depressions-
   -Will check ECHO today to eval for possible pericardial insult of wall
   motion abnormalities
   -Will cycle CK
   -Will reposition CVL today if CXR shows very poor position although
   this is less likely as a source here
   -Replete lytes although they are normal at first check
   -Would be very atypical for
cerebral T-waves
 but may be a variant if
   all other causes are ruled out
will have to consider move up of timing
   for MRI study if seizures felt to be controlled
   Additional issues to be treated as defined in the housestaff note of
   this date.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male admitted with status epilepticus. The patient's condition has improved with some control of seizure activity, but there are concerns regarding decreased response to painful stimuli, persistent pressor requirement, and evolution of significant ECG changes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Medication-related complications:
	* Over-sedation with propofol, which may contribute to decreased response to painful stimuli and hypotension.
	* ECG changes may be related to medication effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities.
2. Infection-related complications:
	* Meningitis or other CNS infections may be present, which could be contributing to the patient's status epilepticus.
	* Aspiration pneumonia is a concern due to the patient's inability to protect their airway.
3. Cardiac-related complications:
	* Hypotension may be due to cardiac output changes, cardiac arrhythmias, or conduction abnormalities.
	* ECG changes may indicate cardiac insult, such as pericardial effusion or wall motion abnormalities.
4. Neurological-related complications:
	* Decreased response to painful stimuli may indicate a neurological injury or infection.
	* Status epilepticus may be a sign of underlying neurological disorder or infection.
5. Respiratory-related complications:
	* Aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure are concerns due to the patient's inability to protect their airway.
	* Respiratory support is necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Seizure management with Keppra, Depakote, Trileptal, Dilantin, and Propofol.
2. Antibiotics for possible meningitis or other CNS infections.
3. ECG monitoring to assess for cardiac arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities.
4. MRI study to evaluate for possible cardiac or neurological disorders.
5. Weaning of propofol to assess for sedation-related complications.
6. Trial of IVF bolus to assess for hypotension-related complications.
7. ECHO study to evaluate for cardiac output changes or cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Repositioning of CVL to assess for possible pericardial effusion or wall motion abnormalities.
9. Repletion of electrolytes to assess for possible imbalances.
10. Monitoring for signs of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to address the potential medical complications that can arise."
