Summary:

The patient, a 73-year-old male, is a chronic smoker with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute exacerbation of COPD, presenting with shortness of breath and somnulence for three days. He has a history of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6Â°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, and blood pressure of 131/43 mmHg.

The patient is receiving various treatments, including mechanical ventilation, oxygen therapy, and medications such as levofloxacin, heparin, and steroids. He is also receiving fluids and electrolyte repletion, as well as cardiac diet.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation could lead to respiratory failure, which is a life-threatening condition.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's CHF could worsen due to the volume overload and exacerbate the respiratory failure.
3. Infection: The patient's recent antibiotics and lack of fever or cough could suggest an underlying infection, which needs to be ruled out.
4. Delirium: The patient's hypercarbia and steroids could exacerbate his delirium, which needs to be closely monitored.
5. Anemia: The patient's HCT of 26 could indicate anemia, which needs to be trended and managed accordingly.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's fluid and electrolyte repletion could lead to electrolyte imbalance, which needs to be monitored and managed accordingly.
7. DVT: The patient's SC heparin prophylaxis could be inadequate, and he needs to be closely monitored for signs of DVT.
8. VAP: The patient's mechanical ventilation could increase his risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which needs to be closely monitored.
9. Restraints: The patient's restraints for safety could lead to skin breakdown and pressure ulcers, which need to be closely monitored and managed accordingly.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent potential complications and improve his outcomes."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient is being treated with levofloxacin and has a 20-gauge and 18-gauge central line in place. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98Â°F (36.7Â°C), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 131/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's acute exacerbation of COPD increases the risk of developing pneumonia, particularly given the patient's recent antibiotics.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's requirement for mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy increases the risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to cardiac arrest.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Sepsis: The patient's recent antibiotics and respiratory support increase the risk of developing sepsis, particularly if the patient develops a secondary infection.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's prophylactic heparin therapy may not be sufficient to prevent DVT, particularly if the patient has a history of DVT or is immobile.
6. Stress Ulcer Bleeding: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis may not be sufficient to prevent bleeding, particularly if the patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's requirement for mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP, particularly if the patient has a history of pneumonia.
8. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's ICU admission and mechanical ventilation may lead to nutritional deficiencies, particularly if the patient is not receiving adequate nutrition.
9. Glycemic Control: The patient's ICU admission and medications may increase the risk of developing hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, particularly if the patient has a history of diabetes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and congestive heart failure (CHF) who presents with acute exacerbation of COPD. He has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with hypercarbic respiratory failure, requiring non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and oxygen therapy. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 131/43 mmHg. He has scattered wheezes and rales at the right base on lung examination.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen, requiring further interventions such as invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's CHF may worsen due to fluid overload, leading to cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock.
3. Infection: The patient's lack of fever and normal white blood cell count do not rule out the possibility of underlying infection, which could worsen his respiratory and cardiac status.
4. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen due to hypercarbia, steroids, and other medications, leading to increased agitation, confusion, and risk of falls.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding or decreased erythropoietin production, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may worsen due to diuretic therapy, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or seizures.
7. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility and poor nutrition may increase his risk of developing pressure ulcers.
8. DVT: The patient's immobility and central venous catheter placement increase his risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which could lead to pulmonary embolism or leg swelling.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's COPD exacerbation is managed with BIPAP, nebs, and IV corticosteroids. His CHF is managed with diuretics and metoprolol. His DM2 is managed by holding glyburide. His delirium is managed with antipsychotics and restraints. His anemia is managed by trend HCT. His electrolyte imbalance is managed by repleting electrolytes. His ICU care includes cardiac diet, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

* The patient is a 73-year-old with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, and chronic kidney disease.
* The patient presents with shortness of breath (SOB) and somnulence for three days, with no history of fever, cough, or white blood cell count to suggest active infection.
* The patient's ABG shows hypercarbic respiratory failure with a CO2 level of 105 on admission, which improved to baseline levels with BIPAP.
* The patient has a history of COPD exacerbation, but the exact cause is unclear.
* The patient's physical examination shows signs of volume overload, with a soft and distended abdomen, and no cyanosis or edema.
* Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and lactate, as well as a low hemoglobin level.
* The patient is receiving various medications, including steroids, bronchodilators, and antibiotics, as well as respiratory support with BIPAP.
* The patient's delirium is exacerbated by hypercarbia and steroids, and the patient is being treated with antipsychotics and sedatives as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening of COPD exacerbation, leading to respiratory failure
* Development of acute kidney injury due to volume overload and electrolyte imbalance
* Progression of CHF, leading to further volume overload and heart failure
* Development of sepsis or septic shock due to underlying infections
* Worsening of anemia due to chronic kidney disease and blood loss
* Development of gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer disease
* Worsening of delirium and agitation due to hypercarbia and steroids."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of agitation, which was successfully managed with zyprexa and haldol. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, with an acute exacerbation.

Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.2Â°F), heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure of 159/55 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is 94% on a venti mask.

The patient has received various medications, including omeprazole, heparin sodium, and levofloxacin. Infusions include Heparin Sodium for prophylaxis, and other medications include zyprexa and haldol.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.2-6.9 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 28.3-27.8%
* Platelet count: 182-186 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8-0.9 mg/dL
* Total CO2: 42 mmHg
* Glucose: 270-291 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their delirium and confusion, and assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems is incomplete.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure due to acute exacerbation of COPD
* Cardiovascular instability due to hypotension and hypertension
* Infection due to prolonged ICU stay and use of invasive lines and devices
* Thromboembolic events due to immobility and use of heparin sodium
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Delirium and confusion due to underlying medical conditions and medication use
* Fluid imbalance due to excessive fluid administration and inadequate monitoring

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition, adjust medications as needed, and provide aggressive treatment for any potential complications that arise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and chronic heart failure (CHF) who presents with acute exacerbation of COPD and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has been treated with BiPAP and IV levo, and is currently on a regimen of medications including solumedrol, nebs, and lasix. The patient is also experiencing delirium, which is being managed with haldol and restraints. His laboratory results show hypercarbic respiratory failure, with a CO2 level of 105 on admission, which has improved to the 80s with BiPAP. His BNP level is 2600, indicating volume overload. He is also experiencing anemia, with a HCT level of 26, down from 30-32.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of COPD exacerbation: The patient's COPD exacerbation is currently being managed with BiPAP and IV levo, but there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the patient's condition is not closely monitored and managed.
2. Development of pneumonia: The patient's recent PNA and unclear history of COPD exacerbation make it possible that he may develop pneumonia, which would require further treatment and monitoring.
3. Volume overload: The patient's BNP level of 2600 indicates volume overload, which could worsen his respiratory failure and cardiac function if not managed properly.
4. Delirium: The patient's delirium is being managed with haldol and restraints, but there is a risk of worsening delirium if the patient's medication regimen is not carefully managed.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is being monitored, but there is a risk of worsening anemia if the patient's HCT level is not closely monitored and managed.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are not clearly stated in the note, but there is a risk of electrolyte imbalance if the patient's fluid and electrolyte balance is not closely monitored and managed.
7. DVT: The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to his immobilization in the ICU, and prophylaxis with SC heparin and SCD is being used to prevent this complication."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and chronic heart failure (CHF) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute exacerbation of COPD, somnulence, and shortness of breath (SOB) for three days. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchitis, and emphysema. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8Â°C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 159/55 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and bipap, and has been prescribed solumedrol, nebs, and IV levo.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute exacerbation of COPD may lead to respiratory failure, which is exacerbated by hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's CHF may worsen due to volume overload, which may lead to cardiac arrest.
3. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen due to hypercarbia, steroids, and other medications.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to chronic blood loss or bone marrow failure.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may worsen due to chronic kidney disease, diuretic therapy, and other medications.
6. Infection: The patient's lack of fever and white blood cell count may suggest an underlying infection, which may worsen if left untreated.
7. Volume overload: The patient's volume overload may worsen due to CHF, diuretic therapy, and other medications.
8. Blood transfusion reaction: The patient's recent blood transfusion may lead to a blood transfusion reaction, which may be life-threatening.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged use of bipap may lead to VAP, which is a common complication of mechanical ventilation.
10. Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI): The patient's indwelling urinary catheter may lead to CAUTI, which is a common complication of indwelling catheters."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old female admitted to the ICU with acute on chronic hypercarbic failure due to COPD exacerbation and volume overload. She has a history of schizophrenia and is currently receiving treatment for agitation with haldol and zyprexa. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8Â°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure of 129/48 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 93%. Her respiratory support includes nasal cannula and alb/atrov nebs. Her medications include lasix, solumedrol, and azithromycin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation and volume overload may lead to respiratory failure, which could worsen her condition.
2. Infection: The patient's increased agitation and delirium may be caused by an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate cardiac complications, such as tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant medications and her history of COPD may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Worsening of COPD: The patient's COPD exacerbation may worsen if not properly managed, leading to respiratory failure and other complications.
6. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen if not managed effectively, leading to increased agitation, confusion, and risk of falls or other accidents.
7. Skin breakdown: The patient's immobility and increased risk of pressure ulcers may lead to skin breakdown and other complications.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's poor appetite and increased metabolic demands may lead to nutritional deficiencies, which could worsen her condition.
9. Infection-related complications: The patient's increased risk of infection may lead to complications such as sepsis, organ failure, and death."

   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   -need to review all medications and OMR.  At present, the role of each
   is not clear.  For example, is the progestin meant to be primary
   treatment for her respiratory disease?  How did her psychiatric
   medication regimen get to present state.  Ask pharmacy to help.  If
   still an issue, consider psych consult for psychopharm mgmt assistance.
   -consider sleep consult for chronic management
   -wean steroids (help wtih neuropsych sxs)
   -spoke with daughter who was concerned that pt. was not on home BiPap
   settings and wanted to know that carbon dioxide was coming down;
   someone should touch base with her every day
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure:
    Patient's symptoms of SOB, agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest
   COPD exacerbation but unclear precipitant given lack of fever,
   infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF
   and volume overload were worse from baseline and were exacerbating
   respiratory symptoms but now euvolemic with developing metabolic
   alkalosis. Given 25% of COPD exacerbaions of unclear etiology can be
   triggered by an underlying PE, will pursue further workup with CTA.CO2
   of 105 on admit ABG, improved to 80s with BiPAP. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission. Most recent ABG suggests chronic repiratory acidosis with
   developing concomitant metabolic alkalosis.   Will start to wean
   steroids since likely exacerbating agitation
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2
   - continue BiPAP at night per home settings
   - home advair
   - f/u final blood cultures
   - continue azithromycin for 5-day course, Day [**5-4**]
   - wean O2 as tolerated to baseline to maintain sats 90%
   .
   # Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic:
   CXR from this am with persistent cardiomegaly but improved pulmonary
   edema and has had trending up bicarb likely from diuresis and
   contraction alkaslosis. Currently appears euvolemic. Patient had been
   on home dose of lasix 80mg PO daily, but will hold for now given
   adequate diuresis and euvolemia. Yesterday had autodiuresed -4L UOP
   over the last 24hrs. BNP was 2600 on admission, up from previous 800 in
   [**2132-4-30**].
   - Lasix prn SOB, e/o volume overload
   - hold additional lasix for now as autodiuresing
   - follow strict I/Os
   - continue metoprolol (change XL to short acting for titration, shorter
   effect), aspirin
   - repeat EKG this AM
   .
   # Agitation: Likely multifactorial secondary to hypercarbia and
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids vs underlying schizophrenia.
   Responded well to 5 mg Zyprexa previously, well to 2.5mg tonight.
   - hold Ultram, Rozerem, diphenhydramine
   - continue home Abilify, risperdal, Artane
   - Zyprexa prn for sundowning
   - restraints as needed
   # Diabetes mellitus II, well-controlled. Hemoglobin A1c of 6.8 in [**Month (only) 1996**]
   [**2132**]. Currently on home glyburide and HISS given hyperglycemia
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids.
   - continue home glyburide

   # Hyperlipidemia. No active concerns.
   - continue home simvastatin

   -need to review all medications and OMR.  At present, the role of each
   is not clear.  For example, is the progestin meant to be primary
   treatment for her respiratory disease?  How did her psychiatric
   medication regimen get to present state.  Ask pharmacy to help.  If
   still an issue, consider psych consult for psychopharm mgmt assistance.
   -consider sleep consult for chronic management
   -wean steroids (help wtih neuropsych sxs)
   -spoke with daughter who was concerned that pt. was not on home BiPap
   settings and wanted to know that carbon dioxide was coming down;
   someone should touch base with her every day
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure:
    Patient's symptoms of SOB, agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest
   COPD exacerbation but unclear precipitant given lack of fever,
   infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF
   and volume overload were worse from baseline and were exacerbating
   respiratory symptoms but now euvolemic with developing metabolic
   alkalosis. Given 25% of COPD exacerbaions of unclear etiology can be
   triggered by an underlying PE, will pursue further workup with CTA.CO2
   of 105 on admit ABG, improved to 80s with BiPAP. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission. Most recent ABG suggests chronic repiratory acidosis with
   developing concomitant metabolic alkalosis.   Will start to wean
   steroids since likely exacerbating agitation
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2
   - continue BiPAP at night per home settings
   - home advair
   - f/u final blood cultures
   - continue azithromycin for 5-day course, Day [**5-4**]
   - wean O2 as tolerated to baseline to maintain sats 90%

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, and schizophrenia. She was initially admitted to the MICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and was transferred to the floor on 4L O2. She was then transferred back to the MICU with agitation and persistent hypercarbia. Her current vital signs are: Tmax 36.8Â°C, Tcurrent 36.1Â°C, HR 83 bpm, BP 134/43 mmHg, RR 20 inspirations per minute, SpO2 98%, and heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has a number of medical issues, including:

* COPD exacerbation with hypercarbia
* CHF, with a BNP of 2600 on admission
* Diabetes mellitus II, with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.8
* Hyperlipidemia
* Anemia
* Hypothyroidism

The patient is currently receiving the following medications:

* Prednisone 60mg qd
* Albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2
* BiPAP at night per home settings

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure:
    Patient's symptoms of SOB, agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest
   COPD exacerbation but unclear precipitant given lack of fever,
   infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF
   and volume overload were worse from baseline and were exacerbating
   respiratory symptoms but now euvolemic with developing metabolic
   alkalosis. Given 25% of COPD exacerbaions of unclear etiology can be
   triggered by an underlying PE, will pursue further workup with CTA.CO2
   of 105 on admit ABG, improved to 80s with BiPAP. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The 73-year-old woman with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and CHF presents with SOB and somnolence for three days. She was initially admitted to the MICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred to the floor on 4L O2, and then returned to the MICU with agitation and persistent hypercarbia. The patient's symptoms suggest a COPD exacerbation, but the underlying cause is unclear. The patient's CO2 levels have improved from 105 to 80s with BiPAP, and her chest X-ray shows improved pulmonary edema.

The patient has several medical conditions, including:

1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation
2. Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic
3. Hyperglycemia
4. Delirium/confusion
5. Constipation
6. Anemia
7. Hypothyroidism
8. Hyperlipidemia
9. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome

The patient is receiving various treatments, including:

1. BiPAP therapy
2. Steroids (prednisone)
3. Albuterol/ipratropium nebs
4. Lasix (diuretic)
5. Metoprolol
6. Aspirin
7. Glyburide (antidiabetic medication)
8. HISS (home insulin sliding scale)
9. Simvastatin (statin medication)
10. Levothyroxine (thyroid medication)

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure
2. Cardiovascular instability
3. Hyperglycemic crisis
4. Infection (e.g., pneumonia, urinary tract infection)
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding
6. Dehydration
7. Electrolyte imbalance
8. Hypothyroidism
9. Hyperlipidemia
10. Anemia

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU.

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   -need to review all medications and OMR.  At present, the role of each
   is not clear.  For example, is the progestin meant to be primary
   treatment for her respiratory disease?  How did her psychiatric
   medication regimen get to present state.  Ask pharmacy to help.  If
   still an issue, consider psych consult for psychopharm mgmt assistance.
   -consider sleep consult for chronic management
   -wean steroids (help wtih neuropsych sxs)
   -spoke with daughter who was concerned that pt. was not on home BiPap
   settings and wanted to know that carbon dioxide was coming down;
   someone should touch base with her every day
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure:
    Patient's symptoms of SOB, agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest
   COPD exacerbation but unclear precipitant given lack of fever,
   infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF
   and volume overload were worse from baseline and were exacerbating
   respiratory symptoms but now euvolemic with developing metabolic
   alkalosis. Given 25% of COPD exacerbaions of unclear etiology can be
   triggered by an underlying PE, will pursue further workup with CTA.CO2
   of 105 on admit ABG, improved to 80s with BiPAP. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission. Most recent ABG suggests chronic repiratory acidosis with
   developing concomitant metabolic alkalosis.   Will start to wean
   steroids since likely exacerbating agitation
   - Will change solumedrol 80 IV TID to 60mg Prednisone daily in am
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2
   - BiPAP at night per home settings
   - home advair
   - f/u final blood cultures
   - continue azithromycin for 5-day course, Day [**4-3**]
   - wean O2 as tolerated to baseline to maintain sats 90%
   .
   # Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic:
   CXR from this am with persistent cardiomegaly but improved pulmonary
   edema and has had trending up bicarb likely from diuresis and
   contraction alkaslosis. Currently appears euvolemic. Patient had been
   on home dose of lasix 80mg PO daily, but will hold for now given
   adequate diuresis and euvolemia. Yesterday had autodiuresed -4L UOP
   over the last 24hrs. BNP was 2600 on admission, up from previous 800 in
   [**2132-4-30**].
   - Lasix prn SOB, e/o volume overload
   - hold additional lasix for now as autodiuresing
   - follow strict I/Os
   - continue metoprolol (change XL to short acting for titration, shorter
   effect), aspirin
   - repeat EKG this AM
   .
   # Agitation: Likely multifactorial secondary to hypercarbia and
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids vs underlying schizophrenia.
   Responded well to 5 mg Zyprexa previously, well to 2.5mg tonight.
   - hold Ultram, Rozerem, diphenhydramine
   - continue home Abilify, risperdal, Artane
   - Zyprexa prn for sundowning
   - restraints as needed
   # Diabetes mellitus II, well-controlled. Hemoglobin A1c of 6.8 in [**Month (only) 1996**]
   [**2132**]. Currently on home glyburide and HISS given hyperglycemia
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids.
   - continue home glyburide
   - HISS with QID fingersticks
   - wean steroids
   # Hyperlipidemia. No active concerns.
   - continue home simvastatin
   .
   # Anemia. Baseline hematocrit high 20s to low 30s. Most recent was 28
   and stable.
   - continue to trend daily hematocrit
   .
   # Hypothyroid. No active concerns.
   - continue home levothyroxine
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, cardiac diabetic diet, S/S consult
   for ? aspiration

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   73 y/o woman with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF
   presents with SOB and somulence x3 days, admitted initially to the MICU
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred to the floor on 4L O2
   now transferred back to MICU with agitation, persistent hypercarbia.
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure: Patient's symptoms of SOB,
   agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation but unclear
   precipitant given lack of fever, infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral
   syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF and volume overload were worse
   from baseline and were exacerbating respiratory symptoms but now
   euvolemic with developing metabolic alkalosis. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission.
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2 with home advair
   - continue BiPAP 18/10 per sleep recs. Will get ABGs after changes to
   monitor improvement. Sleep is following
   - f/u final blood cultures
   - continue azithromycin, day [**4-1**]
   - Continue steroid wean. Prednisone 10mg po [**8-21**] then stop.
   - Unclear why patient is on MedroxyPROGESTERone. Will discuss with PCP
   and consider stopping as could be worsening her OHV.
   -S/S consulted and recommended NPO, patient/family disagreed and she
   continue to eat despite understood risk of aspiration, so compromise
   was made for soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.
   - if transferred to floor, will have pulm continue to follow to monitor
   care
   # 9 beat asymptomatic Vtach: Patient at baseline has ectopic atrial
   rhythm with PVCs
   - No significant electrolyte abnormalities, will replete lytes as
   needed
   - changes in V6 only, not consistent with myocardial injury
   - Cont tele
   # Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic: CXR from this
   am with persistent cardiomegaly but improved pulmonary edema and has
   had trending up BUN likely from diuresis and contraction alkaslosis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   73 y/o woman with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF
   presents with SOB and somulence x3 days, admitted initially to the MICU
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred to the floor on 4L O2
   now transferred back to MICU with agitation, persistent hypercarbia.
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure: Patient's symptoms of SOB,
   agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation but unclear
   precipitant given lack of fever, infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral
   syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF and volume overload were worse
   from baseline and were exacerbating respiratory symptoms but now
   euvolemic with developing metabolic alkalosis. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission.
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2 with home advair
   - continue BiPAP 18/10 per sleep recs. Will get ABGs after changes to
   monitor improvement. Sleep is following
   - f/u final blood cultures
   - continue azithromycin, day [**4-1**]
   - Continue steroid wean. Prednisone 10mg po [**8-21**] then stop.
   - Unclear why patient is on MedroxyPROGESTERone. Will discuss with PCP
   and consider stopping as could be worsening her OHV.
   -S/S consulted and recommended NPO, patient/family disagreed and she
   continue to eat despite understood risk of aspiration, so compromise
   was made for soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.
   - if transferred to floor, will have pulm continue to follow to monitor
   care
   # 9 beat asymptomatic Vtach: Patient at baseline has ectopic atrial
   rhythm with PVCs
   - No significant electrolyte abnormalities, will replete lytes as
   needed
   - changes in V6 only, not consistent with myocardial injury

   # Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic: CXR from this
   am with persistent cardiomegaly but improved pulmonary edema and has
   had trending up BUN likely from diuresis and contraction alkaslosis.
   Currently appears euvolemic. Bicarb trending up could be in part from
   contraction alkalosis.
   - Patient had been on home dose of lasix 80mg PO daily, but will hold
   for now given adequate diuresis and euvolemia.
   - continue metoprolol (change XL to short acting for titration, shorter
   effect), aspirin
   # Agitation: Likely multifactorial secondary to hypercarbia and
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids vs underlying schizophrenia.
   - continue home Abilify, risperdal, Artane
   - Risperdal prn for aggitation. Per home psych Zyprexa has caused
   hyperglycemia
   - restraints as needed
   - Depakote and amonia levels low. Patient

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and chronic heart failure (CHF). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypercarbic respiratory failure, and later transferred back to the ICU due to agitation and persistent hypercarbia.

The patient's current medical issues include:

1. Hypercarbic hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, agitation, and hypercarbia suggest a COPD exacerbation, but the precipitant is unclear.
2. Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic: The patient has persistent cardiomegaly on chest X-ray, but improving pulmonary edema, suggesting diastolic heart failure.
3. Agitation: The patient's agitation is likely multifactorial, secondary to hypercarbia and exacerbated by high-dose steroids and underlying schizophrenia.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus II, and her hemoglobin A1c is 6.8. She is currently on home glyburide and has developed hyperglycemia exacerbated by high-dose steroids.
5. Anemia: The patient's most recent hematocrit is 28, which is stable but slightly lower than her baseline.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory arrest or respiratory failure.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's diastolic heart failure may progress, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.
3. Infections: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization may increase her risk of developing infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
4. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's poor nutritional status and risk of aspiration may lead to malnutrition, dehydration, or electrolyte imbalances.
5. Psychiatric complications: The patient's underlying schizophrenia and agitation may worsen, leading to increased risk of self-harm, aggression, or psychiatric hospitalization.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her respiratory status, cardiac function, glucose levels, and nutritional status. The patient's medications should be carefully titrated to minimize side effects and optimize her condition. Additionally, the patient's family and caregivers should be educated on her condition, treatment plan, and potential complications to ensure optimal care and communication."

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   73 y/o woman with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF
   presents with SOB and somulence x3 days, admitted initially to the MICU
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred to the floor on 4L O2
   now transferred back to MICU with agitation, persistent hypercarbia.
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure: Patient's symptoms of SOB,
   agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation but unclear
   precipitant given lack of fever, infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral
   syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF and volume overload were worse
   from baseline and were exacerbating respiratory symptoms but now
   euvolemic with developing metabolic alkalosis. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission. Most recent ABG suggests chronic repiratory acidosis with
   developing concomitant metabolic alkalosis.
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2 with home advair
   - continue BiPAP 18/10 per sleep recs. Will get ABGs after changes to
   monitor improvement. Sleep is following
   - f/u final blood cultures
   - continue azithromycin, day [**4-1**]

   -S/S consulted and recommended NPO, patient/family disagreed and she
   continue to eat despite understood risk of aspiration, so compromise
   was made for soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.
   # 9 beat asymptomatic Vtach: Patient at baseline has ectopic atrial
   rhythm with PVCs
   - No significant electrolyte abnormalities, will replete lytes as
   needed
   - changes in V6 only, not consistent with myocardial injury

   # Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic: CXR from this
   am with persistent cardiomegaly but improved pulmonary edema and has
   had trending up BUN likely from diuresis and contraction alkaslosis.
   Currently appears euvolemic. Bicarb trending up could be in part from
   contraction alkalosis, but more likely due to respiratory component.
   - Patient had been on home dose of lasix 80mg PO daily, but will hold
   for now given adequate diuresis and euvolemia.
   - continue metoprolol (change XL to short acting for titration, shorter
   effect), aspirin
   # Agitation: Likely multifactorial secondary to hypercarbia and
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids vs underlying schizophrenia.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and agitation. She has a history of chronic respiratory acidosis with a recent ABG showing a pH of 7.38, PCO2 of 86 mmHg, and PO2 of 59 mmHg. She has been treated with bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and has had a recent episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5Â°C, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 135/48 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 89% on BiPAP. Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, but no growth has been detected on blood cultures.

The patient's medical history is significant for COPD, CHF, diabetes mellitus type II, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She is currently taking a number of medications, including albuterol, ipratropium, and prednisone.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's history of COPD and recent episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response increases her risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory acidosis and recent episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response increases her risk of developing other cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's history of diabetes mellitus type II and recent episode of hyperglycemia increases her risk of developing hyperglycemia if not properly managed.
5. Infection: The patient's history of COPD and recent episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response increases her risk of developing an infection.
6. Cardiovascular disease: The patient's history of CHF and recent episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response increases her risk of developing cardiovascular disease.
7. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of COPD and recent episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response increases her risk of developing a pulmonary embolism.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of CHF and recent episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response increases her risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Renal failure: The patient's history of CHF and recent episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response increases her risk of developing renal failure.
10. Seizures: The patient's history of COPD and recent episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response increases her risk of developing seizures."

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   73 y/o woman with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF
   presents with SOB and somulence x3 days, admitted initially to the MICU
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred to the floor on 4L O2
   now transferred back to MICU with agitation, persistent hypercarbia.
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure: Patient's symptoms of SOB,
   agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation but unclear
   precipitant given lack of fever, infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral
   syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF and volume overload were worse
   from baseline and were exacerbating respiratory symptoms but now
   euvolemic with developing metabolic alkalosis. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission. Most recent ABG suggests chronic repiratory acidosis with
   developing concomitant metabolic alkalosis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with hypercarbic respiratory failure and later transferred to the floor and then back to the ICU due to agitation and persistent hypercarbia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is receiving bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) therapy and has a persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure. Her oxygen saturation is 89%, and her ABG values indicate chronic respiratory acidosis with developing metabolic alkalosis.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of CHF and is currently euvolemic with developing metabolic alkalosis. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) shows an irregular, narrow complex heart rhythm and one run of ventricular tachycardia (V-tach).
* Neurological: The patient is experiencing agitation, which is likely multifactorial secondary to hypercarbia and exacerbated by high-dose steroids.
* Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II and is currently on home glyburide and insulin sliding scale (HISS). She is also experiencing hyperglycemia exacerbated by high-dose steroids.
* Hematological: The patient has a history of anemia and is currently trending daily hematocrit values.
* Thyroid: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is currently on home levothyroxine.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure may lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of CHF and recent episode of V-tach may increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening.
* Hyperglycemic crisis: The patient's hyperglycemia exacerbated by high-dose steroids may lead to a hyperglycemic crisis, which can be life-threatening.
* Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's aspiration of food and liquids may lead to aspiration pneumonia, which can be life-threatening.
* Infection: The patient's history of chronic respiratory disease and recent hospitalization may increase her risk of infection, which can be life-threatening.
* Delirium: The patient's agitation and confusion may worsen her delirium, which can be a significant complication in the ICU.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, the following interventions are recommended:

* Continue BiPAP therapy and monitor the patient's respiratory status closely.
* Titrate the patient's steroids to minimize the risk of hyperglycemia and other side effects.
* Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels closely and adjust her insulin sliding scale as needed.
* Continue to trend the patient's daily hematocrit values and monitor her anemia.
* Monitor the patient's thyroid function and adjust her levothyroxine dose as needed.
* Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and replete them as needed.
* Consider consulting with a pulmonologist to optimize the patient's respiratory care.
* Consider consulting with an endocrinologist to optimize the patient's diabetes management.
* Consider consulting with a cardiologist to optimize the patient's cardiovascular care."

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   73 y/o woman with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF
   presents with SOB and somulence x3 days, admitted initially to the MICU
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred to the floor on 4L O2
   now transferred back to MICU with agitation, persistent hypercarbia.
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure: Patient's symptoms of SOB,
   agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation but unclear
   precipitant given lack of fever, infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral
   syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF and volume overload were worse
   from baseline and were exacerbating respiratory symptoms but now
   euvolemic with developing metabolic alkalosis. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission.
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2 with home advair
   - continue BiPAP 18/10 per sleep recs. Will get ABGs after changes to
   monitor improvement. Sleep is following
   - f/u final blood cultures
   - continue azithromycin, day [**4-1**]
   - Continue steroid wean. Prednisone 10mg po [**8-21**] then stop.
   - Unclear why patient is on MedroxyPROGESTERone. Will discuss with PCP
   and consider stopping as could be worsening her OHV.
   -S/S consulted and recommended NPO, patient/family disagreed and she
   continue to eat despite understood risk of aspiration, so compromise
   was made for soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.
   - if transferred to floor, will have pulm continue to follow to monitor
   care
   # 9 beat asymptomatic Vtach: Patient at baseline has ectopic atrial
   rhythm with PVCs
   - No significant electrolyte abnormalities, will replete lytes as
   needed
   - changes in V6 only, not consistent with myocardial injury
   - Cont tele
   # Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic: CXR from this
   am with persistent cardiomegaly but improved pulmonary edema and has
   had trending up BUN likely from diuresis and contraction alkaslosis.
   Currently appears euvolemic. Bicarb trending up could be in part from
   contraction alkalosis.
   - Patient had been on home dose of lasix 80mg PO daily, but will hold
   for now given adequate diuresis and euvolemia.
   - continue metoprolol (change XL to short acting for titration, shorter
   effect), aspirin
   # Agitation: Likely multifactorial secondary to hypercarbia and
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids vs underlying schizophrenia.
   - continue home Abilify, risperdal, Artane
   - Risperdal prn for aggitation. Per home psych Zyprexa has caused
   hyperglycemia
   - restraints as needed
   - Depakote and amonia levels low. Patient
s daughter stated that she
   does not take Depakote at home. Will clarify with psych if she needs to
   be on it.
   - psych following
   # Diabetes mellitus II, well-controlled. Hemoglobin A1c of 6.8 in [**Month (only) 1996**]

   exacerbated by high-dose steroids.
   - Have reduced steroids and stopped zyprexa. Increased sliding scale
   and will monitor blood sugar on SSI and glyberide
   - HISS with QID fingersticks
   # Hyperlipidemia. No active concerns.
   - continue home simvastatin
   # Anemia. Baseline hematocrit high 20s to low 30s. Most recent was 28

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Respiratory: The patient has persistent hypercarbia, with an ABG reading of 7.38/86/59/53. She is receiving BiPAP therapy and has a history of chronic respiratory failure.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic, with cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema on CXR. Her BUN is trending up, and her bicarb is trending up, which could be due to contraction alkalosis.
* Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus type II, well-controlled, with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.8. She is currently taking glyburide and metformin, and her blood sugar is being monitored with fingersticks.
* Hematological: The patient has anemia, with a baseline hematocrit of 28 and stable.
* Neurological: The patient has a history of schizophrenia and is currently taking risperdal, Artane, and Abilify. She is also experiencing agitation, which is likely multifactorial and secondary to hypercarbia and exacerbated by high-dose steroids.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent hypercarbia and chronic respiratory failure make her at risk for respiratory failure, which could worsen her condition.
* Cardiac failure: The patient's diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic, could worsen her cardiac function, leading to cardiac failure.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient's diabetes mellitus type II and use of glyburide and metformin make her at risk for hypoglycemia, which could worsen her condition.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient's diabetes mellitus type II and use of glyburide and metformin make her at risk for hyperglycemia, which could worsen her condition.
* Infection: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and use of steroids make her at risk for infection, which could worsen her condition.
* Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of aspiration and use of steroids make her at risk for aspiration pneumonia, which could worsen her condition.
* Delirium: The patient's agitation and use of steroids make her at risk for delirium, which could worsen her condition.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrine, hematological, and neurological status to prevent potential complications and improve her overall condition."

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   73 y/o woman with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF
   presents with SOB and somulence x3 days, admitted initially to the MICU
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred to the floor on 4L O2
   now transferred back to MICU with agitation, persistent hypercarbia.
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure: Patient's symptoms of SOB,
   agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation but unclear
   precipitant given lack of fever, infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral
   syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF and volume overload were worse
   from baseline and were exacerbating respiratory symptoms but now
   euvolemic with developing metabolic alkalosis. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission.
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2 with home advair
   - continue BiPAP 18/10 per sleep recs. ABG unchanged following sleep
   recs of 88-90%SaO2 o/n.
   - f/u final blood cultures
   - Continue steroid wean. stop prednisone.
   - Unclear why patient is on MedroxyPROGESTERone. Will discuss with PCP
   and consider stopping as could be worsening her OHV.
   -S/S consulted and recommended NPO, patient/family disagreed and she
   continue to eat despite understood risk of aspiration, so compromise
   was made for soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.
   - if transferred to floor, will have pulm continue to follow to monitor
   care
   # 9 beat asymptomatic Vtach: Patient at baseline has ectopic atrial
   rhythm with PVCs
   - No significant electrolyte abnormalities, will replete lytes as
   needed
   - changes in V6 only, not consistent with myocardial injury
   - Cont tele
   # Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic: CXR from this
   am with persistent cardiomegaly but improved pulmonary edema and has
   had trending up BUN likely from diuresis and contraction alkaslosis.
   Currently appears euvolemic. Bicarb trending up could be in part from
   contraction alkalosis.
   - Patient had been on home dose of lasix 80mg PO daily, but will hold
   for now given adequate diuresis and euvolemia.
   - continue metoprolol (change XL to short acting for titration, shorter
   effect), aspirin
   # Agitation: Likely multifactorial secondary to hypercarbia and
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids vs underlying schizophrenia.
   - continue home Abilify, risperdal, Artane
   - Risperdal prn for aggitation. Per home psych Zyprexa has caused
   hyperglycemia
   - restraints as needed
   - Depakote and ammonia levels low. Patient
s daughter stated that she
   does not take Depakote at home. Will clarify with psych if she needs to
   be on it.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   73 y/o woman with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF
   presents with SOB and somulence x3 days, admitted initially to the MICU
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred to the floor on 4L O2
   now transferred back to MICU with agitation, persistent hypercarbia.
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure: Patient's symptoms of SOB,
   agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation but unclear
   precipitant given lack of fever, infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral
   syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF and volume overload were worse
   from baseline and were exacerbating respiratory symptoms but now
   euvolemic with developing metabolic alkalosis. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission.
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2 with home advair
   - continue BiPAP 18/10 per sleep recs. ABG unchanged following sleep
   recs of 88-90%SaO2 o/n.
   - f/u final blood cultures
   - Continue steroid wean. stop prednisone.
   - Unclear why patient is on MedroxyPROGESTERone. Will discuss with PCP
   and consider stopping as could be worsening her OHV.
   -S/S consulted and recommended NPO, patient/family disagreed and she
   continue to eat despite understood risk of aspiration, so compromise
   was made for soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.
   - if transferred to floor, will have pulm continue to follow to monitor
   care
   -talk with sleep and talk with daughter concerning level of care
   necessary and most appropriate next step in care.
   -watch over night to let pt equilibrate in terms of respiratory
   status.  Consider acetazolamide tomorrow if respiratory status does not
   change.  Would need art line for acetazolamide.
   -ABG in PM

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   73 y/o woman with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF
   presents with SOB and somulence x3 days, admitted initially to the MICU
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred to the floor on 4L O2
   now transferred back to MICU with agitation, persistent hypercarbia.
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure: Patient's symptoms of SOB,
   agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation but unclear
   precipitant given lack of fever, infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral
   syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF and volume overload were worse
   from baseline and were exacerbating respiratory symptoms but now
   euvolemic with developing metabolic alkalosis. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission.
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2 with home advair
   - continue BiPAP 18/10 per sleep recs. ABG unchanged following sleep
   recs of 88-90%SaO2 o/n.
   - f/u final blood cultures
   - Continue steroid wean. stop prednisone.
   - Unclear why patient is on MedroxyPROGESTERone. Will discuss with PCP
   and consider stopping as could be worsening her OHV.
   -S/S consulted and recommended NPO, patient/family disagreed and she
   continue to eat despite understood risk of aspiration, so compromise
   was made for soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.
   - if transferred to floor, will have pulm continue to follow to monitor
   care
   -talk with sleep and talk with daughter concerning level of care
   necessary and most appropriate next step in care.
   -watch over night to let pt equilibrate in terms of respiratory
   status.  Consider acetazolamide tomorrow if respiratory status does not
   change.  Would need art line for acetazolamide.

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted to the MICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and was initially treated with BiPap and albuterol/ipratropium nebs. However, she was transferred to the floor and then back to the MICU due to persistent hypercarbia and agitation. The patient's symptoms include shortness of breath, agitation, and hypercarbia, suggesting a COPD exacerbation. The patient's daughter reports that the patient's baseline CO2 levels were in the 40s to 50s, but recent readings were in the 70s.

The patient has several medical conditions, including CHF, hyperlipidemia, anemia, and hypothyroidism. She is taking several medications, including glyburide, simvastatin, levothyroxine, and metoprolol. The patient's recent lab results show hyperglycemia, metabolic alkalosis, and a slightly elevated white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent hypercarbia and agitation suggest that she may be at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's CHF and recent diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation may lead to cardiac complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
3. Infection: The patient's recent blood cultures and urinalysis may indicate an infection, which could worsen her condition.
4. Delirium: The patient's agitation and hypercarbia may be contributing to her delirium, which could worsen if not addressed.
5. Aspiration: The patient's continued eating despite the risk of aspiration may lead to respiratory complications.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's recent lab results show a slightly elevated potassium level, which could lead to electrolyte imbalances if not addressed.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's recent hyperglycemia may worsen if not controlled with insulin therapy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue BiPap therapy and adjust as needed to maintain a SpO2 of 90% or higher.
2. Continue albuterol/ipratropium nebs and adjust as needed to control respiratory symptoms.
3. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust as needed to prevent imbalances.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy as needed to control hyperglycemia.
5. Consider acetazolamide therapy if the patient's respiratory status does not improve.
6. Consult with the sleep team to discuss the patient's level of care and most appropriate next step in care.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust therapy as needed to prevent cardiac complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   73 y/o woman with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF
   presents with SOB and somulence x3 days, admitted initially to the MICU
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred to the floor on 4L O2
   now transferred back to MICU with agitation, persistent hypercarbia.
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure: Patient's symptoms of SOB,
   agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation but unclear
   precipitant given lack of fever, infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral
   syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF and volume overload were worse
   from baseline and were exacerbating respiratory symptoms but now
   euvolemic with developing metabolic alkalosis. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission.
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2 with home advair
   - continue BiPAP 18/10 per sleep recs. ABG improved wearing BIPAP all
   night.
   - final Bcx negative.
   - Prednisone stopped
   -S/S consulted and recommended NPO, patient/family disagreed and she
   continue to eat despite understood risk of aspiration, so compromise
   was made for soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.
   - if transferred to floor, will have pulm continue to follow to monitor
   care
   -talk with sleep and talk with daughter concerning level of care
   necessary and most appropriate next step in care.
   -watch over night to let pt equilibrate in terms of respiratory

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and congestive heart failure (CHF). She was initially admitted to the MICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and was later transferred to the floor but returned to the ICU due to agitation and persistent hypercarbia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9Â°C (98.5Â°F), heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure of 75/20 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows euvolemia with a central venous pressure of 5 mmHg and a pulmonary artery occlusion pressure of 12 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 7.6-10.0 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 33.6-31.5%
* Plt: 13 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 0.8-1.0 mg/dL
* TCO2: 54-51 mmHg
* Glucose: 65-20 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.7 mmol/L
* LDH: 202 IU/L
* Ca++: 9.8 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.5 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2 with home advair
* BiPAP 18/10 per sleep recs
* Prednisone stopped
* Soft solids and nectar thickened liquids
* Glyburide and HISS for hyperglycemia
* Simvastatin for hyperlipidemia
* Levothyroxine for hypothyroidism
* Metoprolol and aspirin for CHF
* Abilify, risperdal, and Artane for agitation

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation
* Hypercarbic hypoxic respiratory failure
* Metabolic alkalosis
* Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic
* Agitation and delirium
* Hyperglycemia
* Hyperlipidemia
* Anemia
* Hypothyroidism

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing BiPAP therapy and monitoring ABG
* Considering acetazolamide if respiratory status does not improve
* Repleting electrolytes as needed
* Monitoring blood sugar and adjusting sliding scale insulin
* Trending daily hematocrit
* Continuing medications for COPD, CHF, and other conditions
* Monitoring for signs of respiratory failure, metabolic alkalosis, and other complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   73 y/o woman with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF
   presents with SOB and somulence x3 days, admitted initially to the MICU
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred to the floor on 4L O2
   now transferred back to MICU with agitation, persistent hypercarbia.
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure: Patient's symptoms of SOB,
   agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation but unclear
   precipitant given lack of fever, infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral
   syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF and volume overload were worse
   from baseline and were exacerbating respiratory symptoms but now
   euvolemic with developing metabolic alkalosis. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission.
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2 with home advair
   - continue BiPAP 18/10 per sleep recs. ABG improved wearing BIPAP all
   night.
   - final Bcx negative.
   - Prednisone stopped
   -S/S consulted and recommended NPO, patient/family disagreed and she
   continue to eat despite understood risk of aspiration, so compromise
   was made for soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.
   - if transferred to floor, will have pulm continue to follow to monitor
   care
   -watch over night to let pt equilibrate in terms of respiratory
   status.  Consider acetazolamide tomorrow if respiratory status does not
   change.  Would need art line for acetazolamide.
   # 9 beat asymptomatic Vtach: Patient at baseline has ectopic atrial
   rhythm with PVCs, no new Vtach o/n.
   - No significant electrolyte abnormalities, will replete lytes as
   needed
   - Cont tele
   # Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic: CXR from this
   am with persistent cardiomegaly but improved pulmonary edema and has
   had trending up BUN likely from diuresis and contraction alkaslosis.
   Currently appears euvolemic. Bicarb trending up could be in part from
   contraction alkalosis.
   - Patient had been on home dose of lasix 80mg PO daily, but will hold
   for now given adequate diuresis and euvolemia.
   - continue metoprolol (change XL to short acting for titration, shorter
   effect), aspirin
   # Agitation: Likely multifactorial secondary to hypercarbia and
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids vs underlying schizophrenia.
   - continue home Abilify, risperdal, Artane
   - Risperdal prn for aggitation. Per home psych Zyprexa has caused
   hyperglycemia
   - restraints as needed
   - psych following
   # Diabetes mellitus II, well-controlled. Hemoglobin A1c of 6.8 in [**Month (only) 1996**]
   [**2132**]. Currently on home glyburide and HISS given hyperglycemia
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids.
   - Have reduced steroids and stopped zyprexa. Increased sliding scale
   and will monitor blood sugar on SSI and glyberide
   - HISS with QID fingersticks
   # Hyperlipidemia. No active concerns.
   - continue home simvastatin
   # Anemia. Baseline hematocrit high 20s to low 30s. Most recent was 28
   and stable.
   - continue to trend daily hematocrit
   # Hypothyroid. No active concerns.
   - continue home levothyroxine
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, soft solids and nectar thickened
   liquids
   # Communication: with daughter and patient via phone interpreter
   # Code status: DNR/DNI (confirmed with daughter, HCP)

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and chronic heart failure (CHF). She was initially admitted to the MICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and was transferred to the floor, but was readmitted to the ICU due to persistent hypercarbia and agitation.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.9Â°C (98.5Â°F)
* Heart rate: 76 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 75/20 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 89%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.6 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 213 x 10^9/L
* Blood urea nitrogen: 65 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Glucose: 65 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Hypercarbic hypoxic respiratory failure
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation
* Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic
* Diabetes mellitus II, well-controlled
* Hyperlipidemia
* Anemia
* Hypothyroidism

The patient's medications include:

* Albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2 with home advair
* Bipap 18/10 per sleep recommendations
* Prednisone stopped
* Metoprolol (changed to short-acting for titration)
* Aspirin
* Abilify, risperdal, and Artane for agitation
* Glyburide and HISS for hyperglycemia
* Simvastatin for hyperlipidemia
* Levothyroxine for hypothyroidism

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation
* Cardiovascular instability due to CHF and hypotension
* Hyperglycemia due to diabetes and high-dose steroids
* Anemia due to chronic blood loss
* Hypothyroidism due to medication non-adherence
* DVT due to immobility and underlying risk factors

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing bipap therapy and monitoring respiratory status
* Considering acetazolamide therapy if respiratory status does not improve
* Monitoring and managing hyperglycemia with sliding scale insulin and glyburide
* Trending daily hematocrit and monitoring for anemia
* Continuing medications for COPD, CHF, and hyperlipidemia
* Monitoring for DVT with boots and SQ UF heparin
* Discussing transfer to regular floor with sleep fellow as attending."
