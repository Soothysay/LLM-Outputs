   24 Hour Events:
   72yo man w progressive HCC with mx liver lesions and [**Hospital 90**] transferred to
   the ICU after episode of BRBPR.
   --Consults from Liver, [**Doctor First Name **] and Renal.  Deferred further investigation
   of LGIB.  Thought to be secondary to hemorrhoids.
   -- PARACENTESIS - At [**2122-6-28**] 06:56 PM - done for diagnostic purposes
   to dx abdominal mets vs. portal HTN vs. SBP. Shows SAAG 1.1 and Polys
   440, cx and cytology pending.
   -- Yesterday late afternoon/evening - notified of low UOP.  Thought was
   foley cath obstructed & not draining.  The cath was flushed with no
   result.  Bladder scan showed 480 cc urine in bladder.  Foley was pulled
   Cadey cath ordered.  Could not be placed by nursing.  Urology consult
   -- cystocopy showed pt was aneuric with contracted bladder.
   -- Approx 1 hour after cystocopy, the patient developed severe dyspnea
   and required 2L of O2.  The patient was given an aerosolized saline tx
   to help with secretions.  It became apparent that SOB was worsening
   thought to be mechanical due to worsening ascites and .  Patient became
   diaphoretic, cold and clammy.
   --ABG was done PH 7.2  O2 78  CO2 40  HCO3 16  XS -11
   --Decision made to intubate for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   --Patient placed on fentanyl and versed and was bolused approx 2 liters
   of fluid.  He became hypotensive to SBPs in 70s after intubation.
   -- He has required dopamine currently at 10 to maintain MAP >60
   --Recently his Vent Peak pressures have been increasing PIP 40, plat
   35.  Decreased TV, Increased RR and Increased PEEP.
   --Attempted A-line -- could not do.  2 peripheral IVs
   --daughter came by around the time the patient was intubated.  request
   family mtg with onc today.

   Assessment and Plan
   72yo man w progressive HCC with mx liver lesions and [**Hospital 90**] transferred to
   the ICU after episode of BRBPR.
   .
   # respiratory failure - intubated on vent for hypoxemic respiratory
   failure.  Thought to be due to mechanical factors.  Large belly and
   possible fluid relocation to pleural space.
   - intubated, sedated on A/C -- continue current vent settings
   -
   # ARF: acutely worsening in last 24h.  marginal UOP all day yesterday.
   UOP will be 30cc per hour by 7pm with fluid also likely element of ATN.
   .  With additional fluid we are compromising resp status.  Consider
   dialysing today.
   - placed foley
   - monitor i/o and lytes
   - renal following
   - will start albumin [**Hospital1 **] for fluid challenge.  will start low dose
   midodrine and octreotide to see if underlying hepatorenal.  apprec
   liver and renal recs
   - renal u/s repeat today.
   # SBP -- likely given paracentesis
   -- cover with ceftriaxone.
   # BRBPR: suspect lower source given hemorrhoids on exam.  DDx includes
   lower sources: lower variceal bleed, external hemorrhoids, internal
   hemorrhoids, diverticulosis.  Upper sources: esophageal varices, PUD,
   gastric varices.
   - will give IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - goal hct>30
   - coags c k.
   .
   # hyponatremia: had improved with fluid restriction.  Appears total
   body up but intravasc dry likely from liver disease.  UNA<10.
   - have abandoned free water restriction for BP maintenance.
   - can recheck urine lytes if worsening.
   - worry that hypertonic saline may worsen his ascites so avoid for now.
   .
   # hyperkalemia -- getting kayexylate.
   .
   # Pain control: abd pain likely from ascites.  will try to minimize
   fluid intake.  morphine and oxycodone prn
   .
   # Ascites: likely from HCC and IVF.  Also worry about SBP given risk
   factors and elevated WBC.
   - will favor adding one dose vanco to his ceftriaxone given elevated
   wbc and persistent fevers.
   - albumin/octreotide/midodrine as above
   .
   # Other ID: has completed azithro for ? PNA.  continue ceftriaxone.
   f/u cx.
   .
   # HCC: unclear if patient medically stable for chemo at this time.
   will need to meet with primary onc and family to discuss plans.
   - Mixsad to come by today to talk with family. Plan interpreter to be

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The 72-year-old male patient with progressive HCC and multiple liver lesions was transferred to the ICU after an episode of BRBPR. He has been intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure due to mechanical factors, possibly related to his large belly and fluid relocation to the pleural space. His respiratory status has been compromised, and he has required increased oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's renal function has acutely worsened, with marginal urine output and likely acute tubular necrosis. He has been placed on a foley catheter and will be monitored for i/o and electrolyte imbalances. His liver function is also compromised, with elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes.

The patient has developed hyponatremia, likely due to total body water loss and intravascular dryness from liver disease. His potassium levels are elevated, and he has been started on kayexylate.

The patient's ascites is likely related to his HCC and IVF, and he has been prescribed albumin, octreotide, and midodrine to manage this condition. His pain control is being managed with morphine and oxycodone, and he has been placed on a bowel regimen to prevent constipation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count, liver enzymes, and LDH, indicating possible infection or inflammation. His imaging studies have revealed ascites and possibly fluid-filled lungs.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and he may develop further respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Renal failure: The patient's renal function has acutely worsened, and he may develop further kidney damage if not managed properly.
3. Liver failure: The patient's liver function is compromised, and he may develop further liver damage if not managed properly.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and liver enzymes suggest possible infection or inflammation, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid management is critical, and he may develop further fluid overload if not managed properly.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are imbalanced, and he may develop further electrolyte disturbances if not managed properly.
7. Pain management: The patient's pain control is being managed with morphine and oxycodone, but he may require further pain management if his condition worsens.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory, renal, and liver functions, as well as his electrolyte and fluid balances."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best.

Chief Complaint:  lower GI Bleed
   24 Hour Events:
   72yo man w progressive HCC with mx liver lesions and [**Hospital 90**] transferred to
   the ICU after episode of BRBPR.
   --Consults from Liver, [**Doctor First Name **] and Renal.  Deferred further investigation
   of LGIB.  Thought to be secondary to hemorrhoids.
   -- PARACENTESIS - At [**2122-6-28**] 06:56 PM - done for diagnostic purposes
   to dx abdominal mets vs. portal HTN vs. SBP. Shows SAAG 1.1 and Polys
   440, cx and cytology pending.
   -- Yesterday late afternoon/evening - notified of low UOP.  Thought was
   foley cath obstructed & not draining.  The cath was flushed with no
   result.  Bladder scan showed 480 cc urine in bladder.  Foley was pulled
   Cadey cath ordered.  Could not be placed by nursing.  Urology consult
   -- cystocopy showed pt was aneuric with contracted bladder.
   -- Approx 1 hour after cystocopy, the patient developed severe dyspnea
   and required 2L of O2.  The patient was given an aerosolized saline tx
   to help with secretions.  It became apparent that SOB was worsening
   thought to be mechanical due to worsening ascites and .  Patient became
   diaphoretic, cold and clammy.
   --ABG was done PH 7.2  O2 78  CO2 40  HCO3 16  XS -11
   --Decision made to intubate for hypoxic respiratory failure.
   --Patient placed on fentanyl and versed and was bolused approx 2 liters
   of fluid.  He became hypotensive to SBPs in 70s after intubation.
   -- He has required dopamine currently at 10 to maintain MAP >60
   -- Patient
s urine output increased to 20-30cc/hr with IVF boluses.
   --Recently his Vent Peak pressures have been increasing PIP 40, plat
   35.  Decreased TV, Increased RR and Increased PEEP.
   --Attempted A-line -- could not do.  2 peripheral IVs
   --daughter came by around the time the patient was intubated.  request
   family mtg with onc today.
   --Bladder scan at 36.

   ICU Care
 see above
   Vent orders and nursing orders specific to ventilated patients  placed<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old man with progressive liver cancer and multiple liver lesions who was admitted to the ICU after an episode of bleeding and respiratory failure. The patient has undergone several procedures, including paracentesis, cystoscopy, and intubation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on a ventilator due to hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely caused by increasing fluid in the interstitium in the lungs. The patient's ascites may be contributing to this condition, and there is a possibility of fluid relocation to the pleural space.
* Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's kidney function is worsening, with minimal urine output and increased serum creatinine levels. The etiology of ARF is multifactorial, including contrast nephropathy, pre-renal element, increasing abdominal pressure, and possibly hepatorenal syndrome.
* Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and responsive to fluids and dopamine. Central access is needed to continue giving pressors.
* Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient is at risk for SBP, and coverage with ceftriaxone is recommended.
* Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which is likely due to total body water depletion and intravascular volume depletion caused by liver disease.
* Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia, which is being treated with kayexylate.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.8 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 17.7 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count: 237 x 10^9/L
* Blood urea nitrogen: 118 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 3.8 mg/dL
* Alanine aminotransferase: 68 IU/L
* Aspartate aminotransferase: 127 IU/L
* Alkaline phosphatase: 30.5 IU/L
* Total bilirubin: 15.7 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: Bilateral increased interstitial markings at the lung bases.

The patient's medications include:

* Midazolam (Versed): 1 mg/hour
* Fentanyl: 50 mcg/hour
* Dopamine: 5 mcg/kg/min
* Pantoprazole (Protonix): [**2122-6-28**] 08:30 PM
* Morphine sulfate: [**2122-6-28**] 11:00 PM
* Kayexylate: [**2122-6-29**] 01:55 AM

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing intubation and sedation on a ventilator
* Titrating up FiO2 to maintain a PaO2 of 55
* Obtaining sputum cultures
* Repeating attempts at inserting an arterial line
* Considering dialysis if the patient has an acute indication
* Avoiding nephrotoxins and renally dosing drugs
* Placing a foley catheter
* Monitoring I/O and electrolytes
* Continuing albumin, midodrine, and octreotide to treat hepatorenal syndrome
* Performing a therapeutic paracentesis to remove approximately 1 L of ascites
* Repeating renal ultrasound today
* Discussing the patient's care with the primary oncologist and family today

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening respiratory failure due to increasing fluid in the interstitium in the lungs
* Progression of ARF to acute tubular necrosis or chronic kidney disease
* Development of SBP or spontaneous peritonitis
* Worsening hyponatremia or hyperkalemia
* Hepatorenal syndrome worsening with removal of fluid
* Infection or sepsis
* Hemorrhagic complications due to the patient's bleeding disorder
* Constipation or bowel obstruction due to the patient's underlying liver disease."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on ventilator support due to hypoxemic respiratory failure, which may worsen due to increasing fluid in the interstitium in the lungs.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's renal function is acutely worsening, with multifactorial etiology including contrast nephropathy, pre-renal element, increasing abdominal pressure, and possibly hepatorenal syndrome.
3. Hypotension: The patient is minimally responsive to fluids and dopamine, which may worsen due to ongoing bleeding and fluid shifts.
4. Bleeding: The patient has rectal prolapse and is suspected to have a lower source of bleeding, which may worsen due to ongoing bleeding and fluid shifts.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has total body water depletion likely due to liver disease, which may worsen due to ongoing fluid shifts and bleeding.
6. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia, which may worsen due to ongoing kidney injury and electrolyte imbalances.
7. Pain: The patient is sedated, and pain control measures may be inadequate, which may worsen due to ongoing bleeding and discomfort.
8. Infection: The patient has a history of antibiotic use, and there is a risk of developing an infection, particularly in the respiratory and urinary tracts.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may worsen due to ongoing bleeding and platelet consumption.
10. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, which may worsen due to ongoing bleeding and liver dysfunction.

The patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and stabilization are necessary to prevent further complications. The patient's family has made the decision not to escalate care, and the goal is to provide comfort care and support the patient's quality of life."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old man with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) admitted to the ICU for progressive respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (ARF), hypotension, and bleeding rectal prolapse. He is intubated and sedated on mechanical ventilation for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's ascites may be contributing to fluid relocation to the pleural space. He has worsening ARF with minimal urine output, and his creatinine is increasing. He is also experiencing hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypotension, which are being managed with fluids, dopamine, and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to increasing fluid in the interstitium in the lungs, which may be caused by the patient's ascites or other underlying conditions.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's ARF is multifactorial, including contrast nephropathy, pre-renal element, increasing abdominal pressure, and possibly hepatorenal syndrome. The patient's creatinine is increasing, and he is at risk of developing further kidney damage.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is responsive to fluids and dopamine, but he requires central access to continue receiving these medications.
4. Bleeding Rectal Prolapse: The patient's bleeding rectal prolapse may be caused by lower gastrointestinal bleeding, and he is at risk of further bleeding complications.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may worsen if he continues to lose sodium, and he may require further management to correct this electrolyte imbalance.
6. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia may require further management, including the use of medications such as kayexylate, to correct this electrolyte imbalance.
7. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's worsening liver disease may be contributing to his ARF, and he is at risk of developing further kidney damage.
8. Infection: The patient's respiratory failure and bleeding rectal prolapse make him at risk of developing infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
9. Cardiac Complications: The patient's hypotension and hypoxemia may increase his risk of cardiac complications, including cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure."
