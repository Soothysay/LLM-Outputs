   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems, mild hypertension
   and dyslipidemia, presents with his first symptomatic ischemic episdose
   with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels.
   PLAN
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Catheterization reveals significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and
   LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given extensive disease,
   the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG
   changed likely derived from occluded LCx. After recovery from this
   procedure, CABG will likely be considered.
   - Stop Plavix given likely surgery
   - Continue integrillin for 18 hours, or until surgery (switching off
   3-4 hours before surgery)
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg QD
   - Morphine 2-4 mg Q4H PRN pain
   - Check A1c - pnd

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old man who presented with his first symptomatic ischemic episode with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels. He was admitted to the ICU with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and was started on various medications, including heparin, amiodarone, and eptifibatide. He underwent cardiac catheterization and stent placement to the left circumflex artery (LCx). The patient is a candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and is being considered for surgery.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 88/53 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He has a regular sinus rhythm with frequent ectopy. His physical examination is significant for diffuse crackles in both lung fields, good air entry, and chest expansion. He has trophic changes at the ankles, hair loss, and shiny skin over the feet.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, with a peak level of 2.56 ng/mL. His creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 26 mg/dL. His complete blood count (CBC) shows leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 22.9 K/uL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient is at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's diffuse crackles in both lung fields may indicate pulmonary edema, which can lead to respiratory failure.
3. Renal complications: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels may indicate acute kidney injury, which can lead to chronic kidney disease.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate an increased risk of neurological complications such as stroke or seizures.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an increased risk of infection.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents may increase his risk of bleeding complications.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's use of medications such as aspirin and heparin may increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Thrombotic complications: The patient's use of anticoagulants may increase his risk of thrombotic complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

Based on the patient's medical history and laboratory results, it is essential to monitor his condition closely and manage his medications and therapies accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   ASSESSMENT
   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems, mild hypertension
   and dyslipidemia, presents with his first symptomatic ischemic episdose
   with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels.
   PLAN
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Catheterization reveals significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and
   LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given extensive disease,
   the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG
   changed likely derived from occluded LCx. After recovery from this
   procedure, CABG will likely be considered.
   - Stop Plavix given likely surgery
   - Continue integrillin for 18 hours, or until surgery (switching off
   3-4 hours before surgery)
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg QD

   [**Name (NI) **] Fibrillation, Ventricular Tachycardia, Torsades du Pointes
     Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case
   (concern for MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7306**] stretch). It appeared responsible for
   hypotension, but hypotension continues despite resolution of AF
   however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered
   pressure. Cardioversion was desirable and successful in the cath. lab.
   Since that time, ventricular tachycardia and torsades du pointes have
   been more concerning. Given QTc prolongation amiodarone was initially
   avoided . Sedation and electrical cardioversion successful.
   - Start rate or rhythm control [**Doctor Last Name **], beta-blocker - defer given
   cardiogenic shock
   - No need for anticoagulation with warfarin given short time of AF
   - Monitor with telemetry overnight

   Hypertension/Hypotension
     Will not need to treat hypertension initially, given hypotension.
   Will restart HCTZ on DC. Hypotension, Rx initially with dopamine,
   electrical cardioversion and baloon pump.
   - Follow and monitor with telemetry
   - Pressors (preferably Levophed, dopamine) if required
   - Continue baloon pump overnight

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered
   pressure. Cardioversion was desirable and successful in the cath. lab.
   Since that time, ventricular tachycardia and torsades du pointes have
   been more concerning. Given QTc prolongation amiodarone was initially
   avoided . Sedation and electrical cardioversion successful.

Summary:

The patient, a 52-year-old male, is a candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) due to significant coronary disease involving all major vessels. He presented with his first symptomatic ischemic episode and underwent catheterization, which revealed significant RCA, LAD, and LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. He was started on IABP, and his rhythm has been unstable, with episodes of atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and torsades du pointes. He was treated with magnesium, calcium gluconate, and amiodarone, and his QTc prolongation was addressed. He is currently being monitored in the ICU with telemetry and is receiving dopamine and balloon pump support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac condition is unstable, and he is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's lung fields are congested, and he may be at risk for respiratory failure, particularly if his cardiac condition worsens.
3. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and he may be at risk for acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease if his cardiac condition worsens or if he develops sepsis.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's cardiac condition and potential for cardiogenic shock may lead to neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly in the ICU setting, and may develop sepsis or other infections.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's cardiac catheterization and potential for cardiogenic shock may lead to bleeding complications, particularly if he develops coagulopathy.
7. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he may be at risk for further hypotension, particularly if his cardiac condition worsens.
8. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, and he may be at risk for hyperkalemia, particularly if his cardiac condition worsens.
9. Metabolic complications: The patient's cardiac condition may lead to metabolic complications, such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, particularly if he develops sepsis or other infections.

Given the patient's unstable cardiac condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, cardiac rhythm, and laboratory values to identify any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent or manage them."

   ASSESSMENT
   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems, mild hypertension
   and dyslipidemia, presents with his first symptomatic ischemic episdose
   with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels.
   PLAN
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Catheterization reveals significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and
   LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given extensive disease,
   the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG
   changed likely derived from occluded LCx. After recovery from this
   procedure, CABG will likely be considered.
   - Stop Plavix given likely surgery
   - Continue integrillin for 18 hours, or until surgery (switching off
   3-4 hours before surgery)
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg QD
   - Morphine 2-4 mg Q4H PRN pain
   - Check A1c - pnd
   - Lipid panel (not checked for ~ 10 months) - pnd
   - ASA 325 QD EC
   - Echo when stable given concern for MR in context of MI
   - CSurg has been contact[**Name (NI) **] re CABG
 they follow
 we appreciate their
   input
   - Trend enzymes until peak and trend down
   [**Name (NI) **] Fibrillation, Ventricular Tachycardia, Torsades du Pointes
     Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case
   (concern for MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7306**] stretch). It appeared responsible for
   hypotension, but hypotension continues despite resolution of AF
   however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered
   pressure. Cardioversion was desirable and successful in the cath. lab.
   Since that time, ventricular tachycardia and torsades du pointes have
   been more concerning. Given QTc prolongation amiodarone was initially
   avoided for fear, apparently justified of torsades (given frequent
   ectopy). However, desire to avoid beta blocker, based on recent trial
   data with AMI patients, and very frequently falling pressure with
   ventricular tachycardia eventually led to us deciding upon amiodarone
   loading. This has indeed reduced VT and pads are on the patient if
   sustained torsades appears. If his pressure improves today, we may also
   use very small amount of beta-blocker. We will also continue to
   aggressively replete K and Mg and remove the Swan-Ganz line for fear
   that this could also trigger arrhythmias (although, so far, they do not
   appear to have right ventricular origin)
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Leave cardioversion pads in place
   - Start small dose of metoprolol if pressure permits
   - Remove Swan
   - Monitor with telemetry
   Hypertension/Hypotension
     Will not need to treat hypertension initially, given hypotension.
   Will reconsider antihypertensive regimen if indicated and depending on
   indications at discharge. Hypotension, Rx initially with dopamine,
   electrical cardioversion and baloon pump.
   - Continue balloon pump for now
 turn off for short periods [**Hospital1 7**] to
   evaluate pressure without
   - Follow Fick CI with mixed sat
   - Avoid pressors if possible, consider dobutamine as first line
   Leukocytosis
     Likely stress demargination in ACS. Cortisol quite elevated at 26 in
   the evening.
   - Follow
   Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia
   - Replete aggressively to ensure K does not even go below 4 and Mg
   stays above 2

   ASSESSMENT
   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems, mild hypertension
   and dyslipidemia, presents with his first symptomatic ischemic episdose
   with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels.
   PLAN
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Catheterization reveals significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and
   LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given extensive disease,
   the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG
   changed likely derived from occluded LCx. After recovery from this
   procedure, CABG will likely be considered.
   - Stop Plavix given likely surgery
   - Continue integrillin for 18 hours, or until surgery (switching off
   3-4 hours before surgery)
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg QD
   - Morphine 2-4 mg Q4H PRN pain
   - Check A1c - pnd
   - Lipid panel (not checked for ~ 10 months) - pnd
   - ASA 325 QD EC
   - Echo when stable given concern for MR in context of MI
   - CSurg has been contact[**Name (NI) **] re CABG
 they follow
 we appreciate their
   input
   - Trend enzymes until peak and trend down
   [**Name (NI) **] Fibrillation, Ventricular Tachycardia, Torsades du Pointes
     Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case
   (concern for MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7306**] stretch). It appeared responsible for
   hypotension, but hypotension continues despite resolution of AF
   however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered
   pressure. Cardioversion was desirable and successful in the cath. lab.
   Since that time, ventricular tachycardia and torsades du pointes have
   been more concerning. Given QTc prolongation amiodarone was initially
   avoided for fear, apparently justified of torsades (given frequent
   ectopy). However, desire to avoid beta blocker, based on recent trial
   data with AMI patients, and very frequently falling pressure with
   ventricular tachycardia eventually led to us deciding upon amiodarone
   loading. This has indeed reduced VT and pads are on the patient if
   sustained torsades appears. If his pressure improves today, we may also
   use very small amount of beta-blocker. We will also continue to
   aggressively replete K and Mg and remove the Swan-Ganz line for fear
   that this could also trigger arrhythmias (although, so far, they do not
   appear to have right ventricular origin)
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Leave cardioversion pads in place
   - Start small dose of metoprolol if pressure permits
   - Remove Swan
   - Monitor with telemetry
   Hypertension/Hypotension
     Will not need to treat hypertension initially, given hypotension.
   Will reconsider antihypertensive regimen if indicated and depending on
   indications at discharge. Hypotension, Rx initially with dopamine,
   electrical cardioversion and baloon pump.
   - Continue balloon pump for now
 turn off for short periods [**Hospital1 7**] to
   evaluate pressure without
   - Follow Fick CI with mixed sat
   - Avoid pressors if possible, consider dobutamine as first line
   Leukocytosis
     Likely stress demargination in ACS. Cortisol quite elevated at 26 in
   the evening.
   - Follow
   Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia
   - Replete aggressively to ensure K does not even go below 4 and Mg
   stays above 2

   - No IVFs (received 4.5 L overnight)
   ACCESS:
   - PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   - DVT ppx with heparin IV
   - Pain management with morphine

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) and significant coronary disease involving all major vessels. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, stent placement, and balloon pump insertion.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 88/53 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving medications for cardiac arrhythmias, including amiodarone, and is being closely monitored for any signs of hypotension or arrhythmias.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. The patient's creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels are within normal limits, and the patient is not showing any signs of kidney injury.

The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a normal sinus rhythm with frequent ectopy, and the patient's echocardiogram shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%.

The patient's medical history is significant for mild hypertension and dyslipidemia, and the patient is a candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and torsades du pointes, given the patient's underlying coronary disease and the use of medications such as amiodarone.
2. Hypotension: The patient is at risk for developing hypotension, given the patient's underlying cardiac disease and the use of medications such as amiodarone.
3. Kidney injury: The patient is at risk for developing kidney injury, given the patient's underlying cardiac disease and the use of medications such as amiodarone.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient is at risk for developing respiratory complications, given the patient's underlying cardiac disease and the use of medications such as amiodarone.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infection, given the patient's underlying cardiac disease and the use of medications such as amiodarone.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, and the patient is being closely monitored for any signs of complications."

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

Patient Summary:

* The patient is a 65-inch tall individual who has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
* The patient has been receiving treatment for the AMI, including intravenous medications such as magnesium, calcium gluconate, and metoprolol.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74-94 beats per minute, blood pressure of 71-98/53-65 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 16-27 inspirations per minute.
* The patient's oxygen saturation is 97%, and their cardiac index has improved since the initiation of treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and they may be at risk for hypotension, particularly if the cardiac index continues to improve.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has been experiencing numerous PVCs, NSVT, and torsades du pointes, which may be a sign of cardiac instability.
* Respiratory compromise: The patient's respiratory rate has been increasing, and they may be at risk for respiratory failure if their oxygen saturation levels decrease.
* Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin, which may increase their risk of bleeding.
* Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an infection.
* Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate renal insufficiency.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's potassium and magnesium levels are abnormal, which may indicate an electrolyte imbalance.

Given the patient's diagnosis and treatment, it is essential to monitor their condition closely and adjust their treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   ASSESSMENT
   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems presents with his
   first symptomatic ischemic episdose with significant coronary disease.
   PLAN
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Catheterization reveals significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and
   LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given extensive disease,
   the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG
   changed likely derived from occluded LCx. After recovery from this
   procedure, CABG will likely be considered.
   - Plavix 75 mg QD
   - Continue integrillin overnight for 18 hours
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg QD
   - Morphine 2-4 mg Q4H PRN pain
   - Check A1c
   - Lipid panel (not checked for ~ 10 months)
   - ASA 325 QD
   - Echo when stable, hopefully on Monday a.m. (not urgent - on baloon
   and Swan)
   - CSurg has been contact[**Name (NI) **] re CABG
   - [**Name (NI) **] enzymes until peak and [**Name (NI) **] down
   Atrial Fibrillation
     Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case.
   It is also somewhat atypical that it appears to be responsible for
   hypotension given broad patency of the RCA. Nonetheless, without
   additional explanation for hypotension, it was felt that cardioversion
   was desirable. Sedation and electrical cardioversion successful.
   - Start rate or rhythm control [**Doctor Last Name **], beta-blocker - defer given
   cardiogenic shock
   - No need for anticoagulation with warfarin given short time of AF
   - Monitor with telemetry overnight
   .
   Hypertension/Hypotension
     Will not need to treat hypertension initially, given hypotension.
   Will restart HCTZ on DC. Hypotension, Rx initially with dopamine,
   electrical cardioversion and baloon pump.
   - Follow and monitor with telemetry
   - Pressors (preferably Levophed, dopamine) if required
   - Continue baloon pump overnight
   Leukocytosis
     Likely stress demargination in ACS.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   ASSESSMENT
   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems, mild hypertension
   and dyslipidemia, presents with his first symptomatic ischemic episdose
   with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels.
   PLAN
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Catheterization reveals significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and
   LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given extensive disease,
   the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG
   changed likely derived from occluded LCx. After recovery from this
   procedure, CABG will likely be considered.
   - Stop Plavix given likely surgery
   - Continue integrillin for 18 hours, or until surgery (switching off
   3-4 hours before surgery)
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg QD
   - Morphine 2-4 mg Q4H PRN pain
   - Check A1c - pnd
   - Lipid panel (not checked for ~ 10 months) - pnd
   - ASA 325 QD EC
   - Echo when stable given concern for MR in context of MI
   - CSurg has been contact[**Name (NI) **] re CABG
 they follow
 we appreciate their
   input
   - Trend enzymes until peak and trend down
   [**Name (NI) **] Fibrillation, Ventricular Tachycardia, Torsades du Pointes
     Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case
   (concern for MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7306**] stretch). It appeared responsible for
   hypotension, but hypotension continues despite resolution of AF
   however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered
   pressure. Cardioversion was desirable and successful in the cath. lab.
   Since that time, ventricular tachycardia and torsades du pointes have
   been more concerning. Given QTc prolongation amiodarone was initially
   avoided for fear, apparently justified of torsades (given frequent
   ectopy). However, desire to avoid beta blocker, based on recent trial
   data with AMI patients, and very frequently falling pressure with
   ventricular tachycardia eventually led to us deciding upon amiodarone
   loading. This has indeed reduced VT and pads are on the patient if
   sustained torsades appears. If his pressure improves today, we may also
   use very small amount of beta-blocker. We will also continue to
   aggressively replete K and Mg and remove the Swan-Ganz line for fear
   that this could also trigger arrhythmias (although, so far, they do not
   appear to have right ventricular origin)
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Leave cardioversion pads in place
   - Start small dose of metoprolol if pressure permits
   - Remove Swan
   - Monitor with telemetry
   Hypertension/Hypotension
     Will not need to treat hypertension initially, given hypotension.
   Will reconsider antihypertensive regimen if indicated and depending on
   indications at discharge. Hypotension, Rx initially with dopamine,
   electrical cardioversion and baloon pump.
   - Continue balloon pump for now
 turn off for short periods [**Hospital1 7**] to
   evaluate pressure without
   - Follow Fick CI with mixed sat
   - Avoid pressors if possible, consider dobutamine as first line
   Leukocytosis
     Likely stress demargination in ACS. Cortisol quite elevated at 26 in
   the evening.
   - Follow
   Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia
   - Replete aggressively to ensure K does not even go below 4 and Mg
   stays above 2
   FEN:
   - No IVFs (received 4.5 L overnight)
   ACCESS:
   - PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   - DVT ppx with heparin IV
   - Pain management with morphine
   - Bowel regimen with colace and senna (standing)

   ASSESSMENT
   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems, mild hypertension
   and dyslipidemia, presents with his first symptomatic ischemic episdose
   with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels.
   PLAN
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Catheterization reveals significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and
   LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given extensive disease,
   the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG
   changed likely derived from occluded LCx. After recovery from this
   procedure, CABG will likely be considered.
   - Stop Plavix given likely surgery
   - Continue integrillin for 18 hours, or until surgery (switching off
   3-4 hours before surgery)
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg QD
   - Morphine 2-4 mg Q4H PRN pain
   - Check A1c - pnd

   - Trend enzymes until peak and trend down
   [**Name (NI) **] Fibrillation, Ventricular Tachycardia, Torsades du Pointes
     Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case
   (concern for MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7306**] stretch). It appeared responsible for
   hypotension, but hypotension continues despite resolution of AF
   however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered
   pressure. Cardioversion was desirable and successful in the cath. lab.
   Since that time, ventricular tachycardia and torsades du pointes have
   been more concerning. Given QTc prolongation amiodarone was initially
   avoided for fear, apparently justified of torsades (given frequent
   ectopy). However, desire to avoid beta blocker, based on recent trial
   data with AMI patients, and very frequently falling pressure with
   ventricular tachycardia eventually led to us deciding upon amiodarone
   loading. This has indeed reduced VT and pads are on the patient if
   sustained torsades appears. If his pressure improves today, we may also
   use very small amount of beta-blocker. We will also continue to
   aggressively replete K and Mg and remove the Swan-Ganz line for fear
   that this could also trigger arrhythmias (although, so far, they do not
   appear to have right ventricular origin)
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Leave cardioversion pads in place
   - Start small dose of metoprolol if pressure permits
   - Remove Swan
   - Monitor with telemetry
   Hypertension/Hypotension
     Will not need to treat hypertension initially, given hypotension.
   Will reconsider antihypertensive regimen if indicated and depending on
   indications at discharge. Hypotension, Rx initially with dopamine,
   electrical cardioversion and baloon pump.
   - Continue balloon pump for now
 turn off for short periods [**Hospital1 7**] to

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 6706**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 31**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4847**], MD

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old man admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). He has significant coronary disease involving all major vessels and has undergone coronary angiography with stent placement to the left circumflex artery. The patient is a candidate for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) surgery.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T=37.2°C, HR=74 bpm, BP=88/53 mmHg, RR=16 breaths/min, SpO2=97%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP=9 mmHg, PAP=(34/18) mmHg, CO/CI=(5.2 L/min)/(2.8 L/min/m2)
* Laboratory results: WBC=22.8 K/uL, Hct=40.6%, Plt=246 K/uL, Cr=0.9 mg/dL, TropT=2.56 ng/mL, Glucose=125 mg/dL
* ECG: Normalized from pre-cath EKG
* Imaging: CXR shows vascular congestion and edema in both lung fields with no effusions

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition and treatment plan include:

* Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and torsades du pointes, and is at risk for further arrhythmias due to his underlying cardiac condition and medications.
* Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension despite treatment with dopamine and balloon pump, and may require further management with pressors or other medications.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's CXR shows vascular congestion and edema in both lung fields, which may indicate respiratory failure or impending respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient has a history of leukocytosis, which may be indicative of an underlying infection or inflammatory response.
* Bleeding: The patient has been treated with anticoagulation therapy, which may increase his risk of bleeding complications.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate renal impairment or failure.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Aggressive repletion of potassium and magnesium levels
* Continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm and hemodynamic status
* Use of medications to manage arrhythmias and hypotension
* Consideration of CABG surgery
* Monitoring for signs of respiratory failure or sepsis
* Close monitoring of renal function and blood pressure

The patient's code status is full code, and he has a living will and health care proxy in place."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   ASSESSMENT
   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems, mild hypertension
   and dyslipidemia, presents with his first symptomatic ischemic episdose
   with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels.
   PLAN
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Catheterization reveals significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and
   LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given extensive disease,
   the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG
   changed likely derived from occluded LCx. After recovery from this
   procedure, CABG will likely be considered. CK and CKNB have peaked and
   TT likely near. Other risk factor was likely cold
 [**12-28**] x RR of AMI in
   this context. CSurg deferred now.
   - Defer CABG by one month, allowing endothelium to appear within stent,
   protecting if LCx bypassed
   - Restart Plavix in a.m. after Prasugrel
   - Stop Integrillin
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg QD
   - Morphine 2-4 mg Q4H PRN pain
   - Check A1c - pnd
   - Lipid panel WNL, but aggressive lipid lowering with high dose statin
   indicated
   - ASA 325 QD EC
   - Echo when stable given concern for MR in context of MI
   - CSurg has been contact[**Name (NI) **] re CABG
 they follow
 we appreciate their
   input
   - Trend enzymes until peak and trend down
   [**Name (NI) **] Fibrillation, Ventricular Tachycardia, Torsades du Pointes
     Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case
   (concern for MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7306**] stretch). It appeared responsible for
   hypotension, but hypotension continues despite resolution of AF
   however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered
   pressure. Cardioversion was desirable and successful in the cath. lab.
   Since that time, ventricular tachycardia and torsades du pointes have
   been more concerning. Given QTc prolongation amiodarone was initially
   avoided for fear, apparently justified of torsades (given frequent
   ectopy). However, desire to avoid beta blocker, based on recent trial
   data with AMI patients, and very frequently falling pressure with
   ventricular tachycardia eventually led to us deciding upon amiodarone
   loading. This has indeed reduced VT and pads are on the patient if
   sustained torsades appears. If his pressure improves today, we may also
   use very small amount of beta-blocker. We will also continue to
   aggressively replete K and Mg and remove the Swan-Ganz line for fear
   that this could also trigger arrhythmias (although, so far, they do not
   appear to have right ventricular origin)
 now removed. Much less
   ectopy and VT now, likely due to being beyond the window of reperfusion
   ectopy.
   - Stop Amiodarone, per EP
   - EP consult prior to DC
   - Leave cardioversion pads in place
   - Metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg PO BID
   - Monitor with telemetry
   Hypertension/Hypotension
     Will not need to treat hypertension initially, given hypotension.
   Will reconsider antihypertensive regimen if indicated and depending on
   indications at discharge. Hypotension, Rx initially with dopamine,
   electrical cardioversion and baloon pump.
   - Continue balloon pump for now
 turn off for short periods [**Hospital1 7**] to
   evaluate pressure without. Likely volume up but will allow to
   autodiurese today and not use Lasix until after settled with balloon
   pump removal. Also CVP not very high, just PA pressure.
   - Avoid pressors if possible, consider dobutamine as first line if
   necessary
   Leukocytosis
     Likely stress demargination in ACS
 has resolved as would be
   consistent with this. Cortisol quite elevated at 26 on the evening of
   presentation.
   - Follow
   Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia
   - Replete aggressively to ensure K does not even go below 4 and Mg
   stays above 2

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 6706**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 31**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4847**], MD
   on:[**2158-3-7**] 10:45 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of mild hypertension and dyslipidemia, who presented with his first symptomatic ischemic episode with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels. He underwent catheterization and stent placement to the LCx, and is a candidate for CABG. The patient's condition has improved with the removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter and the placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, and blood pressure of 86/40 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 100%. He has diffuse crackles in both lung fields, but no wheeze.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, with a peak value of 8.25 ng/mL. His creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB levels have peaked and are trending down. His lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level is 478 IU/L, and his calcium and magnesium levels are within normal range.

The patient's ECG shows a sinus rhythm with frequent ectopy, and his telemetry monitoring shows a marked reduction in ventricular tachycardia and ectopy.

The patient's plan includes deferring CABG for one month, allowing the endothelium to appear within the stent and protecting the LCx if bypassed. He will be restarted on Plavix and Atorvastatin, and will have his lipid panel checked. He will also be monitored for hypertension and hypotension, and will have his A1c and lipid panel checked.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's ECG shows a sinus rhythm with frequent ectopy, and his telemetry monitoring shows a marked reduction in ventricular tachycardia and ectopy. However, the patient is at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, particularly ventricular tachycardia and torsades de pointes, due to his underlying coronary disease and the use of certain medications.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's chest X-ray shows diffuse airspace opacities suggestive of pulmonary edema. This can lead to respiratory failure and require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his underlying coronary disease and the use of invasive procedures. He will require close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, chills, and leukocytosis.
4. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to his underlying coronary disease and the use of anticoagulant medications. He will require close monitoring for signs of bleeding, such as hematuria, melena, and petechiae.
5. Renal failure: The patient is at risk for renal failure due to his underlying coronary disease and the use of certain medications. He will require close monitoring of his renal function, and may require dialysis if his renal function declines.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is stable, but he is at risk for various medical complications. Close monitoring and management of his condition will be necessary to prevent these complications and ensure his optimal recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-inch tall individual who presented with a STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) and was admitted to the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 86/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm. The Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed, and the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) has been pulled back approximately 2 cm.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating myocardial infarction. The patient's white blood cell count is 22.8, and the platelet count is 70. The patient's creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL, and the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 26 mg/dL. The patient's glucose level is 125 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies show improvement of the diffuse airspace opacities suggestive of improving pulmonary edema. However, there remains more prominent confluent opacity within the right perihilar region.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's STEMI may lead to cardiac complications such as ventricular tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's pulmonary edema may lead to respiratory complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure.
3. Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine level and BUN level may indicate renal compromise, which may lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
4. Infectious complications: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and invasive lines may increase the risk of infectious complications such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's bleeding risk is increased due to the use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, which may lead to hemorrhagic complications such as bleeding from the IABP site or gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and sedation may increase the risk of neurological complications such as delirium, cognitive impairment, and seizures.
7. Nutritional complications: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and inability to eat may lead to nutritional deficiencies and malnutrition."

   ASSESSMENT
   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems, mild hypertension
   and dyslipidemia, presents with his first symptomatic ischemic episdose
   with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels.
   PLAN
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Catheterization reveals significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and
   LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given extensive disease,
   the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG
   changed likely derived from occluded LCx. After recovery from this
   procedure, CABG will likely be considered. CK and CKNB have peaked and
   TT likely near.
   - Hold Plavix given likely surgery
   - Continue Integrillin for 18 hours, or until surgery (switching off
   3-4 hours before surgery)
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg QD
   - Morphine 2-4 mg Q4H PRN pain
   - Check A1c - pnd
   - Lipid panel WNL, but aggressive lipid lowering with high dose statin
   indicated
   - ASA 325 QD EC
   - Echo when stable given concern for MR in context of MI
   - CSurg has been contact[**Name (NI) **] re CABG
 they follow
 we appreciate their
   input
   - Trend enzymes until peak and trend down
   [**Name (NI) **] Fibrillation, Ventricular Tachycardia, Torsades du Pointes
     Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case
   (concern for MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7306**] stretch). It appeared responsible for
   hypotension, but hypotension continues despite resolution of AF
   however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered
   pressure. Cardioversion was desirable and successful in the cath. lab.
   Since that time, ventricular tachycardia and torsades du pointes have
   been more concerning. Given QTc prolongation amiodarone was initially
   avoided for fear, apparently justified of torsades (given frequent
   ectopy). However, desire to avoid beta blocker, based on recent trial
   data with AMI patients, and very frequently falling pressure with
   ventricular tachycardia eventually led to us deciding upon amiodarone
   loading. This has indeed reduced VT and pads are on the patient if
   sustained torsades appears. If his pressure improves today, we may also
   use very small amount of beta-blocker. We will also continue to
   aggressively replete K and Mg and remove the Swan-Ganz line for fear
   that this could also trigger arrhythmias (although, so far, they do not
   appear to have right ventricular origin)
 now removed
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Leave cardioversion pads in place
   - Metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg PO BID
   - Monitor with telemetry
   Hypertension/Hypotension
     Will not need to treat hypertension initially, given hypotension.
   Will reconsider antihypertensive regimen if indicated and depending on
   indications at discharge. Hypotension, Rx initially with dopamine,
   electrical cardioversion and baloon pump.
   - Continue balloon pump for now
 turn off for short periods [**Hospital1 7**] to
   evaluate pressure without
   - Follow Fick CI with mixed sat
   - Avoid pressors if possible, consider dobutamine as first line if
   necessary
   Leukocytosis
     Likely stress demargination in ACS
 has resolved as would be
   consistent with this. Cortisol quite elevated at 26 on the evening of
   presentation.
   - Follow
   Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   ASSESSMENT
   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems, mild hypertension
   and dyslipidemia, presents with his first symptomatic ischemic episdose
   with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels.
   PLAN
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Catheterization reveals significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and
   LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given extensive disease,
   the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG
   changed likely derived from occluded LCx. After recovery from this
   procedure, CABG will likely be considered. CK and CKNB have peaked and
   TT likely near.
   - Hold Plavix given likely surgery
   - Continue Integrillin for 18 hours, or until surgery (switching off
   3-4 hours before surgery)
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg QD
   - Morphine 2-4 mg Q4H PRN pain
   - Check A1c - pnd
   - Lipid panel WNL, but aggressive lipid lowering with high dose statin
   indicated
   - ASA 325 QD EC
   - Echo when stable given concern for MR in context of MI
   - CSurg has been contact[**Name (NI) **] re CABG
 they follow
 we appreciate their
   input
   - Trend enzymes until peak and trend down
   [**Name (NI) **] Fibrillation, Ventricular Tachycardia, Torsades du Pointes
     Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case
   (concern for MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7306**] stretch). It appeared responsible for
   hypotension, but hypotension continues despite resolution of AF
   however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered
   pressure. Cardioversion was desirable and successful in the cath. lab.
   Since that time, ventricular tachycardia and torsades du pointes have
   been more concerning. Given QTc prolongation amiodarone was initially
   avoided for fear, apparently justified of torsades (given frequent
   ectopy). However, desire to avoid beta blocker, based on recent trial
   data with AMI patients, and very frequently falling pressure with
   ventricular tachycardia eventually led to us deciding upon amiodarone
   loading. This has indeed reduced VT and pads are on the patient if
   sustained torsades appears. If his pressure improves today, we may also
   use very small amount of beta-blocker. We will also continue to
   aggressively replete K and Mg and remove the Swan-Ganz line for fear
   that this could also trigger arrhythmias (although, so far, they do not
   appear to have right ventricular origin)
 now removed
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Leave cardioversion pads in place
   - Metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg PO BID
   - Monitor with telemetry
   Hypertension/Hypotension
     Will not need to treat hypertension initially, given hypotension.
   Will reconsider antihypertensive regimen if indicated and depending on
   indications at discharge. Hypotension, Rx initially with dopamine,
   electrical cardioversion and baloon pump.
   - Continue balloon pump for now
 turn off for short periods [**Hospital1 7**] to
   evaluate pressure without
   - Follow Fick CI with mixed sat
   - Avoid pressors if possible, consider dobutamine as first line if
   necessary
   Leukocytosis
     Likely stress demargination in ACS
 has resolved as would be
   consistent with this. Cortisol quite elevated at 26 on the evening of
   presentation.
   - Follow
   Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia
   - Replete aggressively to ensure K does not even go below 4 and Mg
   stays above 2

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

Patient's Condition:

* The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of mild hypertension and dyslipidemia who presented with a STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction).
* He underwent catheterization and stent placement to the LCx, and is a candidate for CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting) due to extensive coronary disease.
* The patient has been experiencing symptomatic ischemia, and his EKG has changed, likely due to occluded LCx.
* He has been treated with Integrillin, amiodarone, and metoprolol, and is currently being monitored for cardiac arrhythmias.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has been experiencing ventricular tachycardia, torsades du pointes, and atrial fibrillation, which can lead to hypotension and decreased cardiac output.
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and he is at risk of developing hypotension, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
* Respiratory complications: The patient has diffuse crackles in both lung fields, which can indicate pulmonary edema, and may require mechanical ventilation.
* Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and he is at risk of developing acute kidney injury.
* Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, and is at risk of developing bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
* Infection: The patient has a central line and is at risk of developing catheter-related bloodstream infections.
* Thrombosis: The patient has been treated with anticoagulation therapy, and is at risk of developing thrombosis, particularly in the legs.

Recommendations:

* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and blood pressure, and adjust therapy as necessary.
* Consider adding a beta blocker to the patient's medication regimen to help control his heart rate and blood pressure.
* Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
* Consider adding anticoagulation therapy to the patient's regimen to prevent thrombosis.
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider mechanical ventilation if necessary.
* Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's regimen if he develops a fever or other signs of infection.
* Monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust his anticoagulation therapy accordingly."

   The Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed. There remains an intra-aortic
   balloon pump which has been pulled back approximately 2 cm. There has
   been improvement of the diffuse airspace opacities since the prior
   study suggestive of improving pulmonary edema given its quick
   resolution. There remains more prominent confluent opacity within the

   ASSESSMENT
   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems, mild hypertension
   and dyslipidemia, presents with his first symptomatic ischemic episdose
   with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels.
   PLAN
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Catheterization reveals significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and
   LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given extensive disease,
   the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG
   changed likely derived from occluded LCx. After recovery from this
   procedure, CABG will likely be considered. CK and CKNB have peaked and
   TT likely near. Other risk factor was likely cold
 [**12-28**] x RR of AMI in
   this context. CSurg deferred now.
   - Defer CABG by one month, allowing endothelium to appear within stent,
   protecting if LCx bypassed
   - Restart Plavix in a.m. after Prasugrel
   - Stop Integrillin
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg QD
   - Morphine 2-4 mg Q4H PRN pain
   - Check A1c - pnd
   - Lipid panel WNL, but aggressive lipid lowering with high dose statin
   indicated
   - ASA 325 QD EC
   - Echo when stable given concern for MR in context of MI
   - CSurg has been contact[**Name (NI) **] re CABG
 they follow
 we appreciate their
   input
   - Trend enzymes until peak and trend down
   [**Name (NI) **] Fibrillation, Ventricular Tachycardia, Torsades du Pointes
     Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case
   (concern for MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7306**] stretch). It appeared responsible for
   hypotension, but hypotension continues despite resolution of AF
   however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered
   pressure. Cardioversion was desirable and successful in the cath. lab.
   Since that time, ventricular tachycardia and torsades du pointes have
   been more concerning. Given QTc prolongation amiodarone was initially
   avoided for fear, apparently justified of torsades (given frequent
   ectopy). However, desire to avoid beta blocker, based on recent trial
   data with AMI patients, and very frequently falling pressure with
   ventricular tachycardia eventually led to us deciding upon amiodarone
   loading. This has indeed reduced VT and pads are on the patient if
   sustained torsades appears. If his pressure improves today, we may also
   use very small amount of beta-blocker. We will also continue to
   aggressively replete K and Mg and remove the Swan-Ganz line for fear
   that this could also trigger arrhythmias (although, so far, they do not
   appear to have right ventricular origin)
 now removed. Much less
   ectopy and VT now, likely due to being beyond the window of reperfusion
   ectopy.
   - Stop Amiodarone, per EP
   - EP consult prior to DC
   - Leave cardioversion pads in place
   - Metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg PO BID
   - Monitor with telemetry
   Hypertension/Hypotension
     Will not need to treat hypertension initially, given hypotension.
   Will reconsider antihypertensive regimen if indicated and depending on
   indications at discharge. Hypotension, Rx initially with dopamine,
   electrical cardioversion and baloon pump.
   - Continue balloon pump for now
 turn off for short periods [**Hospital1 7**] to
   evaluate pressure without. Likely volume up but will allow to
   autodiurese today and not use Lasix until after settled with balloon
   pump removal. Also CVP not very high, just PA pressure.
   - Avoid pressors if possible, consider dobutamine as first line if
   necessary
   Leukocytosis
     Likely stress demargination in ACS
 has resolved as would be
   consistent with this. Cortisol quite elevated at 26 on the evening of
   presentation.
   - Follow
   Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia
   - Replete aggressively to ensure K does not even go below 4 and Mg
   stays above 2

   ASSESSMENT
   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems, mild hypertension
   and dyslipidemia, presents with his first symptomatic ischemic episdose
   with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels.
   PLAN
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Catheterization reveals significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and
   LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given extensive disease,
   the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG
   changed likely derived from occluded LCx. After recovery from this
   procedure, CABG will likely be considered. CK and CKNB have peaked and
   TT likely near. Other risk factor was likely cold
 [**12-28**] x RR of AMI in
   this context. CSurg deferred now.
   - Defer CABG by one month, allowing endothelium to appear within stent,
   protecting if LCx bypassed

   - CSurg has been contact[**Name (NI) **] re CABG
 they follow
 we appreciate their
   input
   - Trend enzymes until peak and trend down
   [**Name (NI) **] Fibrillation, Ventricular Tachycardia, Torsades du Pointes
     Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case
   (concern for MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7306**] stretch). It appeared responsible for
   hypotension, but hypotension continues despite resolution of AF
   however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered
   pressure. Cardioversion was desirable and successful in the cath. lab.
   Since that time, ventricular tachycardia and torsades du pointes have
   been more concerning. Given QTc prolongation amiodarone was initially
   avoided for fear, apparently justified of torsades (given frequent
   ectopy). However, desire to avoid beta blocker, based on recent trial
   data with AMI patients, and very frequently falling pressure with
   ventricular tachycardia eventually led to us deciding upon amiodarone
   loading. This has indeed reduced VT and pads are on the patient if
   sustained torsades appears. If his pressure improves today, we may also
   use very small amount of beta-blocker. We will also continue to
   aggressively replete K and Mg and remove the Swan-Ganz line for fear
   that this could also trigger arrhythmias (although, so far, they do not
   appear to have right ventricular origin)
 now removed. Much less
   ectopy and VT now, likely due to being beyond the window of reperfusion
   ectopy.
   - Stop Amiodarone, per EP
   - EP consult prior to DC
   - Leave cardioversion pads in place
   - Metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg PO BID
   - Monitor with telemetry
   Hypertension/Hypotension
     Will not need to treat hypertension initially, given hypotension.
   Will reconsider antihypertensive regimen if indicated and depending on
   indications at discharge. Hypotension, Rx initially with dopamine,
   electrical cardioversion and baloon pump.
   - Continue balloon pump for now
 turn off for short periods [**Hospital1 7**] to
   evaluate pressure without. Likely volume up but will allow to
   autodiurese today and not use Lasix until after settled with balloon
   pump removal. Also CVP not very high, just PA pressure.
   - Avoid pressors if possible, consider dobutamine as first line if
   necessary

 has resolved as would be
   consistent with this. Cortisol quite elevated at 26 on the evening of

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

* The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of mild hypertension and dyslipidemia, who presented with a first symptomatic ischemic episode with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels.
* The patient underwent catheterization and stent placement to the LCx, and is a candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
* The patient's condition has improved, with a reduction in ventricular tachycardia and ectopy, and a successful cardioversion.
* The patient is currently on the following medications: metoprolol, amiodarone, and morphine.
* The patient has a Swan-Ganz catheter removed, and an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) remains in place.
* The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, and his cardiac enzymes have peaked.
* The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is at risk for further cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia and torsades de pointes, due to his underlying coronary disease and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his prolonged ICU stay and the use of central lines and other invasive devices.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require mechanical ventilation if his oxygenation levels deteriorate.
4. Renal failure: The patient's electrolyte imbalances and hypovolemia may put him at risk for acute kidney injury or renal failure.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his prolonged ICU stay and the use of invasive devices.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents may put him at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's IABP may cause cardiac tamponade if it is not properly monitored and managed.
8. Pulmonary edema: The patient's underlying coronary disease and fluid overload may put him at risk for pulmonary edema.
9. Myocardial infarction: The patient is at risk for further myocardial infarction due to his underlying coronary disease and the use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents.
10. Stroke: The patient is at risk for stroke due to his underlying coronary disease and the use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: STEMI
   24 Hour Events:
 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2158-3-6**] 08:17 AM
   Akinetic region laterally with adjacent hypokinesis. Mild MR. LVEF
   40-45%.
 IABP LINE - STOP [**2158-3-6**] 03:18 PM
 SHEATH - STOP [**2158-3-6**] 03:20 PM
   - D/w EP who recommended stopping amiodarone and observing to see if
   there is further VT, ectopy - if so can always restart. They agree with
   low-dose beta-clocker. They ask that we consult EP before he leaves to
   tuck these issues in.
   - Echo shows lateral akinesis, LVEF 40-45%, 1+ MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 133**] need ACEi as BP
   can tolerate; did not start today as coming off IABP.
   - Prasugel given, Integrillin stopped, balloon removed, Plavix started.
   - [**Location (un) 4847**], [**Doctor Last Name 1931**], Mr and Mrs. [**Known lastname 14519**] discussed plan. Will go home

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old man with a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) and significant coronary disease involving all major vessels. He has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone various treatments, including IABP (intra-aortic balloon pump) and anticoagulation therapy. His current condition is stable, with a heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 94/68 mmHg, and SpO2 of 97%. He has mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with lateral akinesis and mild mitral regurgitation. His troponin levels are trending down, and he is expected to recover.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of STEMI and significant coronary disease, which may lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient has mild respiratory distress, which may worsen if he develops pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
3. Renal complications: The patient has mild azotemia, which may worsen if he develops acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient has been taking anticoagulation therapy, which may increase his risk of bleeding complications, such as hematomas or gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia, which may increase his risk of stroke or transient ischemic attacks.
6. Infection complications: The patient has a central line and may be at risk for central line-associated bloodstream infections.
7. Medication complications: The patient is taking multiple medications, including anticoagulation therapy, beta-blockers, and antiplatelet agents, which may interact with each other or increase his risk of adverse effects.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust his medications as necessary.
2. Consider transferring the patient to a cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CTICU) for further management of his cardiac condition.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider intubation if he develops respiratory distress.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider dialysis if he develops acute kidney injury.
5. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust his anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's neurological status and consider imaging studies if he develops symptoms of stroke or transient ischemic attacks.
7. Consider consulting infectious disease specialists if the patient develops an infection.
8. Consider consulting cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons for further management of the patient's cardiac condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-inch-tall individual who was admitted to the ICU with a STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction). They underwent IABP (intra-aortic balloon pump) and received prasugrel, integrillin, and Plavix. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, and blood pressure of 94/68 mmHg. The patient's heart rhythm is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their condition, and no assessments were made of their peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic status. The patient's lab results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating ongoing myocardial injury.

The patient's plan includes stopping amiodarone and observing for further ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ectopy, restarting low-dose beta-blocker, and consulting with an electrophysiologist before discharge. The patient will be transferred to the floor soon for about a month prior to surgery.

Potential medical complications:

1. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient's history of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and ongoing myocardial injury may increase their risk of developing ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation.
2. Myocardial infarction: The patient's ongoing myocardial injury may increase their risk of developing further myocardial infarction, particularly in the lateral wall.
3. Heart failure: The patient's reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and presence of mitral regurgitation (MR) may increase their risk of developing heart failure.
4. Bloodstream infections: The patient's indwelling lines and use of antibiotics may increase their risk of developing bloodstream infections.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory support and potential for aspiration may increase their risk of developing pneumonia.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's use of SQ UF heparin for DVT prophylaxis may not be sufficient to prevent DVT and PE.
7. Stress ulceration: The patient's use of PPI pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis may not be sufficient to prevent stress ulceration.
8. Vascular complications: The patient's use of IABP and presence of indwelling lines may increase their risk of developing vascular complications, including bleeding and thrombosis."

   Imaging:
   Pnd CXR this a.m.
   Echo:
   The left atrium is normal in size. No [**Telephone/Fax (3) 7306**] septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
   left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild to moderate
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with lateral akinesis.
   No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
   ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
   arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There
   is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Microbiology: None.
   ECG: No events.
   ASSESSMENT
   This 52-year-old man with few other medical problems, mild hypertension
   and dyslipidemia, presents with his first symptomatic ischemic episdose
   with significant coronary disease involving all major vessels.
   CAD
   Enzymes trending down now. Integrillin stopped and will wait for
   endothelium in stent for CABG.
   - Plavix [**Hospital1 7**] 1 wk, then QD
   - ASA 325 EC
   Heart Failure, systolic dysfunction
   Expect some recovery. Fluid balance still quite positive, 4.5 L since
   admission. Unlikely had this fluid deficit.
   - Consider diuresis today if CXR still looks wet
   Arhythmia
 AF, VT, torsades
   Unlikely torsades now much less ectopy. AF and VT gone now
   - Continue metoprolol and convert to succinate on DC
   Anemia
   From 38 to 33 now. No clear place for bleeding, but sheath removed.
   Dispo
   To floor today, perhaps home tomorrow.
   PLAN
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Catheterization reveals significant RCA, LAD (including diagonal)and
   LCx disease with stent placement to the LCx. Given extensive disease,
   the patient is a candidate for CABG. Symptomatic ischemia and EKG
   changed likely derived from occluded LCx. After recovery from this
   procedure, CABG will likely be considered. CK and CKNB have peaked and
   TT likely near. Other risk factor was likely cold
 [**12-28**] x RR of AMI in
   this context. CSurg deferred now.
   - Defer CABG by one month, allowing endothelium to appear within stent,
   protecting if LCx bypassed
   - Restart Plavix in a.m. after Prasugrel
   - Stop Integrillin
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg QD
   - Morphine 2-4 mg Q4H PRN pain
   - Check A1c - pnd
   - Lipid panel WNL, but aggressive lipid lowering with high dose statin
   indicated
   - ASA 325 QD EC
   - Echo when stable given concern for MR in context of MI
   - CSurg has been contact[**Name (NI) **] re CABG
 they follow
 we appreciate their
   input
   - Trend enzymes until peak and trend down
   [**Name (NI) **] Fibrillation, Ventricular Tachycardia, Torsades du Pointes
     Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case
   (concern for MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7306**] stretch). It appeared responsible for
   hypotension, but hypotension continues despite resolution of AF
   however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered
   pressure. Cardioversion was desirable and successful in the cath. lab.
   Since that time, ventricular tachycardia and torsades du pointes have
   been more concerning. Given QTc prolongation amiodarone was initially
   avoided for fear, apparently justified of torsades (given frequent
   ectopy). However, desire to avoid beta blocker, based on recent trial
   data with AMI patients, and very frequently falling pressure with
   ventricular tachycardia eventually led to us deciding upon amiodarone
   loading. This has indeed reduced VT and pads are on the patient if
   sustained torsades appears. If his pressure improves today, we may also
   use very small amount of beta-blocker. We will also continue to
   aggressively replete K and Mg and remove the Swan-Ganz line for fear
   that this could also trigger arrhythmias (although, so far, they do not
   appear to have right ventricular origin)
 now removed. Much less
   ectopy and VT now, likely due to being beyond the window of reperfusion
   ectopy.
   - Stop Amiodarone, per EP
   - EP consult prior to DC
   - Leave cardioversion pads in place
   - Metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg PO BID
   - Monitor with telemetry
   Hypertension/Hypotension
     Will not need to treat hypertension initially, given hypotension.
   Will reconsider antihypertensive regimen if indicated and depending on
   indications at discharge. Hypotension, Rx initially with dopamine,
   electrical cardioversion and baloon pump.
   - Continue balloon pump for now
 turn off for short periods [**Hospital1 7**] to
   evaluate pressure without. Likely volume up but will allow to
   autodiurese today and not use Lasix until after settled with balloon
   pump removal. Also CVP not very high, just PA pressure.
   - Avoid pressors if possible, consider dobutamine as first line if
   necessary
   Leukocytosis
     Likely stress demargination in ACS
 has resolved as would be
   consistent with this. Cortisol quite elevated at 26 on the evening of
   presentation.
   - Follow
   Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia
   - Replete aggressively to ensure K does not even go below 4 and Mg
   stays above 2

   - No IVFs (received 4.5 L overnight)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   [**Name (NI) **] Fibrillation, Ventricular Tachycardia, Torsades du Pointes
     Although atypical, AF appears to be an ischemic rhythm in this case
   (concern for MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7306**] stretch). It appeared responsible for
   hypotension, but hypotension continues despite resolution of AF
   however, each of the above rhythms is also associated with lowered
   pressure. Cardioversion was desirable and successful in the cath. lab.
   Since that time, ventricular tachycardia and torsades du pointes have
   been more concerning. Given QTc prolongation amiodarone was initially
   avoided for fear, apparently justified of torsades (given frequent
   ectopy). However, desire to avoid beta blocker, based on recent trial
   data with AMI patients, and very frequently falling pressure with
   ventricular tachycardia eventually led to us deciding upon amiodarone
   loading. This has indeed reduced VT and pads are on the patient if
   sustained torsades appears. If his pressure improves today, we may also
   use very small amount of beta-blocker. We will also continue to
   aggressively replete K and Mg and remove the Swan-Ganz line for fear
   that this could also trigger arrhythmias (although, so far, they do not
   appear to have right ventricular origin)
 now removed. Much less
   ectopy and VT now, likely due to being beyond the window of reperfusion
   ectopy.
   - Stop Amiodarone, per EP
   - EP consult prior to DC
   - Leave cardioversion pads in place
   - Metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg PO BID
   - Monitor with telemetry
   Hypertension/Hypotension
     Will not need to treat hypertension initially, given hypotension.
   Will reconsider antihypertensive regimen if indicated and depending on
   indications at discharge. Hypotension, Rx initially with dopamine,
   electrical cardioversion and baloon pump.
   - Continue balloon pump for now
 turn off for short periods [**Hospital1 7**] to
   evaluate pressure without. Likely volume up but will allow to
   autodiurese today and not use Lasix until after settled with balloon
   pump removal. Also CVP not very high, just PA pressure.
   - Avoid pressors if possible, consider dobutamine as first line if
   necessary
   Leukocytosis
     Likely stress demargination in ACS
 has resolved as would be
   consistent with this. Cortisol quite elevated at 26 on the evening of
   presentation.
   - Follow
   Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia
   - Replete aggressively to ensure K does not even go below 4 and Mg
   stays above 2

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of mild hypertension and dyslipidemia, who presented with his first symptomatic ischemic episode and significant coronary disease involving all major vessels. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement to the LCx and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.2°F, heart rate of 62 bpm, and blood pressure of 94/68 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, and his troponin level is 5.82 ng/mL. His electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a normal sinus rhythm with frequent ectopy.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and his coronary arteries are significantly diseased. He is a candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), but it has been deferred for one month to allow for endothelium to appear within the stent.

The patient's medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin. He is also receiving intravenous heparin and enoxaparin for anticoagulation.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 22.8 × 10^9/L, hemoglobin level of 11.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 166 × 10^9/L. His serum creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 12 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies show mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with lateral akinesis, and mild mitral regurgitation.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and torsades de pointes. He is at risk for developing further arrhythmias, particularly if his potassium and magnesium levels become imbalanced.
2. Heart failure: The patient has mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which may lead to heart failure if not managed properly.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a central line and is receiving intravenous antibiotics, which increases his risk of developing sepsis.
4. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which increases his risk of bleeding.
5. Kidney injury: The patient's serum creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate kidney injury.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Close monitoring of his cardiac enzymes and troponin levels to ensure that they are trending down.
2. Administration of anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombus formation.
3. Management of his cardiac arrhythmias with medications and cardioversion as necessary.
4. Treatment of his heart failure with medications and fluid management.
5. Monitoring of his kidney function and management of any kidney injury.
6. Deferment of CABG for one month to allow for endothelium to appear within the stent.
7. Restart of Plavix in the morning after Prasugrel.
8. Stop of Integrillin.
9. Atorvastatin 80 mg QD.
10. Morphine 2-4 mg Q4H PRN pain.
11. Check A1c - pnd.
12. Lipid panel WNL, but aggressive lipid lowering with high-dose statin indicated.
13. ASA 325 QD EC.
14. Echo when stable given concern for MR in context of MI.

The patient's family has been informed of his condition and has signed an ICU consent form. His code status is full code, and he will be transferred to the floor once he is stable."
