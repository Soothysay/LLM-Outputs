   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 69 year old morbidly obese male with a hx of DM, HTN,
   dyslipidemia, CAD presenting with decombensated heart failure and
   possible ACS vs. PE.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  EKG concerning for a STEMI with RCA lesion while on
   dobutamine last night.  CKs are flat and pt is unable to lay flat,
   requiring significant oxygen.  Now off Dobutamine and ECG changes
   resolved.
   -- will defer cath given difficulty laying flat and no acute infarct
   pattern currently.  Will continue to monitor ECGs and enzymes.  Will
   continue diuresis to optimize respiratory status prior to cath.
   -- cont ASA, plavix, and heparin (concern for PE)
   -- cont high dose statin
   -- d/c integrillin as no immediate plan to go to cath
   -- hold metoprolol in the setting of decompensated heart failure
   -- avoid nitrates with concern of IMI

   # PUMP:  Precipitous events of decompensated HF not particularly
   clear.  Recent chest pain, new TTE findings, and q-waves on EKG
   concerning for recent MI with worsening heart failure.  Cannot rule out
   possiblity of PE with exudate effusion.  Patient with elevated JVP,
   marked pulmonary edema/effusions, elevated BNP.  Unclear if there is an
   acute event that has worsened dyspnea, heart failure.   Pt responding

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease, presenting with decompensated heart failure and possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) versus pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37°C (98.6°F)
* Heart rate: 89 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 86/51 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Morbid obesity
* Tachypnea and diaphoresis
* Muffled heart sounds, difficult to auscultate
* Decreased breath sounds on the left and right sides, with rales up to the apex on the left and at the base on the right
* Marked stasis dermatitis on both lower extremities

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.4-12.2 K/μL
* Hematocrit: 31.5-31.1%
* Platelet count: 305-361 K/μL
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.10 ng/mL
* Glucose: 227 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results are also provided, including elevated levels of troponin-T, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Coronaries: EKG concerning for a STEMI with RCA lesion, but CKs are flat, and the patient is unable to lay flat, requiring significant oxygen. The plan is to defer catheterization and continue to monitor ECGs and enzymes.
* Pump: Precipitous events of decompensated HF not particularly clear, with recent chest pain, new TTE findings, and q-waves on EKG concerning for recent MI with worsening heart failure. The plan is to continue diuresis to optimize respiratory status prior to catheterization.
* Rhythm: Sinus tachycardia, likely secondary to decompensated heart failure and hypoxia. The plan is to continue to treat these potential underlying causes.
* Pulmonary effusion: Differential includes PE, PNA, or heart failure. The plan is to continue heparin gtt for possible PE, consider CTA to rule out PE, and diureisis as described above.
* Diabetes: On Lantus 10 units qday and insulin sliding scale, holding glyburide.
* Hypothyroidism: Continuing home Synthroid.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with possible ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
* Pulmonary embolism (PE) with possible right axis shift, hypoxia, and ST changes
* Decompensated heart failure with possible cardiogenic shock
* Respiratory failure with possible need for mechanical ventilation
* Sepsis with possible multi-organ dysfunction
* Metabolic complications such as hyperglycemia and electrolyte imbalances
* Thrombotic complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary thrombosis (PT)"

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD) presenting with decompensated heart failure and possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) versus pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 86/51 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His respiratory support includes a face tent with oxygen delivery, and his physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the left side, rales on the right side, and marked stasis dermatitis on both extremities.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, with a peak of 0.10 ng/mL, and a normal creatine kinase (CK) level. His electrocardiogram (EKG) shows ST elevations in lead III, which is concerning for a possible STEMI. His echocardiogram (TTE) reveals a reduced ejection fraction of 20%.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Coronaries: The patient's EKG shows evidence of a prior anteroseptal infarct, which is consistent with a new finding of reduced EF on TTE. He has no current complaints of chest pain, but his EKG is concerning for a STEMI. Cardiac catheterization was deferred due to the patient's decompensated heart failure.
2. Pump: The patient's decompensated heart failure is likely secondary to his CAD, but it is unclear if there is an acute event that has worsened his dyspnea and heart failure. He will be treated with IV lasix for diuresis and his beta-blocker will be held in the setting of decompensated HF.
3. Rhythm: The patient's sinus tachycardia is likely secondary to his decompensated heart failure and hypoxia. He will continue to be treated for these underlying causes.
4. Pulmonary Effusion: The patient's pulmonary effusion is likely secondary to his heart failure, but it is unexpected that the protein ratio is more consistent with an exudative process. PE is also a possible cause, which would unify the patient's right axis shift, hypoxia, and ST changes.
5. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes will be managed with lantus and sliding scale insulin while he is inpatient.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism will be managed with his home thyroid medication.
7. FEN: The patient will be NPO for now.
8. ACCESS: The patient will have PIVs.
9. PROPHYLAXIS: The patient will receive DVT prophylaxis with systemic heparin, pain management with tylenol, and bowel regimen with colace.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's sinus tachycardia and possible STEMI increase his risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's pulmonary effusion and right axis shift increase his risk of developing PE.
3. Worsening heart failure: The patient's decompensated heart failure may worsen if he does not receive adequate treatment.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's diabetes may worsen if he does not receive adequate treatment.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if he does not receive adequate treatment.

In conclusion, the patient is a high-risk individual who requires close monitoring and treatment for his decompensated heart failure, possible ACS, and pulmonary effusion."

   consistent w/ PE.  CKs are flat.  Pt. is significantly volume
   overloaded, continues to require oxygen, improved w/ diuresis.  Pt.
   continues to remain at high risk for PE given wt, sedentary lifestyle
   and relative immobility.  Pt. tolerated bbk well.
   -- will defer cath given flat enzymes.

   high risk for PE (per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2830**]
   -- cont high dose statin
   -- continue metoprolol given tachycardia and suspected demand
   -- avoid nitrates with concern of past IMI
   .
   # Pulmonary Effusion: Consistent w/ peri-pneumonic effusion.
   Differential includes PNA as most likely, malignancy or PE/heart
   failure which are less likely given exudative effusion.   Pt. w/
   effusion on CXR yest, unable to visualize posterior cardiac parenchyma,
   consolidation may be harboured there.  No hx consistent w/ PNA.  LENIs
   negative, but this has poor predictive value.   PE remains on

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD) who is currently presenting with decompensated heart failure and likely demand ischemia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.8°C (100°F)
* Heart rate: 92 bpm (with a range of 79-111 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 99/37 mmHg (with a range of 52-116/72 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 23 inspirations per minute (with a range of 20-39 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient has a number of medical conditions, including:

* Heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15-20%
* Coronary artery disease with near-akinesis of the inferior wall
* Pulmonary embolism (PE) with a high risk of recurrence
* Diabetes mellitus
* Hypothyroidism
* Obesity

The patient is currently receiving treatment for his conditions, including:

* Heparin infusion for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis
* Furosemide (Lasix) infusion for diuresis
* Metoprolol for tachycardia and suspected demand ischemia
* Aspirin and clopidogrel for antiplatelet therapy
* Warfarin for anticoagulation therapy
* Statin for lipid-lowering therapy
* Insulin and Lantus for diabetes management

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.9 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 29.1%
* Platelet count: 337 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Glucose: 227 mg/dL
* Troponin: 0.15 ng/mL
* Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP): elevated

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: shows pulmonary edema and effusions
* Echocardiogram: shows left ventricular hypokinesis and near-akinesis of the inferior wall
* Computed tomography (CT) scan: shows a pulmonary embolism

The patient's clinical course is complicated by the following potential medical complications:

* Cardiac arrest
* Pulmonary embolism
* Deep vein thrombosis
* Heart failure
* Diabetic ketoacidosis
* Hypothyroidism

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continued diuresis with furosemide and metolazone
* Beta-blocker therapy to improve filling
* Holding Lisinopril due to hypotension
* Starting levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia
* Repeat chest X-ray and laboratory studies to monitor for signs of improvement or deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with decompensated heart failure and possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) versus pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient's 24-hour events include:

* Delayed catheterization due to significant heart failure, with a plan to diuresis the patient before proceeding with the procedure
* Continued heparin infusion for concern of PE
* Thoracentesis showing an exudative effusion with elevated LDH, total protein, and white blood cell count
* Echocardiogram revealing 15-20% ejection fraction with nearly global hypokinesis, infarct akinesis, and significant aortic stenosis
* Patient's condition has improved slightly, with decreased dyspnea at rest, but remains doxy with movement

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.8°C
* Heart rate: 92 bpm
* Blood pressure: 99/37 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* SpO2: 94%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Morbidly obese male with tachypnea and diaphoresis
* Oriented x3 with appropriate mood and affect
* Decreased breath sounds on the left side, with rales up to the apex
* Marked stasis dermatitis on both legs
* Muffled heart sounds with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.1 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 13.6 K/uL
* Platelet count: 345 K/uL
* Troponin-T: 0.17 ng/mL
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 26 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium 141 mEq/L, potassium 4.2 mEq/L, chloride 105 mEq/L

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Worsening heart failure with increased pulmonary edema and effusion
* Pulmonary embolism with potential for respiratory failure
* Acute coronary syndrome with potential for myocardial infarction
* Hypothyroidism with potential for decreased metabolic rate
* Diabetic ketoacidosis with potential for severe metabolic decompensation
* Hypoglycemia with potential for altered mental status and seizures

Based on the patient's condition and laboratory results, it is recommended to continue diuresis, heparin infusion, and monitoring for potential complications. Further evaluation with a CT angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolism and a cardiac catheterization to assess coronary artery disease should be considered."

   Patient is a 69 year old morbidly obese male with a hx of DM, HTN,
   dyslipidemia, CAD presenting with decompensated heart failure and
   likely demand ischemia.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  ECGs consistent with demand ischemia and enzymes flat.
   Cath deferred at this time.  Patient has been chest pain free.
   -- will defer cath given flat enzymes.
   -- d/c Plavix as not currently ACS
   -- continue heparin and transition to Coumadin given high risk for PE;
   will likely need life-long coumadin due to body habitus
   -- cont ASA, plavix, and heparin and will transition to warfarin given
   high risk for PE (per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2830**]
   -- cont high dose statin
   -- continue metoprolol given tachycardia and suspected demand;
   currently tolerating 12.5mg PO BID
   -- avoid nitrates with concern of past IMI
   -- change aspirin to 81mg due to anticoagulation and high bleeding risk
   .
   # Pulmonary Effusion: Consistent w/ peri-pneumonic effusion.
   Differential includes PNA as most likely, malignancy or PE/heart
   failure which are less likely given exudative effusion.  No hx
   consistent w/ PNA.  LENIs negative, but this has poor predictive
   value.   PE remains on differential.
   - f/u updated lab studies from OSH today
   - follow-up PPD for ?TB

   malignancy
   - Levofloxacin for 5 day course (day #1 = [**2164-11-24**]); today is day 2 of
   5.
   - diureisis as below
   - treat for PE with heparin and Coumadin
   # PUMP:  HF likely related to ischemic cardiomyopathy of unclear
   precipitating factors.  Possibly he had recent ischemic event.  Patient
   with elevated JVP, marked pulmonary edema/effusions, elevated BNP.
   Urine output improved on Lasix gtt and Metolazone.   Hypoxia is
   improving.
   - continue Lasix gtt and Metolazone for diuresis with goal -2 to 3
   liters today
   - f/u PM lytes
   - continue w/ beta-blocker to improve filling
   - holding Lisinopril due to hypotension

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: 69 year old morbidly obese male with a hx of DM, HTN,
   dyslipidemia, CAD presenting with decombensated heart failure and
   likely demand ischemia.
   24 Hour Events:
   PPD placed yesterday.  BCx, UCx, and UA were sent given low grade
   fever.  Levofloxacin 750 mg x5 days was started for PNA yesterday.  His
   lantus was increased to 14 units for better blood sugar control.  The
   lasix gtt was continued for diuresis and metolazone 5 mg daily was
   added.  Blood cultures came back positive for GPRs (originally reported
   as GPCs).  Since this is likely a contaminate, antibiotics were not
   started.

* Pulmonary effusion: consistent with peri-pneumonic effusion, differential includes PNA, malignancy, or PE/heart failure
* Demand ischemia: ECGs consistent with demand ischemia and enzymes flat
* Hypoxia: improving, but may require further treatment
* Pulmonary embolism (PE): high risk, being treated with heparin and Coumadin
* Infection: possible PNA, being treated with Levofloxacin, but GPRs in blood likely a contaminant
* Diabetes: on Lantus and insulin sliding scale, goal blood glucose < 150 mg/dL
* Hypothyroidism: on home synthroid

Potential Medical Complications:

* Respiratory failure: due to pulmonary edema and effusion
* Cardiac arrhythmias: due to decompensated heart failure and demand ischemia
* Infection: PNA or other infections, such as urinary tract infection (UTI) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)
* Thromboembolic events: PE or deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
* Hypoglycemia: due to diabetes treatment
* Hyperthyroidism: due to hypothyroidism treatment

Plan:

* Continue Lasix gtt and Metolazone for diuresis
* Follow-up blood cultures and speciation
* Continue heparin and Coumadin for PE prophylaxis
* Continue beta-blocker to improve filling
* Hold Lisinopril due to hypotension
* F/u blood sugars and adjust Lantus as needed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was started continued on a heparin gtt and started on
   coumadin given his high risk for PE (per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2830**].  The pleural
   effusion is thought to be peri-pneumonic, however a PPD was placed as
   TB is a possibility.  BCx, UCx, and UA were sent given low grade
   fever.  Levofloxacin 750 mg x5 days was started for PNA.  His lantus
   was increased to 14 units for better blood sugar control.  The lasix
   gtt was continued for diuresis and metolazone 5 mg daily was added.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health status and potential medical complications:

Patient's Health Status:

* The patient is a 69-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD).
* He presented with decompensated heart failure and likely demand ischemia.
* He has a pleural effusion, which is thought to be peri-pneumonic, and is at high risk for pulmonary embolism (PE).
* He has a fever and is being treated for possible pneumonia.
* He has decreased breath sounds on the left side and crackles on the left side, indicating pulmonary edema.
* He has a history of recent chest pain and has been treated for possible recent myocardial infarction (MI).
* He has elevated JVP, marked pulmonary edema/effusions, and elevated BNP, indicating heart failure.
* He is on lasix gtt for diuresis and has a decreasing urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient is at high risk for PE due to his morbid obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and relative immobility. He is currently being treated with heparin and warfarin, but will need to be closely monitored for signs of PE.
* Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure is likely related to possible recent MI, and he will need to be closely monitored for signs of worsening heart failure.
* Pneumonia: The patient has a fever and is being treated for possible pneumonia. He will need to be closely monitored for signs of worsening pneumonia.
* Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has a history of diabetes and is at risk for DKA due to his high blood sugar levels and decreased urine output.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and will need to continue taking his home synthroid medication.
* Malnutrition: The patient's morbid obesity and decreased appetite due to heart failure may put him at risk for malnutrition. He will need to be closely monitored for signs of malnutrition and receive nutrition support as needed.
* Pressure Ulcers: The patient's morbid obesity and decreased mobility may put him at risk for pressure ulcers. He will need to be closely monitored for signs of pressure ulcers and receive pressure ulcer prevention measures as needed.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications and will need to be closely monitored and managed in the ICU to prevent or treat these complications."

   24 Hour Events:
   Continued diuresis with Lasix gtt and Metolazone.  Got Chest CT
   (with mucomyst) to assess for malignancy and further characterize
   parapneumonic effusion.  CT showed 3 loculated effusions in left lobe.
   Aspirin changed to 81mg.  Pt had blood culture from [**11-24**] PIV which
   grew Bacillus species, not anthrax.  This was originally mis-reported
   as GPC in chains and pt was started on Vanco, then stopped after
   results changed to GPRs.  ID curbside --> likely contaminate.  No abxs
   started.  Per PICC line team, will not place bedside PICC.  Pt is NPO
   for possible IR PICC placement.  Lasix gtt increased from 2 to 5 for
   diuresis.  Pt had large bowel movement.  Pt. w/ nonproductive cough
   o/n.  Denies CP, SOB at rest, DOE w/ transfers from bed to chair has

   3. Cardiomegaly with atherosclerosis involving the coronary arteries.
   4. Cholelithiasis
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 69 year old morbidly obese male with a hx of DM, HTN,
   dyslipidemia, CAD presenting with decompensated heart failure and
   likely demand ischemia.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  ECGs consistent with demand ischemia and enzymes flat.
   Cath deferred at this time.  Patient has been chest pain free.
   -- d/c Plavix as not currently ACS
   -- Continue ASA 81
   -- continue heparin and transition to Coumadin given high risk for PE;
   will likely need life-long coumadin due to body habitus
   -- cont high dose statin
   -- continue metoprolol given tachycardia and suspected demand;
   currently tolerating 12.5mg PO BID
   .
   # Pulmonary Effusion.  Multiloculated, consistent w/ peri-pneumonic
   effusion.  CT consistent w/ multifocal opacities, but source is still
   unclear as no aspiration, possibly atypical infection, being covered w/
   Levofloxacin.  Mediastinal [**Doctor First Name **] reactive vs. malignant.   Differential
   includes PNA as most likely or malignancy, vs PE/heart failure which
   are less likely given exudative effusion.  No hx consistent w/ PNA.
   LENIs negative, but this has poor predictive value.   PE remains on
   differential.  PPD negative at 48hrs.
   - f/u updated lab studies from OSH daily
   - follow-up PPD @ 72hrs for ?TB
   - Levofloxacin for 5 day course (day #1 = [**2164-11-24**]); today is day 3 of
   5.
   - diureisis as below
   - treat for PE with heparin and Coumadin
   - pt may require bronch once HF improves and Tx of PNA complete.
   - F/U Cx data
   # PUMP:  HF likely related to ischemic cardiomyopathy of unclear
   precipitating factors.  Possibly he had recent ischemic event.  Patient
   with elevated JVP, marked pulmonary effusions.  Urine output improved
   on Lasix gtt and Metolazone.   Hypoxia continues to improve.
   - continue Lasix gtt and Metolazone for diuresis with goal -1 to 2
   liters today
   - f/u PM lytes
   - continue w/ beta-blocker to improve filling
   - holding Lisinopril due to hypotension
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Sinus tachycardia.  Likely secondary to decompensated heart
   failure, hypoxia.  Cannot rule out pulmonary embolis.
 Metoprolol
   12.5 [**Hospital1 **], continue to tx as above w/ heparin/coumadin
   .
   # GPRs in blood: from peripheral IV; likely contaminate
   - will hold off on antibiotics until further speciation; surveillance
   cultures drawn today
   - f/u blood culture speciation
   # Anemia.  Normocytic.  TSH wnl.  HCT not improving w/ diuresis.
   Baseline unknown.  Will complete w/up.
   -          Fe studies,
   -          Guiac all stools
   -          B12, Folate.
   -          Will consider SPEP/UPEP if above not revealing give RF, but
   low suspicion for MM.
   # Diabetes:  On Lantus 14 units qday and insulin sliding scale, holding
   glyburide, Goal BG < 150, FS < 140 mostly, but increased at AM.
   - f/u blood sugars today and will increase Lantus
   # Hypothyroidism:  cont home synthroid.
   .
   FEN:  cardiac diet since no cath this morning
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with tylenol
   -Bowel regimen with colace; will give Senna and Bisacodyl (last BM

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   69 year old morbidly obese male with a hx of DM, HTN, dyslipidemia, CAD
   presenting with decombensated heart failure and likely demand
   ischemia.
   24 Hour Events:
   Continued diuresis with Lasix gtt and Metolazone.  Got Chest CT
   (with mucomyst) to assess for malignancy and further characterize
   parapneumonic effusion.  CT showed 3 loculated effusions in left lobe.
   Aspirin changed to 81mg.  Pt had blood culture from [**11-24**] PIV which
   grew Bacillus species, not anthrax.  This was originally mis-reported
   as GPC in chains and pt was started on Vanco, then stopped after
   results changed to GPRs.  ID curbside --> likely contaminate.  No abxs
   started.  Per PICC line team, will not place bedside PICC.  Pt is NPO
   for possible IR PICC placement.  Lasix gtt increased from 2 to 5 for
   diuresis.  Pt had large bowel movement.  Pt. w/ nonproductive cough
   o/n.  Denies CP, SOB at rest, DOE w/ transfers from bed to chair has
   improved.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with decompensated heart failure and likely demand ischemia.

The patient's condition has been managed with diuresis using Lasix and Metolazone, as well as heparin and Coumadin to prevent pulmonary embolism. He has also been started on antibiotics for a suspected pulmonary embolism, but the culture results have been negative.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, which may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process. His blood glucose levels have been elevated, and he has been treated with insulin and metformin.

The patient's physical examination shows signs of heart failure, including increased jugular venous pressure, rales in the lungs, and decreased breath sounds. He also has marked stasis dermatitis and lymphedema in both legs.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's elevated D-dimer levels and symptoms of dyspnea and chest pain suggest the possibility of a pulmonary embolism.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and LDH levels may indicate an underlying infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
3. Heart failure: The patient's signs of heart failure, including increased jugular venous pressure and rales in the lungs, suggest that he may be at risk for further deterioration.
4. Ischemia: The patient's symptoms of chest pain and elevated troponin levels suggest that he may be at risk for further ischemic episodes.
5. Diabetes: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels and symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia suggest that he may be at risk for further complications related to his diabetes.

Based on the patient's condition, the following potential medical complications should be considered:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient should be closely monitored for signs of a pulmonary embolism, such as dyspnea, chest pain, and tachycardia.
2. Infection: The patient should be treated with antibiotics if an infection is suspected, and his laboratory results should be closely monitored for signs of infection.
3. Heart failure: The patient should be closely monitored for signs of heart failure, such as increased jugular venous pressure and rales in the lungs, and his diuretic regimen should be adjusted as necessary.
4. Ischemia: The patient should be closely monitored for signs of ischemia, such as chest pain and elevated troponin levels, and his medication regimen should be adjusted as necessary.
5. Diabetes: The patient should be closely monitored for signs of complications related to his diabetes, such as hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis, and his medication regimen should be adjusted as necessary."

   presenting with decombensated heart failure and likely demand
   ischemia.
   24 Hour Events:
   Continued diuresis with Lasix gtt and Metolazone.  Got Chest CT
   (with mucomyst) to assess for malignancy and further characterize
   parapneumonic effusion.  CT showed 3 loculated effusions in left lobe.
   Aspirin changed to 81mg.  Pt had blood culture from [**11-24**] PIV which
   grew Bacillus species, not anthrax.  This was originally mis-reported
   as GPC in chains and pt was started on Vanco, then stopped after
   results changed to GPRs.  ID curbside --> likely contaminate.  No abxs
   started.  Per PICC line team, will not place bedside PICC.  Pt is NPO
   for possible IR PICC placement.  Lasix gtt increased from 2 to 5 for
   diuresis.  Pt had large bowel movement.  Pt. w/ nonproductive cough

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis and is at high risk for developing PE, which is a possible differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms.
2. Infection: The patient has a pleural effusion and is receiving antibiotics for a suspected infection. However, the culture results are pending, and the patient may still be at risk for developing a secondary infection.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has decompensated heart failure, which can lead to further complications such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and decreased cardiac output.
4. Ischemia: The patient has demand ischemia, which can lead to further complications such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and decreased cardiac output.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is taking medication to manage the condition. However, the patient's thyroid function tests are not up to date, and the patient may still be at risk for developing hypothyroidism-related complications.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can lead to further complications such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cardiac output.
7. Diabetic Complications: The patient has diabetes and is at risk for developing complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy.
8. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a pleural effusion and is at risk for developing respiratory failure, which can lead to further complications such as pneumonia, sepsis, and death.
9. Sepsis: The patient has a suspected infection and is at risk for developing sepsis, which can lead to further complications such as organ failure, shock, and death.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, the following interventions are recommended:

1. Continue antibiotics for the suspected infection and monitor the patient's response to treatment.
2. Continue diuretic therapy to manage the patient's heart failure and pleural effusion.
3. Monitor the patient's blood sugar levels and adjust insulin therapy as needed to manage the patient's diabetes.
4. Monitor the patient's thyroid function tests and adjust medication as needed to manage the patient's hypothyroidism.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusions if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust therapy as needed to manage the patient's demand ischemia and heart failure.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as needed to manage the patient's pleural effusion and respiratory failure.
8. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust therapy as needed to manage the patient's hypertension.
9. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust therapy as needed to manage the patient's electrolyte imbalances."

   Chief Complaint:
   69 year old morbidly obese male with a hx of DM, HTN, dyslipidemia, CAD
   presenting with decombensated heart failure and likely demand
   ischemia.
   24 Hour Events:
   Continued diuresis with Lasix gtt and Metolazone.  Got Chest CT
   (with mucomyst) to assess for malignancy and further characterize
   parapneumonic effusion.  CT showed 3 loculated effusions in left lobe.
   Aspirin changed to 81mg.  Pt had blood culture from [**11-24**] PIV which
   grew Bacillus species, not anthrax.  This was originally mis-reported
   as GPC in chains and pt was started on Vanco, then stopped after
   results changed to GPRs.  ID curbside --> likely contaminate.  No abxs
   started.  Per PICC line team, will not place bedside PICC.  Pt is NPO
   for possible IR PICC placement.  Lasix gtt increased from 2 to 5 for
   diuresis.  Pt had large bowel movement.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   69 year old morbidly obese male with a hx of DM, HTN, dyslipidemia, CAD
   presenting with decombensated heart failure and likely demand
   ischemia.
   24 Hour Events:
   Continued diuresis with Lasix gtt and Metolazone.  Got Chest CT
   (with mucomyst) to assess for malignancy and further characterize
   parapneumonic effusion.  CT showed 3 loculated effusions in left lobe.
   Aspirin changed to 81mg.  Pt had blood culture from [**11-24**] PIV which
   grew Bacillus species, not anthrax.  This was originally mis-reported
   as GPC in chains and pt was started on Vanco, then stopped after
   results changed to GPRs.  ID curbside --> likely contaminate.  No abxs
   started.  Per PICC line team, will not place bedside PICC.  Pt is NPO
   for possible IR PICC placement.  Lasix gtt increased from 2 to 5 for
   diuresis.  Pt had large bowel movement.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 69 year old morbidly obese male with a hx of DM, HTN,
   dyslipidemia, CAD presenting with decompensated heart failure and
   likely demand ischemia.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  ECGs consistent with demand ischemia and enzymes flat.
   Cath deferred at this time.  Patient has been chest pain free.
   -- will defer cath given flat enzymes.
   -- d/c Plavix as not currently ACS
   -- continue heparin and transition to Coumadin given high risk for PE;
   will likely need life-long coumadin due to body habitus
   -- cont ASA, plavix, and heparin and will transition to warfarin given
   high risk for PE (per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2830**]
   -- cont high dose statin
   -- continue metoprolol given tachycardia and suspected demand;
   currently tolerating 12.5mg PO BID
   -- avoid nitrates with concern of past IMI
   -- change aspirin to 81mg due to anticoagulation and high bleeding risk
   .
   # Pulmonary Effusion: Consistent w/ peri-pneumonic effusion.
   Differential includes PNA as most likely, malignancy or PE/heart
   failure which are less likely given exudative effusion.  No hx
   consistent w/ PNA.  LENIs negative, but this has poor predictive
   value.   PE remains on differential.
   - f/u updated lab studies from OSH today
   - follow-up PPD for ?TB
   - obtain Chest CT today to evaluate effusion further and potential for
   malignancy
   - Levofloxacin for 5 day course (day #1 = [**2164-11-24**]); today is day 2 of
   5.
   - diureisis as below
   - treat for PE with heparin and Coumadin
   # PUMP:  HF likely related to ischemic cardiomyopathy of unclear
   precipitating factors.  Possibly he had recent ischemic event.  Patient
   with elevated JVP, marked pulmonary edema/effusions, elevated BNP.
   Urine output improved on Lasix gtt and Metolazone.   Hypoxia is
   improving.
   - continue Lasix gtt and Metolazone for diuresis with goal -2 to 3
   liters today
   - f/u PM lytes
   - continue w/ beta-blocker to improve filling
   - holding Lisinopril due to hypotension
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Sinus tachycardia.  Likely secondary to decompensated heart
   failure, hypoxia.  Cannot rule out pulmonary embolis.
 Metoprolol
   12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # GPRs in blood: from peripheral IV; likely contaminate
   - will hold off on antibiotics until further speciation; surveillance
   cultures drawn today
   - f/u blood culture speciation
   # Diabetes:  On Lantus 14 units qday and insulin sliding scale, holding
   glyburide, Goal BG < 150.
   - f/u blood sugars today and adjust Lantus as needed
   # Hypothyroidism:  cont home synthroid.
   .
   FEN:  cardiac diet since no cath this morning
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with tylenol
   -Bowel regimen with colace; will give Senna and Bisacodyl (last BM

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current health status as follows:

The patient is a 69-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease, presenting with decompensated heart failure and likely demand ischemia. He is currently in the ICU, receiving treatment for his conditions.

Physiological parameters:

* Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate is 74 beats per minute, blood pressure is 95/62 mmHg, respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 9 cm, and his cardiac output is decreased.
* Fluid balance: The patient has a total fluid input of 1,482 mL and a total fluid output of 3,185 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -1,703 mL.

Medical conditions:

* Heart failure: The patient has decompensated heart failure, likely related to ischemic cardiomyopathy of unclear precipitating factors.
* Pulmonary effusion: The patient has a loculated left pleural effusion with three components, which may be related to pneumonia, malignancy, or pulmonary embolism.
* Demand ischemia: The patient has ECG changes consistent with demand ischemia, and his enzymes are flat.
* Hypoxia: The patient has hypoxia, which is improving with oxygen therapy.
* Morbid obesity: The patient is morbidly obese, which may contribute to his respiratory and cardiovascular problems.

Treatment plan:

* Diuresis: The patient is receiving diuretic therapy with Lasix and Metolazone to manage his fluid overload.
* Antibiotics: The patient was previously started on Vancomycin, but this was stopped after blood culture results showed growth of Bacillus species, which is likely a contaminant.
* Anticoagulation: The patient is receiving heparin and Coumadin to prevent pulmonary embolism.
* Pain management: The patient is receiving pain management with Tylenol.
* Bowel regimen: The patient is receiving bowel regimen with Colace, Senna, and Bisacodyl to manage his constipation.

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and pulmonary effusion may increase his risk of respiratory failure.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia and demand ischemia may increase his risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may not be sufficient to prevent pulmonary embolism, especially given his high risk factors.
* Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of a pulmonary effusion may increase his risk of infection.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and history of gastrointestinal bleeding may increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for several medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."
