You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, who was admitted with acute respiratory distress and found to have left lung collapse. The patient has undergone several interventions, including invasive ventilation, rigid bronchoscopy, and placement of an arterial line.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is receiving invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, rate of 10, and FiO2 of 100%. She has a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and a SpO2 of 100%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is likely worsening due to hypoxia and levophed use. She is receiving phenylephrine as a pressor, and her blood pressure is 86/60 mmHg.
* Hematological: The patient has anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 11.8 g/dL. She has received two units of packed red blood cells and is being transfused for a goal hemoglobin level of 25.
* Neurological: The patient is currently not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, or musculoskeletal status.
* Laboratory results: The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 21.6, platelet count of 644, and creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may require further interventions to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypotension may require further management to maintain adequate cardiac output.
* Bleeding: The patient's anemia and recent cardiac arrest may increase her risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of invasive procedures.
* Infection: The patient's respiratory status and recent procedures may increase her risk of infection.
* Metastatic disease progression: The patient's metastatic non-small cell lung cancer may continue to progress, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

* Continue invasive ventilation with close monitoring of respiratory status.
* Manage atrial fibrillation with anticoagulation and rate control measures.
* Transfuse blood products as necessary to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels.
* Monitor for signs of bleeding and take appropriate measures to prevent and treat bleeding.
* Consider further diagnostic tests, such as bronchoscopy, to evaluate for bleeding related to lung mass.
* Continue to manage the patient's underlying cancer with chemotherapy and other treatments as necessary.
* Monitor for signs of infection and take appropriate measures to prevent and treat infection.
* Consider further interventions, such as radiation therapy, to manage the patient's metastatic disease."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 63y.o. F with a PMH of metastatic non small cell Lung CA admitted
   with acute respiratory distress now s/p PEA arrest and found to have L
   lung collapse.
   .# Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - Pt found to have L lung
   collapse. Pt with known left hilar lung mass with encasement of the
   left-sided bronchi, now with collapse. Had rigid bronch this am but
   unable to stent LMS. Has had increased aeration since bronch by CXR.
   Tidal volume decreased, RR increased overnight since essentially single
   lung ventilation given LL collapse. W
   - Repeat ABg post bronch and reassess
   - consult Rad Onc for possible further management
   -  Will cover for possible post-obstructive PNA with Vanc/Zosyn
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC, TV 350, Rate 24, FIO2 50%.
   Will alter based on repeat ABG after debridement
   - If pt has hemoptysis overnight, protect R lung with positioning
   patient L side down, consider R main stem intubation
   - Will need ENT eval post extubation given vocal cord trauma
   .
   # S/P PEA Arrest - PEA arrest in the setting of respiratory failure and
   hypovolemia. Responded to epi and atropine
   - Cycle CE
   - Replete lytes, check ionized Ca, K and Mg
   - Treat underlying cause as above
   - CT Head negative for bleed and ischemia. Consider head MRI once
   stable.
   # [**Name (NI) 1531**] - Pt requiring pressors s/p PEA arrest. Extremities clamped
   down. Likely septic vs cardiogenic [**Name (NI) **] since still requiring
   pressors. Septic [**Name (NI) **] most likely given fever, likely post obstructive
   PNA. Also consideration of cardiogenic considering PEA arrest.
   - continue neo for goal MAP>60, avoid levophed given rapid AF in ED
   - cycle CE and monitor on telemetry
   - TTE to assess WMA, thrombus
   - Transfuse for HCT>25
   - Given pt recently completed course of dexamethasone for brain met
   will give stress dose steroids with hydrocort 50 Q8
   .
   # Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Ca - metastatic to right adrenal and
   cerebellum, s/p cyber knife therapy.  Treatment of lung mass as above.
   .
   # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] - holding Lovenox overnight given low HCT, repeat TTE
   today, will restart in am
   .
   # Anemia - HCT drop to 20 from baseline (30-34) of unclear etiology. CT
   Abd and Pelvis negative for bleed. Possible hemorrhage related to lung
   CA and L lung collapse. HCT up to 35, stable.
   - keep HCT>25 given cardiac arrest
   - Guaiac stools
   # Atrial Fibrillation - likely worsening in setting of hypoxia and
   levophed use - will switch pressor to neosynephrine
   - holding metoprolol given [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
   - holding lovenox for now since recently had hemoptysis and
   bronchoscopy
   .
   # Hydronephrosis - CT A&P demonstrates poorly placed R ureteral stent -
   outpatient follow up
   .
   # COPD - continue albuterol and atrovent nebs
   - monitor vent for evidence of autopeep
   .
   # HTN - holding outpatient meds given hypotension
   .
   # FEN - NPO for now. If ABG worse, cannot tolerate PSV, will place OGT
   and start TF. If able to be extubated, will restart diet
   .
   # Access - Femoral line, R art line
   .
   # Code - Full
   .
   # Dispo - ICU

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 63y.o. F with a PMH of metastatic non small cell Lung CA admitted
   with acute respiratory distress now s/p PEA arrest and found to have L
   lung collapse.
   .# Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - Pt found to have L lung
   collapse. Pt with known left hilar lung mass with encasement of the
   left-sided bronchi, now with collapse. Had rigid bronch this am but
   unable to stent LMS. Has had increased aeration since bronch by CXR.
   Tidal volume decreased, RR increased overnight since essentially single
   lung ventilation given LL collapse. W
   - Repeat ABg post bronch and reassess
   - consult Rad Onc for possible further management
   -  Will cover for possible post-obstructive PNA with Vanc/Zosyn
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC, TV 350, Rate 24, FIO2 50%.
   Will alter based on repeat ABG after debridement
   - If pt has hemoptysis overnight, protect R lung with positioning
   patient L side down, consider R main stem intubation
   - Will need ENT eval post extubation given vocal cord trauma
   .
   # S/P PEA Arrest - PEA arrest in the setting of respiratory failure and
   hypovolemia. Responded to epi and atropine
   - Cycle CE
   - Replete lytes, check ionized Ca, K and Mg
   - Treat underlying cause as above
   - CT Head negative for bleed and ischemia. Consider head MRI once
   stable.
   # [**Name (NI) 1531**] - Pt requiring pressors s/p PEA arrest. Extremities clamped
   down. Likely septic vs cardiogenic [**Name (NI) **] since still requiring
   pressors. Septic [**Name (NI) **] most likely given fever, likely post obstructive
   PNA. Also consideration of cardiogenic considering PEA arrest.
   - continue neo for goal MAP>60, avoid levophed given rapid AF in ED
   - cycle CE and monitor on telemetry
   - TTE to assess WMA, thrombus
   - Transfuse for HCT>25
   - Given pt recently completed course of dexamethasone for brain met
   will give stress dose steroids with hydrocort 50 Q8
   .
   # Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Ca - metastatic to right adrenal and
   cerebellum, s/p cyber knife therapy.  Treatment of lung mass as above.
   .
   # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] - holding Lovenox overnight given low HCT, repeat TTE
   today, will restart in am
   .
   # Anemia - HCT drop to 20 from baseline (30-34) of unclear etiology. CT
   Abd and Pelvis negative for bleed. Possible hemorrhage related to lung
   CA and L lung collapse. HCT up to 35, stable.
   - keep HCT>25 given cardiac arrest
   - Guaiac stools
   # Atrial Fibrillation - likely worsening in setting of hypoxia and
   levophed use - will switch pressor to neosynephrine
   - holding metoprolol given [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
   - holding lovenox for now since recently had hemoptysis and
   bronchoscopy
   .
   # Hydronephrosis - CT A&P demonstrates poorly placed R ureteral stent -
   outpatient follow up
   .
   # COPD - continue albuterol and atrovent nebs
   - monitor vent for evidence of autopeep
   .
   # HTN - holding outpatient meds given hypotension
   .
   # FEN - NPO for now. If ABG worse, cannot tolerate PSV, will place OGT
   and start TF. If able to be extubated, will restart diet

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, admitted with acute respiratory distress, and found to have left lung collapse. She has a history of PEA arrest, hypovolemia, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: Invasive ventilation with AC, TV 350, Rate 24, FIO2 50%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving pressors, specifically neosynephrine, to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received 2,759 mL of fluids over the past 24 hours, with a total output of 405 mL.
* Laboratory results:
	+ WBC: 21.6
	+ Hct: 37.0
	+ Plt: 644
	+ Cr: 0.5
	+ TCO2: 29
	+ Glucose: 130
	+ Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 13.8/33.1/1.2, Differential-Neuts: 92.8%, Lymph: 4.9%, Mono: 2.2%, Eos: 0.1%, Lactic Acid: 0.9 mmol/L, Ca++: 8.4 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.9 mg/dL, PO4: 3.6 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and further deterioration could lead to respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and increased lactate levels suggest possible sepsis, which could worsen her condition.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's history of PEA arrest and ongoing hypotension make her at risk for further cardiac arrest.
4. Hemorrhage: The patient's anemia and recent hemoptysis suggest possible hemorrhage, which could worsen her condition.
5. Infection: The patient's sputum gram stain shows 3+ OP flora, which may indicate a bacterial infection.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen in the setting of hypoxia and levophed use.
7. Hydronephrosis: The patient's poorly placed R ureteral stent may cause hydronephrosis, which could worsen her condition.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's NPO status and potential for prolonged hospitalization may lead to malnutrition.
9. Stress ulcer: The patient's history of PEA arrest and ongoing hypotension make her at risk for stress ulcer.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual who was admitted to the ICU with a tumor in the trachea. They have been receiving invasive ventilation, multi-lumen catheters, and arterial lines. They have a fever of 101.2°F and are receiving antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Vancomycin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 106/53 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 92%. They are receiving midazolam, fentanyl, and amiodarone infusions for sedation and pain management.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and antibiotic use suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's invasive ventilation and presence of a multi-lumen catheter increase the risk of VAP, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
3. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient's multi-lumen catheter and arterial lines increase the risk of CLABSI, which can lead to sepsis and death.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's immobility and presence of a central line increase the risk of DVT and PE, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness and presence of a central line increase the risk of stress ulcer, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and death.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia and presence of insulin therapy increase the risk of hypoglycemia, which can lead to neurological damage and death.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's presence of multi-lumen catheters and arterial lines increases the risk of electrolyte imbalance, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and death.
8. Renal failure: The patient's presence of a central line and arterial lines increases the risk of renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalance and death.
9. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's presence of a central line and arterial lines increases the risk of cardiovascular instability, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yr old woman with Stage IV lung Ca presents with resp arrest,
   cardiac arrest, and hypotension.
   Possible evolution of events was that hemoptysis evolved, clotted off
   left mainstem leading to resp distress and ultimately arrest from
   hypoxemia.
   Problems
   [**Name (NI) 1531**]
   Respiratory Failure
   Anemia
   1.       Hypoxemic Resp Distress: due to left lung collapse with
   possible post obstructive blood and or pus. Currently on AC 400 x 10,
   PIP 24, and last gas with quite hypercarbia- since she has COPFD and is
   one lung vented ? autoPEEP and created Zone 1 lung. We will try smaller
   volume and slightly faster rate. Place A line for frequent ABGs and
   hemodynamics. If she bleeds needs left lung down, advance ETT into
   right mainstem and alert IP for urgent intervention. Could also try
   endobronchial blocker. We will cover with Vanco Zosyn for possible post
   obstructive PNA esp with plans for intervention in AM.
   2.       [**Name (NI) 1531**]: Cardiac Arrest: seems that she was hypoxemic then
   bradycardic then PEA
 resolved with brief epi/atrop/CPR
 currently on
   Neo but weaning off
 goal MAP 60-65, maintain UOP 30cc/hr. Formal Echo
   to be done. Cycle CKs.
   3.       Anemia: source of blood loss unclear, not GI source, Abd CT
   neg for RP or abd bleed, may be blood in chest as source of loss though
   not overt hemoptysis now.
   4.       [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**]- likely murantic- we have to hold anti coagulation
   acutely but will need to re evaluate once rigid bronch done and risks
   benefits can be assessed.
   5.       Neuro: post arrest- short down time by report. Will check stat
   head CT to look for blled (known mets). Serail Neuro exams throughout
   evening
   Remaining issues as per Housestaff notes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with Stage IV lung cancer who has experienced respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and hypotension. She is currently intubated and sedated, and is being managed in the ICU.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has left lung collapse with possible post-obstructive blood and/or pus, leading to hypoxemic respiratory distress. She is currently being managed with mechanical ventilation, and the plan is to try smaller volume and slightly faster rate.
2. Anemia: The source of blood loss is unclear, but it is not gastrointestinal in origin. The patient may have blood in her chest as a source of loss.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient had a cardiac arrest that was resolved with brief epi/atrop/CPR. She is currently on neostigmine and is being weaned off.
4. Possible Post-Obstructive Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has a high risk of developing PNA due to her lung cancer and the possibility of post-obstructive blood and/or pus in her left lung.
5. Neurological Issues: The patient had a short downtime after her cardiac arrest, and will require serial neurological exams throughout the evening.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Hemoglobin: 11.8 g/dL
* White Blood Cell Count: 21.6 K/uL
* Platelet Count: 644 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): 29 mg/dL
* Glucose: 130 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.6 mg/dL
* Lactic Acid: 0.9 mmol/L

The patient's medical team is considering several potential complications, including:

* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Stress ulceration
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
* Pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Cardiac arrhythmias

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Mechanical ventilation with a goal of weaning off the ventilator
* Cardiovascular support with vasopressors and inotropes
* Blood product transfusions as needed
* Antibiotic therapy for possible post-obstructive PNA
* Anticoagulation therapy to prevent DVT and PE
* Stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors
* Serial neurological exams to monitor for neurological deterioration
* Consideration of endobronchial blocker or left lung down to manage respiratory distress."

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yr old woman with Stage IV lung Ca presents with resp arrest,
   cardiac arrest, and hypotension.
   Possible evolution of events was that hemoptysis evolved, clotted off
   left mainstem leading to resp. distress and ultimately arrest from
   hypoxemia.
   Problems
   [**Name (NI) 1531**]
   Respiratory Failure
   Anemia
   1.       Hypoxemic Resp Distress: due to left lung collapse with
   possible post obstructive blood and or pus. Currently on AC 350 x 24,
   PIP 24, and acceptable ventilation and oxygenation.  If she re-bleeds
   needs left lung down, advance ETT into right mainstem and alert IP for
   urgent intervention. Could also try endobronchial blocker. We will
   cover with Vanco Zosyn for possible post obstructive PNA. Will speak
   with Rad Onc re role of salvage XRT.
   2.       [**Name (NI) 1531**]: Cardiac Arrest: seems that she was hypoxemic then
   bradycardic then PEA
 resolved with brief epi/atrop/CPR
 currently on
   Neo but weaning off
 goal MAP 60-65, maintain UOP 30cc/hr. Formal Echo
   pending.
   3.       Anemia: repeat Hct actually stable- initial may have been
   spurious. RP or abd bleed, may be blood in chest as source of loss
   though not overt hemoptysis now.
   4.       [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**]- likely murantic- we have to hold anti coagulation
   acutely but will need to re evaluate once stable from bleeding
   standpoint.
   5.       Neuro: post arrest- short down time by report. Prelim head CT

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   pending.
   3.       Anemia: repeat Hct actually stable- initial may have been
   spurious. RP or abd bleed, may be blood in chest as source of loss
   though not overt hemoptysis now.
   4.       [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**]- likely murantic- we have to hold anti coagulation
   acutely but will need to re evaluate once stable from bleeding
   standpoint.
   5.       Neuro: post arrest- short down time by report. Prelim head CT

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old woman with Stage IV lung cancer who suffered a hypoxemic PEA arrest and was intubated in the ICU. She underwent rigid bronchoscopy to clear a clot in her left mainstem bronchus and was given antibiotics for possible post-obstructive pneumonia. She is currently on invasive ventilation, multi-lumen catheters, and arterial lines. Her vital signs are stable, but she has a fever and is experiencing tachycardia. Her physical examination reveals coarse inspiratory and expiratory wheezes over the left chest, and her lab results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may require further interventions to improve oxygenation and ventilation. The possibility of re-bleeding and the need for left lung down and ETT advancement into the right mainstem bronchus are significant concerns.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest was likely caused by hypoxemia, and she may be at risk for further cardiac complications. Weaning off neostigmine and maintaining a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60-65 mmHg are important goals.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely related to bleeding, and further evaluation is needed to determine the source of blood loss. Repeat Hct is stable, but the patient may require blood transfusions.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a likely coagulopathy, and anti-coagulation therapy should be held acutely. Further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of coagulopathy and the need for further therapy.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status is unclear, and further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of any neurological damage.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly pneumonia, and further evaluation is needed to determine the presence of infection and the need for antibiotics.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding and obstruction, and further evaluation is needed to determine the presence of these complications.
8. Renal Complications: The patient's renal function is abnormal, and further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of renal damage and the need for dialysis.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and further evaluation to determine the extent of her medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 63y.o. F with a PMH of metastatic non small cell Lung CA admitted
   with acute respiratory distress now s/p PEA arrest and L lung collapse.
   # Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - Pt found to have L lung
   collapse with improved aeration s/p debridement. Pt with known left
   hilar lung mass with encasement of the left-sided bronchi, now with
   collapse. Had rigid bronch yesterday but unable to stent LMS. Has had
   increased aeration since bronch by CXR. Tidal volume increased
   overnight with improved ABGs
   - Repeat ABg post bronch and reassess, may have improved respirataory
   status after thoracentesis
   - Will cover for possible post-obstructive PNA with Vanc/Zosyn, F/U cx
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC, Pressure support trials.  Will
   alter based on repeat ABGs
   - If pt has hemoptysis overnight, protect R lung with positioning
   patient L side down, consider R main stem intubation
   - Will need ENT eval post extubation given vocal cord trauma
   - Lasix 40 IV given for possibility of fluid overload contributing to
   respiratory distress and +multiple liters over hospital course
   .
   # S/P PEA Arrest - PEA arrest in the setting of respiratory failure and
   hypovolemia. Responded to epi and atropine
   - CE neg x 2
   - Replete lytes prn
   - Treat underlying cause as above
   - CT Head negative for bleed and ischemia. Consider head MRI once
   stable.
   # [**Name (NI) 1531**] - Pt still requiring pressors s/p PEA arrest. Likely
   cardiogenic [**Name (NI) **] with component of sepsis given hypokinetic dilated RV
   on Echo. Extremities clamped down. PE also possible given
   hypercoagulable state with malignancy, h/o [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**]. Diagnosing PE,
   however, would not change management since needs anticoagulation anyway
   - continue neo for goal MAP>60, avoid levophed given rapid AF in ED
   - monitor on telemetry
   - will attempt to diurese to optimize fluid status by starting lasix
   drip, following Is and Os
   - Transfuse for HCT>25
   - Given pt recently completed course of dexamethasone for brain met
   will give stress dose steroids with hydrocort 50 Q8
   .
   # Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Ca - metastatic to right adrenal and
   cerebellum, s/p cyber knife therapy.  Treatment of lung mass as above.
   Rad Onc consulted and will follow. No treatment recommended at this
   time
   .
   # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
 Will restart Lovenox tonight  given risk of having [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
   [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**] +/- PE and need to anticoagulate. We will resite line today
   and she had bronch and thoracentesis so ok to restart this evening
   - restart lovenox tonight
   # Anemia - HCT drop to 20 from baseline (30-34) of unclear etiology. CT
   Abd and Pelvis negative for bleed. Possible hemorrhage related to lung
   CA and L lung collapse. HCT up to 35, stable.
   - keep HCT>25 given cardiac arrest
   - Guaiac stools
   # Atrial Fibrillation - likely worsening in setting of hypoxia and
   levophed use
 now on neosynephrine. Off amio drip and will change to
   amio 400 mg PO BID (equivalent dose to what she received IV)
   - holding metoprolol given [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
   - will restart anticoag
   - AMio 400 PO BID
   # Hydronephrosis - CT A&P demonstrates poorly placed R ureteral stent -
   outpatient follow up
   # COPD - continue albuterol and atrovent nebs
   - monitor vent for evidence of autopeep
   # HTN - holding outpatient meds given hypotension
   # FEN
 Started TF
   # Access - Femoral line, will resite
   # Code
 Full, will have family meeting
   .
   # Dispo - ICU

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 63y.o. F with a PMH of metastatic non small cell Lung CA admitted
   with acute respiratory distress now s/p PEA arrest and L lung collapse.
   # Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - Pt found to have L lung
   collapse with improved aeration s/p debridement. Pt with known left
   hilar lung mass with encasement of the left-sided bronchi, now with
   collapse. Had rigid bronch yesterday but unable to stent LMS. Has had
   increased aeration since bronch by CXR. Tidal volume increased
   overnight with improved ABGs
   - Repeat ABg post bronch and reassess, may have improved respirataory
   status after thoracentesis
   - Will cover for possible post-obstructive PNA with Vanc/Zosyn, F/U cx
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC, Pressure support trials.  Will
   alter based on repeat ABGs
   - If pt has hemoptysis overnight, protect R lung with positioning
   patient L side down, consider R main stem intubation
   - Will need ENT eval post extubation given vocal cord trauma
   - Lasix 40 IV given for possibility of fluid overload contributing to
   respiratory distress and +multiple liters over hospital course
   .
   # S/P PEA Arrest - PEA arrest in the setting of respiratory failure and
   hypovolemia. Responded to epi and atropine
   - CE neg x 2
   - Replete lytes prn
   - Treat underlying cause as above
   - CT Head negative for bleed and ischemia. Consider head MRI once
   stable.
   # [**Name (NI) 1531**] - Pt still requiring pressors s/p PEA arrest. Likely
   cardiogenic [**Name (NI) **] with component of sepsis given hypokinetic dilated RV
   on Echo. Extremities clamped down. PE also possible given
   hypercoagulable state with malignancy, h/o [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**]. Diagnosing PE,
   however, would not change management since needs anticoagulation anyway
   - continue neo for goal MAP>60, avoid levophed given rapid AF in ED
   - monitor on telemetry
   - will attempt to diurese to optimize fluid status by starting lasix
   drip, following Is and Os
   - Transfuse for HCT>25
   - Given pt recently completed course of dexamethasone for brain met
   will give stress dose steroids with hydrocort 50 Q8
   .
   # Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Ca - metastatic to right adrenal and
   cerebellum, s/p cyber knife therapy.  Treatment of lung mass as above.
   Rad Onc consulted and will follow. No treatment recommended at this
   time
   .
   # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
 Will restart Lovenox tonight  given risk of having [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
   [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**] +/- PE and need to anticoagulate. We will resite line today
   and she had bronch and thoracentesis so ok to restart this evening
   - restart lovenox tonight
   # Anemia - HCT drop to 20 from baseline (30-34) of unclear etiology. CT
   Abd and Pelvis negative for bleed. Possible hemorrhage related to lung
   CA and L lung collapse. HCT up to 35, stable.
   - keep HCT>25 given cardiac arrest
   - Guaiac stools
   # Atrial Fibrillation - likely worsening in setting of hypoxia and
   levophed use
 now on neosynephrine. Off amio drip and will change to
   amio 400 mg PO BID (equivalent dose to what she received IV)
   - holding metoprolol given [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
   - will restart anticoag
   - AMio 400 PO BID
   # Hydronephrosis - CT A&P demonstrates poorly placed R ureteral stent -
   outpatient follow up
   # COPD - continue albuterol and atrovent nebs
   - monitor vent for evidence of autopeep
   # HTN - holding outpatient meds given hypotension

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, who was admitted with acute respiratory distress and later developed a PEA arrest. She underwent a bronchoscopy with LMS debridement and had a thoracentesis procedure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation, with a tidal volume increased overnight. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and is receiving anticoagulation therapy. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 11.5 g/dL, and her cardiac enzymes are elevated, indicating possible cardiac damage.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, with ongoing respiratory failure and hypoxia. The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 180, indicating moderate hypoxemia. The patient's tidal volume has been increased overnight, but further adjustments may be necessary to optimize her respiratory status.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, indicating possible cardiac damage. The patient's atrial fibrillation is likely worsening, and she is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
3. Hemorrhagic Complications: The patient's anemia is of unclear etiology, and she has a history of lung cancer and lung collapse. The patient is at risk for further bleeding complications, particularly in the setting of anticoagulation therapy.
4. Sepsis: The patient's BAL results show moderate growth of OP flora, indicating possible sepsis. The patient's temperature is 37.5°C, and her white blood cell count is 21.6 x 10^9/L, which may indicate an inflammatory response.
5. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a history of hypercoagulable state and malignancy, and she is at risk for developing a pulmonary embolism. The patient's CT head results are negative for bleed and ischemia, but a head MRI may be necessary to rule out any cerebral ischemia.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient has received multiple liters of fluid over her hospital course, and she is at risk for developing fluid overload. The patient's urine output is 620 mL, and her blood pressure is 108/103 mmHg, indicating possible fluid overload.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's head MRI may be necessary to rule out any cerebral ischemia or hemorrhage. The patient's neurological status is stable, but she is at risk for further neurological complications, particularly in the setting of cardiac arrest and hypoxia.

Overall, the patient's medical condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. The patient's respiratory, cardiac, and hematological status require ongoing assessment and management, and the patient is at risk for further complications, particularly in the setting of sepsis, hemorrhage, and fluid overload."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition remains critical. The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which revealed a dilated right ventricle with borderline normal function, compared to the prior study. The patient was weaned off pressors, but still requires significant respiratory support.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 37.5°C, Tcurrent of 36.8°C, HR of 79 bpm, BP of 108/103 mmHg, RR of 24 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm remains in sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results show elevated WBC count (21.6) and platelet count (644), with a slightly elevated CRP (0.6 mg/dL). The patient's kidney function is within normal limits, with a creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL. The patient's glucose level is slightly elevated at 103 mg/dL.

The patient's respiratory support remains complex, with a ventilator mode of CPAP/PSV, set Vt of 450 mL, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The patient's oxygen delivery device is an endotracheal tube, and FiO2 is set at 50%.

The patient's fluid balance is being closely monitored, with a total fluid input of 5,081 mL and a total fluid output of 620 mL. The patient's urine output is 620 mL, and their NG output is 44 mL.

The patient's medication list includes antibiotics, anticoagulants, and analgesics. The patient's allergies include sulfa and codeine.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is complex, and further deterioration of lung function may lead to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's dilated right ventricle and borderline normal left ventricular function may increase the risk of cardiac failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count and CRP level may indicate the presence of an infection, which could lead to sepsis.
4. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is elevated, but their coagulation profile is not provided. This may increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Renal failure: The patient's kidney function is within normal limits, but the patient's fluid balance is being closely monitored, and further fluid overload may lead to renal failure.
6. GI bleeding: The patient's NG output is 44 mL, which may indicate the presence of GI bleeding.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of VAP.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's anticoagulation therapy may not be adequate to prevent the development of DVT.

Based on this information, it is essential to continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, lab results, and fluid balance. The patient's respiratory support should be adjusted as necessary to maintain optimal oxygenation and ventilation. The patient's antibiotic therapy should be continued and adjusted as necessary based on the results of cultures and sensitivity tests. The patient's anticoagulation therapy should be continued and adjusted as necessary based on the results of coagulation studies."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 63y.o. F with a PMH of metastatic non small cell Lung CA admitted
   with acute respiratory distress now s/p PEA arrest and found to have L
   lung collapse.
   .# Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - Pt found to have L lung
   collapse. Pt with known left hilar lung mass with encasement of the
   left-sided bronchi, now with collapse. Had rigid bronch this am but
   unable to stent LMS. Has had increased aeration since bronch by CXR.
   Tidal volume decreased, RR increased overnight since essentially single
   lung ventilation given LL collapse. W
   - Repeat ABg post bronch and reassess
   - consult Rad Onc for possible further management
   -  Will cover for possible post-obstructive PNA with Vanc/Zosyn
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC, TV 350, Rate 24, FIO2 50%.
   Will alter based on repeat ABG after debridement
   - If pt has hemoptysis overnight, protect R lung with positioning
   patient L side down, consider R main stem intubation
   - Will need ENT eval post extubation given vocal cord trauma
   .
   # S/P PEA Arrest - PEA arrest in the setting of respiratory failure and
   hypovolemia. Responded to epi and atropine
   - Cycle CE
   - Replete lytes, check ionized Ca, K and Mg
   - Treat underlying cause as above
   - CT Head negative for bleed and ischemia. Consider head MRI once
   stable.
   # [**Name (NI) 1531**] - Pt requiring pressors s/p PEA arrest. Extremities clamped
   down. Likely septic vs cardiogenic [**Name (NI) **] since still requiring
   pressors. Septic [**Name (NI) **] most likely given fever, likely post obstructive
   PNA. Also consideration of cardiogenic considering PEA arrest.
   - continue neo for goal MAP>60, avoid levophed given rapid AF in ED
   - cycle CE and monitor on telemetry
   - TTE to assess WMA, thrombus
   - Transfuse for HCT>25
   - Given pt recently completed course of dexamethasone for brain met
   will give stress dose steroids with hydrocort 50 Q8
   .
   # Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Ca - metastatic to right adrenal and
   cerebellum, s/p cyber knife therapy.  Treatment of lung mass as above.
   .
   # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] - holding Lovenox overnight given low HCT, repeat TTE
   today, will restart in am
   # Anemia - HCT drop to 20 from baseline (30-34) of unclear etiology. CT
   Abd and Pelvis negative for bleed. Possible hemorrhage related to lung
   CA and L lung collapse. HCT up to 35, stable.
   - keep HCT>25 given cardiac arrest
   - Guaiac stools
   # Atrial Fibrillation - likely worsening in setting of hypoxia and
   levophed use - will switch pressor to neosynephrine
   - holding metoprolol given [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
   - holding lovenox for now since recently had hemoptysis and
   bronchoscopy
   # Hydronephrosis - CT A&P demonstrates poorly placed R ureteral stent -
   outpatient follow up
   # COPD - continue albuterol and atrovent nebs
   - monitor vent for evidence of autopeep
   # HTN - holding outpatient meds given hypotension
   # FEN - NPO for now. If ABG worse, cannot tolerate PSV, will place OGT
   and start TF. If able to be extubated, will restart diet
   # Access - Femoral line, R art line
   # Code - Full
   .
   # Dispo - ICU

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 63y.o. F with a PMH of metastatic non small cell Lung CA admitted
   with acute respiratory distress now s/p PEA arrest and found to have L
   lung collapse.
   .# Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - Pt found to have L lung
   collapse. Pt with known left hilar lung mass with encasement of the
   left-sided bronchi, now with collapse. Had rigid bronch this am but
   unable to stent LMS. Has had increased aeration since bronch by CXR.
   Tidal volume decreased, RR increased overnight since essentially single
   lung ventilation given LL collapse. W
   - Repeat ABg post bronch and reassess
   - consult Rad Onc for possible further management
   -  Will cover for possible post-obstructive PNA with Vanc/Zosyn
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC, TV 350, Rate 24, FIO2 50%.
   Will alter based on repeat ABG after debridement
   - If pt has hemoptysis overnight, protect R lung with positioning
   patient L side down, consider R main stem intubation
   - Will need ENT eval post extubation given vocal cord trauma
   .
   # S/P PEA Arrest - PEA arrest in the setting of respiratory failure and
   hypovolemia. Responded to epi and atropine
   - Cycle CE
   - Replete lytes, check ionized Ca, K and Mg
   - Treat underlying cause as above
   - CT Head negative for bleed and ischemia. Consider head MRI once
   stable.
   # [**Name (NI) 1531**] - Pt requiring pressors s/p PEA arrest. Extremities clamped
   down. Likely septic vs cardiogenic [**Name (NI) **] since still requiring
   pressors. Septic [**Name (NI) **] most likely given fever, likely post obstructive
   PNA. Also consideration of cardiogenic considering PEA arrest.
   - continue neo for goal MAP>60, avoid levophed given rapid AF in ED
   - cycle CE and monitor on telemetry
   - TTE to assess WMA, thrombus
   - Transfuse for HCT>25
   - Given pt recently completed course of dexamethasone for brain met
   will give stress dose steroids with hydrocort 50 Q8
   .
   # Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Ca - metastatic to right adrenal and
   cerebellum, s/p cyber knife therapy.  Treatment of lung mass as above.
   .
   # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] - holding Lovenox overnight given low HCT, repeat TTE
   today, will restart in am
   # Anemia - HCT drop to 20 from baseline (30-34) of unclear etiology. CT
   Abd and Pelvis negative for bleed. Possible hemorrhage related to lung
   CA and L lung collapse. HCT up to 35, stable.
   - keep HCT>25 given cardiac arrest
   - Guaiac stools
   # Atrial Fibrillation - likely worsening in setting of hypoxia and
   levophed use - will switch pressor to neosynephrine
   - holding metoprolol given [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
   - holding lovenox for now since recently had hemoptysis and
   bronchoscopy
   # Hydronephrosis - CT A&P demonstrates poorly placed R ureteral stent -
   outpatient follow up
   # COPD - continue albuterol and atrovent nebs
   - monitor vent for evidence of autopeep
   # HTN - holding outpatient meds given hypotension
   # FEN - NPO for now. If ABG worse, cannot tolerate PSV, will place OGT
   and start TF. If able to be extubated, will restart diet

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yr old woman with Stage IV lung Ca presents with resp arrest,
   cardiac arrest, and hypotension.
   Possible evolution of events was that hemoptysis evolved, clotted off
   left mainstem leading to resp. distress and ultimately arrest from
   hypoxemia.
   Problems
   [**Name (NI) 1531**]
   Respiratory Failure
   Anemia
   1.       Hypoxemic Resp Distress: due to left lung collapse with
   possible post obstructive blood and or pus. Currently on AC 350 x 24,
   PIP 24, and acceptable ventilation and oxygenation. Repeat procedure by
   IP topday shows [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 1567**] [**Location (un) 1568**] but patent and CXR shows open. [**Female First Name (un) 1569**] by
   IP at bedside to attempt for max expansion of left lung We will cover
   with Vanco Zosyn for possible post obstructive PNA. Hold off on Rad Onc
   re role of salvage XRT.
   2.       [**Female First Name (un) 1531**]: Cardiac
 RV dysfunction- likely hypoxemic overload and
   possible PA compression with mass, PE also possibility. We are
   anticoagulating.  On we are pursuing diuresis to unload
 Place neck
   CVL for CVp and SCVo2.
   3.       Anemia: repeat Hct actually stable

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old woman with Stage IV lung cancer who presented with respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and hypotension. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 116 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 107/76 mmHg. She has atrial fibrillation and is receiving anticoagulation therapy.

The patient has a history of left lung collapse with possible post-obstructive blood and pus, which may have contributed to her respiratory distress and arrest. She is also experiencing cardiac dysfunction, likely due to hypoxemic overload and possible pulmonary embolism. Anemia is also a concern, with a hematocrit of 34.9%. The patient is receiving diuresis to unload her heart and is being monitored for signs of cardiac dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is precarious, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring of her oxygenation and ventilation is essential.
2. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring of her cardiac status is essential, and diuresis should be continued to unload her heart.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is a concern, and close monitoring of her hematocrit is essential. Transfusion may be necessary if her anemia worsens.
4. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's history of left lung collapse and possible post-obstructive blood and pus may have contributed to her respiratory distress and arrest. Close monitoring for signs of pulmonary embolism is essential.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection, particularly given her history of respiratory failure and cardiac dysfunction. Close monitoring for signs of infection is essential, and antibiotics should be administered if necessary.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's post-arrest neurological status is a concern, and close monitoring for signs of neurological deterioration is essential.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for further complications, and close monitoring and management are essential to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with respiratory failure. They have a history of 60 Gy radiation therapy and are currently receiving antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Vancomycin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 116 bpm, and blood pressure of 107/76 mmHg. They are mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.38, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 90 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 45 mmHg.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Infection: The patient is receiving antibiotics, but there is a risk of developing antibiotic-resistant infections.
3. Radiation toxicity: The patient has received 60 Gy radiation therapy, which may lead to radiation toxicity, including radiation pneumonitis or esophagitis.
4. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and there is a risk of further hemodynamic instability.
5. Neurologic compromise: The patient's neurologic status is not well-documented, and there is a risk of neurologic compromise due to respiratory failure, hypoxia, or other factors.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer prophylaxis and the use of anticoagulants.
7. Venous thromboembolism: The patient is at risk of developing venous thromboembolism due to immobility and the use of anticoagulants.
8. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to the presence of infection and the use of antibiotics.
9. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function is not well-documented, and there is a risk of acute kidney injury due to hypotension, sepsis, or other factors.
10. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation, and there is a risk of further cardiac arrhythmias."

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yr old woman with Stage IV lung Ca presents with resp arrest,
   cardiac arrest, and hypotension.
   Possible evolution of events was that hemoptysis evolved, clotted off
   left mainstem leading to resp. distress and ultimately arrest from
   hypoxemia.
   Problems
   [**Name (NI) 1531**]
   Respiratory Failure
   Anemia
   1.       Hypoxemic Resp Distress: due to left lung collapse with
   possible post obstructive blood and or pus. Currently on AC 350 x 24,
   PIP 24, and acceptable ventilation and oxygenation.  If she re-bleeds
   needs left lung down, advance ETT into right mainstem and alert IP for
   urgent intervention. Could also try endobronchial blocker. We will
   cover with Vanco Zosyn for possible post obstructive PNA. Will speak
   with Rad Onc re role of salvage XRT.
   2.       [**Name (NI) 1531**]: Cardiac Arrest: seems that she was hypoxemic then
   bradycardic then PEA
 resolved with brief epi/atrop/CPR
 currently on
   Neo but weaning off
 goal MAP 60-65, maintain UOP 30cc/hr. Formal Echo
   pending.
   3.       Anemia: repeat Hct actually stable- initial may have been
   spurious. RP or abd bleed, may be blood in chest as source of loss
   though not overt hemoptysis now.
   4.       [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**]- likely murantic- we have to hold anti coagulation
   acutely but will need to re evaluate once stable from bleeding
   standpoint.
   5.       Neuro: post arrest- short down time by report. Prelim head CT
   Remaining issues as per Housestaff notes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yr old woman with Stage IV lung Ca presents with resp arrest,
   cardiac arrest, and hypotension.
   Possible evolution of events was that hemoptysis evolved, clotted off
   left mainstem leading to resp. distress and ultimately arrest from
   hypoxemia.
   Problems
   [**Name (NI) 1531**]
   Respiratory Failure
   Anemia
   1.       Hypoxemic Resp Distress: due to left lung collapse with
   possible post obstructive blood and or pus. Currently on AC 350 x 24,
   PIP 24, and acceptable ventilation and oxygenation.  If she re-bleeds
   needs left lung down, advance ETT into right mainstem and alert IP for
   urgent intervention. Could also try endobronchial blocker. We will
   cover with Vanco Zosyn for possible post obstructive PNA. Will speak
   with Rad Onc re role of salvage XRT.
   2.       [**Name (NI) 1531**]: Cardiac Arrest: seems that she was hypoxemic then
   bradycardic then PEA
 resolved with brief epi/atrop/CPR
 currently on
   Neo but weaning off
 goal MAP 60-65, maintain UOP 30cc/hr. Formal Echo
   pending.
   3.       Anemia: repeat Hct actually stable- initial may have been
   spurious. RP or abd bleed, may be blood in chest as source of loss
   though not overt hemoptysis now.
   4.       [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**]- likely murantic- we have to hold anti coagulation
   acutely but will need to re evaluate once stable from bleeding
   standpoint.
   5.       Neuro: post arrest- short down time by report. Prelim head CT
   Remaining issues as per Housestaff notes.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with stage IV lung cancer who presented with respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and hypotension. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.5°C (99.5°F)
* Heart rate: 116 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 107/76 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 11.5 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 21.6 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count: 644 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.01 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.6 mmol/L

The patient's medical issues include:

* Respiratory failure due to left lung collapse with possible post-obstructive blood and/or pus
* Anemia, which may be due to blood loss or bleeding in the chest
* Cardiac arrest, which resolved with brief epi/atrop/CPR
* Possible pulmonary embolism, which is being monitored

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing mechanical ventilation with PEEP and FiO2 adjustments as needed
* Monitoring for bleeding and anemia
* Weaning off neo and maintaining MAP 60-65
* Formal echo pending
* Holding anti-coagulation therapy acutely and re-evaluating once stable
* Monitoring for neurologic sequelae

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further bleeding or anemia
* Pulmonary embolism or respiratory failure
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure
* Neurologic sequelae, such as seizures or stroke
* Infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to address her multiple medical issues and prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yr old woman with Stage IV lung Ca presents with resp arrest,
   cardiac arrest, and hypotension.
   Possible evolution of events was that hemoptysis evolved, clotted off
   left mainstem leading to resp. distress and ultimately arrest from
   hypoxemia.
   Problems
   [**Name (NI) 1531**]
   Respiratory Failure
   Anemia
   1.       Hypoxemic Resp Distress: due to left lung collapse with
   possible post obstructive blood and or pus. Currently on AC 350 x 24,
   PIP 24, and acceptable ventilation and oxygenation.  If she re-bleeds
   needs left lung down, advance ETT into right mainstem and alert IP for
   urgent intervention. Could also try endobronchial blocker. We will
   cover with Vanco Zosyn for possible post obstructive PNA. Will speak
   with Rad Onc re role of salvage XRT.
   2.       [**Name (NI) 1531**]: Cardiac Arrest: seems that she was hypoxemic then
   bradycardic then PEA
 resolved with brief epi/atrop/CPR
 currently on
   Neo but weaning off
 goal MAP 60-65, maintain UOP 30cc/hr. Formal Echo
   pending.
   3.       Anemia: repeat Hct actually stable- initial may have been
   spurious. RP or abd bleed, may be blood in chest as source of loss
   though not overt hemoptysis now.
   4.       [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**]- likely murantic- we have to hold anti coagulation
   acutely but will need to re evaluate once stable from bleeding
   standpoint.
   5.       Neuro: post arrest- short down time by report. Prelim head CT
   Remaining issues as per Housestaff notes.

Summary:

The patient, a 63-year-old woman with Stage IV lung cancer, has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and hypotension. She has a history of respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and hypotension. The patient's condition is complicated by left lung collapse, possible post-obstructive blood and/or pus, and anemia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy. The patient's cardiac arrest was resolved with brief epinephrine, atropine, and CPR.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is complicated by left lung collapse, possible post-obstructive blood and/or pus, and anemia. She is at risk of developing further respiratory distress and failure if her left lung collapse is not addressed.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest was resolved with brief epinephrine, atropine, and CPR. However, she is at risk of developing further cardiac instability if her underlying condition is not addressed.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is complicated by blood loss, possibly due to bleeding in the chest or abdomen. She is at risk of developing further anemia if her bleeding is not controlled.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's post-arrest short downtime by report suggests that she may be at risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.
5. Infection: The patient's history of hypotension and cardiac arrest suggests that she may be at risk of developing infection, particularly pneumonia.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's history of bleeding and cardiac arrest suggests that she may be at risk of developing coagulopathy, particularly disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of hypotension and cardiac arrest suggests that she may be at risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel ischemia or perforation.
8. Renal failure: The patient's history of hypotension and cardiac arrest suggests that she may be at risk of developing renal failure.

In summary, the patient is at risk of developing a range of medical complications, including respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, anemia, neurological complications, infection, coagulopathy, gastrointestinal complications, and renal failure."
