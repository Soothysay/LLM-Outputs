   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 1908**] [**Known lastname 9824**] is a 74 yo Russian-speaking male with h/o ESRD on
   HD, HTN, HL, and CAD who presented with asymptomatic bradycardia.
   .
   # Bradycardia / Rhythm -  Patient with bradycardia consistent with 2nd
   degree AV block as he has sinus node activity with some conduction to
   the ventricles.  He remains asymptomatic with HR's in the 30's-40's at
   this time.  He likely needs a pacemaker.  This may be secondary to
   calcifications since he is on hemodialysis, due to coronary artery
   disease, or possibly hypothyroidism.  Either way, patient would likely
   benefit from PPM.  Access may be difficult for the procedure, as he has
   significant peripheral vascular disease and renal dialysis graft
   complications in the past.
   - Possible PPM today
   - FU EP recs
   - Transcutaneous pacer at bedside
   - Remains NPO after midnight for possible procedure
   - FU TSH level
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   #. Hypertension - Patient hypertensive in the ED and upon reaching the
   CCU.  He reports that his blood pressures always run high after
   dialysis and he is on a number of medications for BP control.
   - Continue lisinopril 20mg po daily, diovan 80mg po daily, amlodipine
   7.5mg po daily, clonidine 0.2mg po daily, and HCTZ 12.5mg po daily
   - Patient due for his morning doses of his BP meds this morning, and
   will titrate up these medications as needed as patient still
   hypertensive
   .
   # CAD -  Patient with history of coronary artery disease (last cath
   [**2155**] showed 50% lesion of ramus intermedius), now presenting with new
   onset bradycardia.  Unlikely CAD as patient without history of chest
   pain.
   - Continue ASA 81mg po daily
   - Have started simvastatin 20mg po daily
   .
   #. Pump - Last echo in [**3-20**] showed mildly depressed systolic function,
   with LVEF=45 and inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis.
   - Will optimally manage pump with blood pressure control
   .
   #. Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V on HD - patient dialyzed today and
   currently electrolytes are within normal limits.  Patient with prior
   graft sites on both left and right side; current dialysis site is
   through left IJ line and vascular surgery does not recommend further
   attempts at grafts in the upper extremities.
   - Consult renal fellow in the morning to continue dialysis MWF while
   patient in house
   - Monitor electrolytes daily and replete aggressively for goal K>4.0
   and Mag>2.0
   - Continue calcium acetate and nephrocaps
   - Will continue ASA 81mg po daily
   .
   #. Peripheral Vascular Disease - patient with significant peripheral
   vascular disease and recently seen by vascular here at [**Hospital1 54**].
   - Will order venous studies as recommended by vascular service here and
   will consult them with questions
   - Continue ASA 81mg po daily
   - Encourage smoking cessation
   Asthma/COPD -  Patient with long-standing asthma and COPD with wheezing
   at baseline.
   - Continue outpatient inhalers Spiriva and Advair, as well as
   fexofenadine
   .
   #. Prostate cancer -  currently stable and status post-XRT.
   .
   #. Depression - continued citalopram, Aricept

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Kidney injury or failure due to dialysis or underlying chronic kidney disease
* Peripheral vascular disease complications, such as claudication or gangrene
* Respiratory failure due to COPD or asthma exacerbation
* Infections, such as sepsis or pneumonia, due to compromised immune system

The plan for the patient's care includes:

* Possible PPM procedure today
* FU EP recs
* Transcutaneous pacer at bedside
* Remain NPO after midnight for possible procedure
* FU TSH level
* Monitor on tele
* Continue medications as prescribed
* Consult renal fellow in the morning to continue dialysis MWF while patient in house
* Monitor electrolytes daily and replete aggressively for goal K>4.0 and Mag>2.0

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 1908**] [**Known lastname 9824**] is a 74 yo Russian-speaking male with h/o ESRD on
   HD, HTN, HL, and CAD who presented with asymptomatic bradycardia.
   .
   # Bradycardia / Rhythm -  Patient with bradycardia consistent with 2nd
   degree AV block as he has sinus node activity with some conduction to
   the ventricles.  He remains asymptomatic with HR's in the 30's-40's at
   this time.  He likely needs a pacemaker.  This may be secondary to
   calcifications since he is on hemodialysis, due to coronary artery
   disease, or possibly hypothyroidism.  Either way, patient would likely
   benefit from PPM.  Access may be difficult for the procedure, as he has
   significant peripheral vascular disease and renal dialysis graft
   complications in the past.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following conditions and potential medical complications can arise:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently in the 30s-40s, which is a sign of bradycardia. This can be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as a second-degree AV block, which may require a pacemaker.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently elevated, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, stroke, and kidney damage.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which can increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction and arrhythmias.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Stage V on Hemodialysis (HD): The patient's kidney function is severely impaired, and they require regular hemodialysis. This can increase the risk of electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and cardiovascular complications.
5. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): The patient has significant PVD, which can increase the risk of complications, such as claudication, rest pain, and gangrene.
6. Asthma/COPD: The patient has a history of asthma and COPD, which can increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as bronchospasm and respiratory failure.
7. Prostate Cancer: The patient has a history of prostate cancer, which can increase the risk of complications, such as urinary retention and bladder outlet obstruction.
8. Depression: The patient is taking antidepressant medication, which can increase the risk of side effects, such as sedation and anticholinergic effects.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Cardiac complications, such as heart failure, stroke, and arrhythmias
* Respiratory complications, such as bronchospasm and respiratory failure
* Neurological complications, such as seizures and coma
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea and vomiting
* Renal complications, such as acute kidney injury and electrolyte imbalances
* Infections, such as pneumonia and sepsis
* Bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding and hematoma

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these complications from arising."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 1908**] [**Known lastname 9824**] is a 74 yo Russian-speaking male with h/o ESRD on
   HD, HTN, HL, and CAD who presented with asymptomatic bradycardia.
   .
   # Bradycardia / Rhythm -  Patient with bradycardia consistent with 2nd
   degree AV block as he has sinus node activity with some conduction to
   the ventricles.  He remains asymptomatic with HR's in the 30's-40's at
   this time.  He likely needs a pacemaker.  This may be secondary to
   calcifications since he is on hemodialysis, due to coronary artery
   disease, or possibly hypothyroidism.  Either way, patient would likely
   benefit from PPM.  Access may be difficult for the procedure, as he has
   significant peripheral vascular disease and renal dialysis graft
   complications in the past.
   - Possible PPM today
   - FU EP recs
   - Transcutaneous pacer at bedside
   - Remains NPO after midnight for possible procedure
   - FU TSH level
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   #. Hypertension - Patient hypertensive in the ED and upon reaching the
   CCU.  He reports that his blood pressures always run high after
   dialysis and he is on a number of medications for BP control.
   - Continue lisinopril 20mg po daily, diovan 80mg po daily, amlodipine
   7.5mg po daily, clonidine 0.2mg po daily, and HCTZ 12.5mg po daily
   - Patient due for his morning doses of his BP meds this morning, and
   will titrate up these medications as needed as patient still
   hypertensive
   .
   # CAD -  Patient with history of coronary artery disease (last cath
   [**2155**] showed 50% lesion of ramus intermedius), now presenting with new
   onset bradycardia.  Unlikely CAD as patient without history of chest
   pain.
   - Continue ASA 81mg po daily
   - Have started simvastatin 20mg po daily
   .
   #. Pump - Last echo in [**3-20**] showed mildly depressed systolic function,
   with LVEF=45 and inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis.
   - Will optimally manage pump with blood pressure control
   .
   #. Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V on HD - patient dialyzed today and
   currently electrolytes are within normal limits.  Patient with prior
   graft sites on both left and right side; current dialysis site is
   through left IJ line and vascular surgery does not recommend further
   attempts at grafts in the upper extremities.
   - Consult renal fellow in the morning to continue dialysis MWF while
   patient in house
   - Monitor electrolytes daily and replete aggressively for goal K>4.0
   and Mag>2.0
   - Continue calcium acetate and nephrocaps
   - Will continue ASA 81mg po daily
   .
   #. Peripheral Vascular Disease - patient with significant peripheral
   vascular disease and recently seen by vascular here at [**Hospital1 54**].
   - Will order venous studies as recommended by vascular service here and
   will consult them with questions
   - Continue ASA 81mg po daily
   - Encourage smoking cessation
   # Asthma/COPD -  Patient with long-standing asthma and COPD with
   wheezing at baseline.
   - Continue outpatient inhalers Spiriva and Advair, as well as
   fexofenadine
   .
   #. Prostate cancer -  currently stable and status post-XRT.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old Russian-speaking male with a history of ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, and CAD who presented with asymptomatic bradycardia. He is currently hypertensive and bradycardic, with a heart rate in the 30's-40's. He has a history of coronary artery disease, hypothyroidism, and peripheral vascular disease. He is also diagnosed with asthma/COPD and depression.

The patient's physical examination is significant for diffuse wheezing throughout the lung fields, regular rhythm with bradycardia, and palpable kidneys bilaterally. His abdominal examination is significant for a slightly distended abdomen with a palpable liver shifted due to kidney size.

The patient's lab results show mildly depressed systolic function with an LVEF of 45 and inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis. His electrolytes are within normal limits, and he is currently on dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may worsen, leading to decreased cardiac output and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may continue to worsen, leading to increased cardiac workload, decreased renal function, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient's peripheral vascular disease may worsen, leading to decreased blood flow to the extremities and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V on HD: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen, leading to decreased renal function and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Cardiovascular Disease: The patient's cardiovascular disease may worsen, leading to decreased cardiac output and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to decreased oxygenation and potentially life-threatening complications.

Recommendations:

1. Pacemaker placement: The patient may benefit from pacemaker placement to regulate his heart rate and improve cardiac output.
2. Blood pressure control: The patient's blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled to prevent worsening of his cardiovascular disease.
3. Dialysis: The patient should continue to receive dialysis to manage his chronic kidney disease.
4. Medication management: The patient's medications should be closely monitored and adjusted as necessary to manage his hypertension, bradycardia, and other medical conditions.
5. Cardiovascular rehabilitation: The patient should be referred to a cardiovascular rehabilitation program to improve his cardiac function and overall health.
6. Pulmonary rehabilitation: The patient should be referred to a pulmonary rehabilitation program to improve his respiratory function and overall health.
7. Nutritional counseling: The patient should receive nutritional counseling to improve his diet and overall health.
8. Stress management: The patient should receive stress management counseling to help manage his depression and overall well-being."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Mr. [**Known firstname 1908**] [**Known lastname 9824**] is a 74 yo Russian-speaking male with h/o ESRD on
   HD, HTN, HL, and CAD who presented with asymptomatic bradycardia.
   .
   # Bradycardia / Rhythm -  Patient with bradycardia consistent with 2nd
   degree AV block as he has sinus node activity with some conduction to
   the ventricles.  He remains asymptomatic with HR's in the 30's-40's at
   this time.  Unable to place pacemaker. Will consider OR today or next
   week pending EP recommendations.
   - Possible PPM today or next week.
   - FU EP recs
   - Transcutaneous pacer at bedside
   - Remains NPO after midnight for possible procedure
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   # Chest Pain: EKG without concerning changes. Nitro appeared to
   alleviate. Certainly unstable angina/NSTEMI are concerns in patient
   with known coronary artery disease, significant peripheral vascular
   disease, and chronic kidney disease. Resolved after approx 30 minutes.
   - Repeat EKG this AM.
   - Monitor on Telemetry\
   - Trend CE
   - ASA 81mg
   - Nitro SL PRN pain

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old Russian-speaking male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with asymptomatic bradycardia, which was diagnosed as 2nd degree AV block. He experienced chest pain this morning, which resolved with nitroglycerin. The patient has a history of CAD, significant peripheral vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. He is currently undergoing hemodialysis and has a dialysis catheter in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Unstable Angina/NSTEMI: Given the patient's history of CAD and the recent chest pain, there is a risk of unstable angina or NSTEMI.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may worsen, leading to decreased cardiac output and potential organ dysfunction.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and if not controlled, may lead to further complications such as cardiac damage, stroke, or kidney damage.
4. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient's significant peripheral vascular disease may lead to further complications such as limb ischemia, gangrene, or amputation.
5. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, or uremia.
6. Dialysis Catheter-Related Complications: The patient's dialysis catheter may become infected or occluded, leading to complications such as sepsis, catheter removal, or hemodialysis failure.
7. PPM Complications: The patient's planned pacemaker placement may be complicated by bleeding, infection, or device malfunction.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and blood pressure closely to detect any changes or complications.
2. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension with medications and lifestyle modifications.
3. Optimize the patient's dialysis treatment to minimize complications and ensure proper electrolyte balance.
4. Consider uptitrating the patient's medications to better control his blood pressure and CAD.
5. Monitor the patient's peripheral vascular disease and consider referring him to a vascular specialist for further evaluation and treatment.
6. Continue to educate the patient on smoking cessation and encourage him to quit.
7. Consider referring the patient to a cardiologist or nephrologist for further evaluation and management of his CAD and chronic kidney disease."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old individual with a history of peripheral vascular disease without critical limb ischemia, hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and bradycardia. The patient is currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for further management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98°F, heart rate of 45 bpm, and blood pressure of 158/72 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 12 breaths per minute, and their oxygen saturation is 94% on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient has undergone a right unna boot application today, which will be changed daily while in the hospital. The patient's ABI (ankle-brachial index) is pending, but was unable to be performed due to low heart rate and concern for taking the patient off the floor. The patient's PPM (permanent pacemaker) attempt was unsuccessful, and an epicardial pacemaker is recommended to be performed in the operating room.

The patient has a small hematoma in the subclavian region, which is a complication of the attempted PPM access. A CXR (chest X-ray) did not show any visible pneumothorax or substantial interval change compared to the previous day.

The patient is scheduled to receive hemodialysis tomorrow and has been receiving heparin sodium prophylaxis. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and decreased platelet count.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their unstable condition, and their neurologic examination is incomplete. The patient's skin examination was not performed, and their peripheral vascular examination was limited to the assessment of radial and digital pulses, which were not assessed.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's bradycardia and history of PPM failure may increase their risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD and recent failure to obtain PPM access may worsen their renal function.
3. Infection: The patient's small hematoma in the subclavian region and recent PPM access attempt may increase their risk of infection.
4. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and recent PPM access attempt may increase their risk of bleeding complications.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation may indicate early signs of respiratory failure, which could worsen if not managed promptly.

In conclusion, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their complex medical conditions. Further evaluation and treatment of their PPM failure, hematoma, and renal failure are necessary to improve their clinical outcome."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with asymptomatic bradycardia and was found to have a second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 45-51 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 158/72 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%.

The patient has undergone a series of tests and procedures, including an electrocardiogram (EKG), which showed no concerning changes. He has also been started on nitroglycerin for chest pain, which has resolved. The patient's blood pressures are elevated, and he is being treated with antihypertensive medications.

The patient has a history of CAD, and his EKG shows signs of inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis. He has also been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage V, and is undergoing dialysis. The patient's peripheral vascular disease is significant, and he has undergone a series of vascular procedures.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with diffuse wheezing throughout the lung fields. His neurological status is also stable, with no signs of altered mental status or focal deficits.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and potassium. His hemoglobin and hematocrit are within normal limits.

Based on the patient's condition, the potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may worsen, leading to decreased cardiac output and potential organ failure.
2. Hypertension: The patient's elevated blood pressures may worsen, leading to increased risk of cardiovascular events.
3. CAD: The patient's CAD may worsen, leading to increased risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac death.
4. CKD: The patient's CKD may worsen, leading to increased risk of electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and anemia.
5. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient's peripheral vascular disease may worsen, leading to increased risk of limb loss or amputation.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's diffuse wheezing may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
7. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state may increase his risk of infection, particularly with bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus.

Based on the patient's condition, the following treatment plan is recommended:

1. Continue antihypertensive medications to control blood pressure.
2. Monitor the patient's bradycardia closely and consider placement of a pacemaker if necessary.
3. Continue dialysis to manage the patient's CKD.
4. Monitor the patient's peripheral vascular disease closely and consider angioplasty or bypass surgery if necessary.
5. Continue respiratory support as necessary to manage the patient's respiratory status.
6. Monitor the patient's laboratory results closely and adjust treatment as necessary to manage his electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
7. Consider antibiotic therapy if the patient develops an infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Chest pain this AM. [**2170-5-17**] left anterior chest wall radiated to left
   scapula. No shortness of breath, no diaphoresis, no radiation down the
   arm. Improved with one SL nitrogen x2. Pain resolved within 30 minutes.
   EKG without significant change (small change in V2 from baseline but
   does not appear to represent ST elevation).
   - Vascular took off right unna boot today. Will use adaptic dressing
   with cover sponge and light ace wrap changed daily while in hospital.
   Will call vascular before d/c to place unna boot back on.
   - ABI's; did not do yesterday b/c of low HR and concern for taking off
   of floor.
   - PPM: unable to obtain any access, so could not do PPM. EP recommends
   performing an epicardial pacemaker in the OR
   - Small hematoma in subclavian s/p attempted access in PPM;

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, and CAD, who presented with asymptomatic bradycardia. He has a 2nd-degree AV block and is unable to place a pacemaker. He experienced chest pain this morning, which resolved after 30 minutes with nitroglycerin. His blood pressure is elevated, and he has a history of peripheral vascular disease. He has chronic kidney disease stage V on HD and is scheduled for dialysis today. He also has asthma/COPD, prostate cancer, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Unstable angina/NSTEMI: The patient's chest pain, although resolved, may be a sign of unstable angina or NSTEMI, especially given his history of CAD, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's 2nd-degree AV block may progress to a more severe arrhythmia, such as a complete heart block, which could lead to cardiac arrest.
3. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's elevated blood pressure may worsen, leading to a hypertensive crisis, especially if not properly managed.
4. Chronic kidney disease progression: The patient's chronic kidney disease may progress, leading to further decline in kidney function and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
5. Peripheral vascular disease progression: The patient's peripheral vascular disease may worsen, leading to further complications such as limb ischemia or gangrene.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's asthma/COPD may worsen, leading to respiratory complications such as acute exacerbations or respiratory failure.
7. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state may increase his risk of infection, especially given his history of chronic kidney disease and HD.
8. Depression: The patient's depression may worsen, leading to decreased quality of life and increased risk of complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue monitoring the patient's cardiac rhythm and blood pressure.
2. Consider uptitrating medications to better control blood pressure.
3. Optimize pump management with blood pressure control.
4. Continue dialysis as scheduled and monitor electrolytes daily.
5. Encourage smoking cessation.
6. Continue outpatient inhalers and medications for asthma/COPD.
7. Monitor for signs of infection and depression.
8. Consider consulting with a renal fellow to continue dialysis and optimize management of chronic kidney disease."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 74-year-old Russian-speaking male with a history of ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, and CAD, was admitted to the ICU due to asymptomatic bradycardia. He underwent a successful VDD implant via axillary access, but experienced significant bleeding during the procedure, resulting in a post-procedure HCT of 33. His white count is elevated, likely due to hemoconcentration following HD.

The patient has been experiencing chest pain, which was rated 5-21 on the left anterior chest wall and moved to the left scapula. The pain was alleviated with nitro, and EKG changes were not observed. He has also had intermittent pain associated with the left scapula, which was on and off for a few hours.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, and blood pressure of 150/50 mmHg. He has diffuse wheezing throughout his lung fields, and his abdomen is slightly distended with large kidneys palpable bilaterally.

The patient's lab results show elevated WBC, Hct, and Cr, as well as decreased platelet count. His troponin-T is elevated, but his CK and CKMB are normal. His electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 29.6 mmol/L and magnesium level of 1.9 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Bradycardia/Rhythm: The patient has a 2nd-degree AV block, and a pacemaker was placed yesterday with some bleeding but no other complications. He will be monitored on telemetry and repeat EKGs will be performed.
2. Chest Pain: The patient's chest pain was alleviated with nitro, but he may have unstable angina/NSTEMI due to his known coronary artery disease, significant peripheral vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. He will be monitored for further episodes of chest pain.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures continue to be elevated, and his medications will be uptitrated to better control his blood pressure.
4. CAD: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and presented with new-onset bradycardia and chest pain. He will continue to be monitored for further episodes of chest pain.
5. Pump: The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction is mildly depressed, and he will be optimally managed with blood pressure control.
6. Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V on HD: The patient will continue to be dialyzed three times a week, and his electrolytes will be monitored daily and repleted aggressively for goal K>4.0 and Mag>2.0.
7. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient has significant peripheral vascular disease and will continue to be monitored for further complications.
8. Asthma/COPD: The patient has long-standing asthma and COPD, and he will continue to receive inhalers and albuterol nebs as needed.
9. Prostate Cancer: The patient has stable prostate cancer and will continue to receive treatment as needed.
10. Depression: The patient will continue to receive treatment for depression with citalopram and Aricept.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Unstable angina/NSTEMI: The patient's known coronary artery disease, significant peripheral vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease put him at risk for unstable angina/NSTEMI.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's 2nd-degree AV block and bradycardia put him at risk for further cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's diffuse wheezing throughout his lung fields and history of asthma/COPD put him at risk for respiratory failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease stage V on HD and elevated Cr levels put him at risk for further renal failure.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and history of chronic kidney disease put him at risk for infection.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and ensure his optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 1908**] [**Known lastname 9824**] is a 74 yo Russian-speaking male with h/o ESRD on
   HD, HTN, HL, and CAD who presented with asymptomatic bradycardia.
   .
   # Bradycardia / Rhythm -  Patient with bradycardia consistent with 2nd
   degree AV block as he has sinus node activity with some conduction to
   the ventricles.  He underwent pacemaker placement yesterday with some
   bleeding but no other complications.
   - FU EP recs
   - Transcutaneous pacer at bedside
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   # Chest Pain: EKG without concerning changes. Nitro appeared to
   alleviate. Certainly unstable angina/NSTEMI are concerns in patient
   with known coronary artery disease, significant peripheral vascular
   disease, and chronic kidney disease. Resolved after approx 30 minutes.
   - Repeat EKG this AM
   - Monitor on Telemetry
   - Trend CE
   - ASA 81mg
   - Nitro SL PRN pain
   .
   #. Hypertension
 Blood pressures continue to be elevated 160
 180
   Pressures improved when BP cuff moved to lower extremity.  BP meds held
   this morning for dialysis.
   - Continue lisinopril 20mg po daily, diovan 80mg po daily, amlodipine
   7.5mg po daily, and HCTZ 12.5mg po daily
   - Clonidine changed to 0.2mg po BID
   - Consider uptitrating meds to better control BP.
   .
   # CAD -  Patient with history of coronary artery disease (last cath
   [**2155**] showed 50% lesion of ramus intermedius), now presenting with new
   onset bradycardia.  Some chest pain this morning. Given risk factors
   this may represent CAD.
   - Continue ASA 81mg po daily
   - Simvastatin Increase to 40mg Daily, last LDL 118.
   - Repeat EKG
   - Trend CE
   .
   #. Pump - Last echo in [**3-20**] showed mildly depressed systolic function,
   with LVEF=45 and inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis.
   - Will optimally manage pump with blood pressure control
   .
   #. Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V on HD
 Patient dialyzed yesterday,
   will be dialyzed again Monday.  Patient with prior graft sites on both
   left and right side; current dialysis site is through left IJ line and
   vascular surgery does not recommend further attempts at grafts in the
   upper extremities.
   - Continue dialysis MWF while patient in house per renal

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with asymptomatic bradycardia and was found to have a high-grade atrioventricular (AV) nodal block. He underwent successful pacemaker implantation via axillary access, but experienced bleeding during the procedure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate 62 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure 150/50 mmHg, respiratory rate 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99%.
* Physical examination: The patient is well-appearing, with no signs of distress. He has diffuse wheezing throughout the lung fields, and his abdomen is slightly distended with large kidneys palpable bilaterally.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, with a hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL and a platelet count of 170,000/μL. His creatinine level is 5.6 mg/dL, and his troponin level is 0.34 ng/mL.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Unstable angina or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) due to the patient's known CAD and recent chest pain episode.
2. Hypertensive crisis due to the patient's elevated blood pressure and history of hypertension.
3. Respiratory failure due to the patient's diffuse wheezing and history of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's history of chronic kidney disease and recent bleeding during pacemaker implantation.
5. Infection due to the patient's elevated white blood cell count and history of chronic kidney disease.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's high-grade AV nodal block and history of CAD.
7. Renal failure due to the patient's chronic kidney disease and recent hemodialysis.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Continuing dialysis three times a week
* Managing hypertension with antihypertensive medications
* Optimizing blood pressure control with vasodilators
* Continuing antiplatelet therapy with aspirin
* Managing respiratory symptoms with albuterol nebs and inhalers
* Monitoring electrolytes daily and repleting aggressively for goal potassium >4.0 mmol/L and magnesium >2.0 mmol/L
* Continuing calcium acetate and nephrocaps to manage chronic kidney disease

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 74-year-old male with a history of ESRD, HTN, HL, CAD, and chronic kidney disease, was admitted to the ICU with asymptomatic bradycardia and underwent successful pacemaker placement yesterday. The patient experienced bleeding during the procedure, resulting in a hematocrit of 33. He was started on albuterol nebs and simvastatin, and his blood pressure was controlled with medications. The patient experienced chest pain this morning, which was alleviated with nitroglycerin. He also had intermittent pain in his left scapula that was controlled with tylenol. The patient's vital signs are stable, and his lab results show mild anemia and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Unstable Angina/NSTEMI: The patient's history of CAD, significant peripheral vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease increase his risk for unstable angina/NSTEMI. The chest pain this morning, which was alleviated with nitroglycerin, may indicate ongoing ischemia.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, which may exacerbate his chronic kidney disease and increase his risk for cardiovascular events.
3. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease may progress, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and cardiovascular disease.
4. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient's significant peripheral vascular disease may worsen, leading to further complications such as limb ischemia or gangrene.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's wheezing and mild anemia may increase his risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CAD and mild systolic dysfunction may increase his risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and lab results closely for any signs of instability or deterioration.
2. Continue to optimize the patient's blood pressure control with medications and consider uptitrating medications to better control his blood pressure.
3. Continue to manage the patient's chronic kidney disease with dialysis and electrolyte repletion.
4. Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's peripheral vascular disease, including ABIs and consideration for revascularization procedures.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider further evaluation and management of his wheezing and mild anemia.
6. Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's cardiac status, including consideration for cardiac catheterization or revascularization procedures."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, and CAD who presented with asymptomatic bradycardia and underwent pacemaker placement yesterday. The patient experienced bleeding during the procedure, resulting in a decrease in hematocrit.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 36.7°C, Tcurrent 35.9°C, HR 62 bpm, BP 150/50 mmHg, RR 11 inspirations per minute, SpO2 99%.
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula oxygen delivery, ABG: pH 7.29, pCO2 29 mmHg.
* Physical examination: General appearance is well-appearing, oriented, and comfortable. Chest is moderately tender to palpation at the site of pacemaker insertion. Lungs are clear, and heart rhythm is ventricular paced.

The patient's lab results are as follows:

* WBC: 6.9-13.3 K/uL
* Hct: 31.1-33.5%
* Plt: 170-206 K/uL
* Cr: 5.2-7.5 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.27-0.34 ng/mL
* Glucose: 68-79 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 17.2/30.6/1.5, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 91/0.34, Ca++: 8.5 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 5.0 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Unstable angina/NSTEMI due to the patient's known coronary artery disease and recent chest pain episode.
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's chronic kidney disease and recent wheezing episode.
* Hypertension due to the patient's history of hypertension and recent blood pressure readings.
* Anemia due to the patient's recent bleeding during the pacemaker procedure.
* Depression due to the patient's history of depression and current medication regimen.
* Prostate cancer due to the patient's history of prostate cancer and current treatment status.
* Peripheral vascular disease due to the patient's history of peripheral vascular disease and recent vascular surgery.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitoring of vital signs, lab results, and electrocardiogram (EKG) changes.
* Management of hypertension with medications and blood pressure control.
* Management of anemia with repletion of blood products and iron supplements.
* Management of depression with continued medication regimen and psychological support.
* Management of prostate cancer with continued treatment and follow-up.
* Management of peripheral vascular disease with continued medication regimen and lifestyle modifications.

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: Renal diet
* Glycemic control: Blood sugar checks with chemistries
* Lines: Dialysis catheter and 20-gauge line
* Prophylaxis: Bowel regimen, pain management, and DVT prophylaxis
* Stress ulcer: None
* VAP: NA

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old Russian-speaking male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HL), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of high-grade atrioventricular (AV) nodal block. He underwent a successful VDD implant procedure yesterday via axillary access, with some bleeding during the procedure. Post-procedure, his hematocrit (HCT) was 33, and his white blood cell count was elevated due to hemoconcentration following hemodialysis. He experienced two episodes of chest pain, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, which was alleviated with nitroglycerin. His electrocardiogram (EKG) remains unchanged.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bradycardia/Rhythm: The patient's bradycardia is consistent with 2nd-degree AV block, and he underwent pacemaker placement. However, there is a risk of unstable angina/NSTEMI due to his known CAD, significant peripheral vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.
2. Chest Pain: The patient's chest pain episodes could be indicative of unstable angina/NSTEMI, which is a concern given his known CAD and chronic kidney disease.
3. Anemia: The patient's HCT dropped from 33 to 29.6 after the procedure, which may be due to delayed bleeding.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, which may be due to his chronic kidney disease and need for ongoing management.
5. CAD: The patient's history of CAD and recent chest pain episodes increase his risk of CAD-related complications.
6. Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V on HD: The patient's chronic kidney disease requires ongoing dialysis and electrolyte management.
7. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient's significant peripheral vascular disease increases his risk of complications, such as limb ischemia and gangrene.
8. Asthma/COPD: The patient's wheezing at baseline and recent exacerbation increase his risk of respiratory complications.
9. Depression: The patient's ongoing depression management with citalopram and Aricept may require adjustments to his treatment plan.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's rhythm and cardiac function closely, and adjust his pacemaker settings as necessary.
2. Continue to manage his chest pain with nitroglycerin and monitor for signs of unstable angina/NSTEMI.
3. Recheck his HCT and consider transfusing blood products if necessary.
4. Continue to manage his hypertension with antihypertensive medications and monitor for signs of worsening kidney disease.
5. Consider further evaluation of his CAD with stress testing and coronary angiography.
6. Continue to monitor his chronic kidney disease and adjust his dialysis schedule as necessary.
7. Consider referring the patient to a vascular surgeon for further evaluation and management of his peripheral vascular disease.
8. Continue to monitor his asthma/COPD and adjust his treatment plan as necessary.
9. Consider referring the patient to a psychiatrist for further evaluation and management of his depression."
