   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Currently, patient has a new
   stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. He is awaiting
   catheterization on [**1-24**] for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA
   occlusion. Currently, he is chest pain free, with negative CE
s, but
   refusing EKG.
   - ASA 325mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Plavix 75mg daily
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate to 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg TID when
   tolerating PO
   - Heparin gtt
   - No Integrillin given current Troponin
   - Morphine PRN: chest pain
   - Will continue to try and obtain EKG
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**]. Patient with persistent fluid overload
   on admission, but he was not pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac
   catheterization. On transfer, patient demonstrates mild respiratory
   distress and O2 requirement, limited clinical exam suggests fluid
   overload. Received IV Lasix on transfer with good UOP, but remains
   fluid overloaded this AM.
   - Repeat Lasix 40mg IV x 1 this AM, goal -1L today
   - O2 by NC
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg TID when
   tolerating PO
   - Increase Lisinopril 5mg daily
   # Agitation/Mental status changes: Patient's cardiac catheterization
   aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to significant doses of
   Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has
   been confused and agitated since his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. He
   pulled out his Foley prior to transfer to the [**Hospital1 19**] and his wife
   reports that he was paranoid at [**Location (un) 755**], insisting that the FBI was out
   to get him. At home, however, his wife states that he is not confused,
   but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As patient has been
   attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is not fully
   oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary process
   appears to be agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium.
   Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component
   of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - Psych consult, recommending Ativan 0.5 to 1mg IV q4H:PRN agitation,
   f/u additional recs
   - F/U folate, b12, TSH level this AM
   - Will try to avoid Haldol/Zyprexa as it will further prolong QT
   interval
   - 4 bed rail restraint
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes
   - Preserve sleep wake cycles
   - OOB for meals
   #. Rhythm: Patient in and out of AF in the CCU, but no report of h/o of
   AF. He has also been persistently tachycardic, despite having a regular
   rhythm on admission. This may be agitation paired with diuresis, but
   will continue to monitor closely.
   - On telemetry
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg PO TID when tolerating PO
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   - Gabapentin 600mg PO qHS
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN
   - SW consult
   #. HLD: Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
   #. HTN:
   -Continue Lisinopril 5mg daily
   -Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg PO TID if
   tolerating PO
   #. GERD:
   - Ranitidine 150mg PO BID
   #. Anxiety/Depression:
   - Per psychiatry, appears to be a distant diagnosis.
   - Continue to observe
   #. Hx of TIA: Short-term left hand and leg weakness, now resolved. No
   focal neurologic deficits on admission.
   #. FEN: Cardiac/diabetic, MVI
   #. Access: Patient transferred with right subclavian line in place.
   Unable to pull line secondary to patient agitation, but will attempt to
   place PIV
s and will discontinue the subclavian line when PIV

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: pending cardiac catheterization on [**1-24**]<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 82-year-old male with a history of CABG, DM, and EtOH abuse, who was transferred to the ICU after an aborted cardiac catheterization due to agitation. The patient has a new stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded and is awaiting catheterization on 1-24 for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA occlusion.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Agitated and confused, with a history of agitation and mental status changes since hospitalization
* Refractory to significant doses of Haldol, with a recent attempt to place a PIV line failing due to patient agitation
* Currently receiving IV Ativan and Morphine for agitation and chest pain
* Has a new stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded
* Has a history of NSTEMI/CAD, with a serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] of 0.04
* Has a history of acute on chronic systolic CHF, with an EF of 51% as assessed by nuclear imaging at OSH
* Has a history of EtOH abuse, with a recent hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**] for DT's with EtOH withdrawal
* Has a history of DM, with a current regimen of NPH and insulin sliding scale

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Pneumonia due to the patient's agitation and refusal of PO meds
* Sepsis due to the patient's IV lines and catheters
* Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, MI, or cardiac tamponade due to the patient's history of CAD and recent cardiac catheterization
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's history of respiratory failure and chronic CHF
* GI bleeding due to the patient's history of GERD and stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Infection due to the patient's history of EtOH abuse and recent hospitalization for DT's with EtOH withdrawal
* Complications related to the patient's IV lines and catheters, such as phlebitis or infection
* Complications related to the patient's medications, such as hypotension or tachycardia due to the IV Ativan and Morphine.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, lab results, and medication regimen to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Currently, patient has a new
   stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. He is awaiting
   catheterization on [**1-24**] for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA
   occlusion. Currently, he is chest pain free, with negative CE
s, but
   refusing EKG.
   - ASA 325mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Plavix 75mg daily
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate to 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg TID when
   tolerating PO
   - Heparin gtt
   - No Integrillin given current Troponin
   - Morphine PRN: chest pain
   - Will continue to try and obtain EKG
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**]. Patient with persistent fluid overload
   on admission, but he was not pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac
   catheterization. On transfer, patient demonstrates mild respiratory
   distress and O2 requirement, limited clinical exam suggests fluid
   overload. Received IV Lasix on transfer with good UOP, but remains
   fluid overloaded this AM.
   - Repeat Lasix 40mg IV x 1 this AM, goal -1L today
   - O2 by NC
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg TID when
   tolerating PO
   - Increase Lisinopril 5mg daily
   # Agitation/Mental status changes: Patient's cardiac catheterization
   aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to significant doses of
   Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has
   been confused and agitated since his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. He
   pulled out his Foley prior to transfer to the [**Hospital1 19**] and his wife
   reports that he was paranoid at [**Location (un) 755**], insisting that the FBI was out
   to get him. At home, however, his wife states that he is not confused,
   but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As patient has been
   attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is not fully
   oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary process
   appears to be agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium.
   Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component
   of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - Psych consult, recommending Ativan 0.5 to 1mg IV q4H:PRN agitation
   - Will try to avoid Haldol/Zyprexa as it will further prolong QT
   interval
   - 4 bed rail restraint
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes
   - Preserve sleep wake cycles
   - OOB for meals
   #. Rhythm: Patient in and out of AF in the CCU, but no report of h/o of
   AF. He has also been persistently tachycardic, despite having a regular
   rhythm on admission. This may be agitation paired with diuresis, but
   will continue to monitor closely.
   - On telemetry
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg PO TID when tolerating PO
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   - Gabapentin 600mg PO qHS
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN
   - SW consult
   #. HLD: Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
   #. HTN:
   -Continue Lisinopril 5mg daily
   -Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg PO TID if
   tolerating PO
   #. GERD:
   - Ranitidine 150mg PO BID
   #. Anxiety/Depression:
   - Per psychiatry, appears to be a distant diagnosis.
   - Continue to observe
   #. Hx of TIA: Short-term left hand and leg weakness, now resolved. No
   focal neurologic deficits on admission.
   #. FEN: Cardiac/diabetic, MVI
   #. Access: Patient transferred with right subclavian line in place.
   Unable to pull line secondary to patient agitation, but will attempt to
   place PIV
s and will discontinue the subclavian line when PIV

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Unstable angina or NSTEMI due to occlusion of the SVG-OM1 and LIMA-LAD grafts.
	* Potential for further cardiac damage or death due to lack of complete cardiac catheterization.
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Respiratory failure due to fluid overload and possible pulmonary edema.
	* Increased risk of respiratory distress and need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Neurological complications:
	* Agitation and confusion due to possible benzodiazepine withdrawal, delirium, and/or dementia.
	* Risk of falls, injuries, and further agitation due to patient's attempts to get out of bed and pull at lines.
4. Infection complications:
	* Risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) due to the presence of central lines.
	* Risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
5. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy and potential for bleeding from gastric ulcers.
	* Risk of malnutrition and dehydration due to limited oral intake and potential for gastrointestinal upset.
6. Endocrine complications:
	* Risk of hyperglycemia due to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (HHNS).
	* Risk of hypoglycemia due to insulin therapy and potential for insulin sliding scale errors.
7. Other complications:
	* Risk of falls and injuries due to patient's agitation and attempts to get out of bed.
	* Risk of medication errors due to multiple medications and potential for medication interactions.

To mitigate these potential complications, the patient's care team should:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust therapy as needed.
2. Manage the patient's fluid status and respiratory distress with diuresis and oxygen therapy.
3. Address the patient's agitation and confusion with sedation and behavioral interventions.
4. Implement infection prevention measures, including central line care and VAP prophylaxis.
5. Manage the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms and nutrition with anti-nausea medication and cardiac/diabetic diet.
6. Monitor the patient's endocrine status and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
7. Implement fall prevention measures and monitor the patient's medication regimen to prevent errors."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Currently, patient has a new
   stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. He is awaiting
   catheterization on [**1-24**] for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA
   occlusion. Currently, he is chest pain free, with negative CE
s, but
   refusing EKG.
   - ASA 325mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Plavix 75mg daily
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate to 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg TID when
   tolerating PO
   - Heparin gtt
   - No Integrillin given current Troponin
   - Will continue to try and obtain EKG
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**]. Patient with persistent fluid overload
   on admission, but he was not pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac
   catheterization. On transfer, patient demonstrates mild respiratory
   distress and O2 requirement, limited clinical exam suggests fluid
   overload.
   - Lasix 40mg IV x 1, repeat PRN
   - O2 by NC
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg TID when
   tolerating PO
   - Increase Lisinopril 5mg daily
   # Agitation/Mental status changes: Patient's cardiac catheterization
   aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to significant doses of
   Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has
   been confused and agitated since his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. He
   pulled out his Foley prior to transfer to the [**Hospital1 19**] and his wife
   reports that he was paranoid at [**Location (un) 755**], insisting that the FBI was out
   to get him. At home, however, his wife states that he is not confused,
   but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As patient has been
   attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is not fully
   oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary process
   appears to be agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium.
   Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component
   of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - Psych consult, recommending Ativan 0.5 to 1mg IV q4H:PRN agitation
   - Will try to avoid Haldol/Zyprexa as it will further prolong QT
   interval
   - 4 bed rail restraint
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes
   - Preserve sleep wake cycles
   - OOB for meals
   #. Rhythm: Patient in and out of AF in the CCU, but no report of h/o of
   AF. He has also been persistently tachycardic, despite having a regular
   rhythm on admission. This may be agitation paired with diuresis, but
   will continue to monitor closely.
   - On telemetry
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg PO TID when tolerating PO
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   - Gabapentin 600mg PO qHS
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN
   - SW consult
   #. HLD: Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
   #. HTN:
   -Continue Lisinopril 5mg daily
   -Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg PO TID if
   tolerating PO
   #. GERD:
   - Ranitidine 150mg PO BID
   #. Anxiety/Depression:
   - Per psychiatry, appears to be a distant diagnosis.
   - Continue to observe
   #. Hx of TIA: Short-term left hand and leg weakness, now resolved. No
   focal neurologic deficits on admission.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, and NSTEMI, who was transferred to the ICU from the emergency department due to respiratory failure and NSTEMI. He was previously hospitalized at another facility for cardiac catheterization, which was aborted due to agitation. The patient has been experiencing agitation, confusion, and chest pain, and has refused to take oral medications. He has a new stent in the SVG-OM1 and is awaiting further cardiac catheterization.

The patient's current medications include ASA, Atorvastatin, Plavix, Metoprolol Tartrate, Heparin, and Lasix. He has also been receiving IV Ativan and Morphine for agitation and pain.

Physical examination reveals stable vital signs, but the patient is not fully oriented and is experiencing agitation and confusion. His peripheral vascular examination is incomplete due to agitation.

Laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, and his cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 and LIMA-LAD grafts. His blood work shows elevated glucose and creatinine levels.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's NSTEMI and occlusion of the SVG-OM1 and LIMA-LAD grafts increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure and requirement for oxygen therapy increase his risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and respiratory arrest.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's agitation, confusion, and delirium increase his risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, and neurological deficits.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of central lines increase his risk of infection, such as sepsis, pneumonia, and line infections.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload and requirement for diuretics increase his risk of fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and cardiac complications.
6. Benzodiazepine withdrawal: The patient's history of EtOH abuse and benzodiazepine use increase his risk of benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of EtOH abuse and gastrointestinal disease increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding, perforation, and obstruction.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires continued close monitoring and management of his cardiac, respiratory, and neurological status. He will continue to receive IV Ativan and Morphine for agitation and pain, and will be evaluated for cardiac catheterization on [**1-24**]. He will also be continued on his current medications and will be monitored for signs of cardiac complications, respiratory failure, and neurological deficits."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Currently, patient has a new
   stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. He is awaiting
   catheterization on [**1-24**] for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA
   occlusion. Currently, he is chest pain free, with negative CE
s, but
   refusing EKG.
   - ASA 325mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Plavix 75mg daily
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate 37.5mg TID
   - Heparin gtt
   - No Integrillin given current Troponin
   - Will continue to try and obtain EKG
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**]. Patient with persistent fluid overload
   on admission, but he was not pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac
   catheterization. On transfer, patient demonstrates mild respiratory
   distress and O2 requirement, limited clinical exam suggests fluid
   overload.
   - Lasix 40mg IV x 1, repeat PRN
   - O2 by NC
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate 37.5mg TID
   - Increase Lisinopril 5mg daily
   # Agitation/Mental status changes: Patient's cardiac catheterization
   aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to significant doses of
   Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has
   been confused and agitated since his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. He
   pulled out his Foley prior to transfer to the [**Hospital1 19**] and his wife
   reports that he was paranoid at [**Location (un) 755**], insisting that the FBI was out
   to get him. At home, however, his wife states that he is not confused,
   but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As patient has been
   attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is not fully
   oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary process
   appears to be agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium.
   Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component
   of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - Psych consult, recommending Ativan 0.5 to 1mg IV q4H:PRN agitation
   - Will try to avoid Haldol/Zyprexa as it will further prolong QT
   interval
   - 4 bed rail restraint
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes
   - Preserve sleep wake cycles
   - OOB for meals
   #. Rhythm: Patient in and out of AF in the CCU, but no report of h/o of
   AF. He has also been persistently tachycardic, despite having a regular
   rhythm on admission. This may be agitation paired with diuresis, but
   will continue to monitor closely.
   - On telemetry
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 37.5mg PO TID
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   - Gabapentin 600mg PO qHS
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component
   of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - Psych consult, recommending Ativan 0.5 to 1mg IV q4H:PRN agitation
   - Will try to avoid Haldol/Zyprexa as it will further prolong QT
   interval
   - 4 bed rail restraint
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes
   - Preserve sleep wake cycles
   - OOB for meals
   #. Rhythm: Patient in and out of AF in the CCU, but no report of h/o of
   AF. He has also been persistently tachycardic, despite having a regular
   rhythm on admission. This may be agitation paired with diuresis, but
   will continue to monitor closely.
   - On telemetry
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 37.5mg PO TID
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   - Gabapentin 600mg PO qHS
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN
   - SW consult
   #. HLD: Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is an 82-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting, diabetes mellitus, and ethanol abuse. He was transferred to the ICU after an aborted cardiac catheterization due to agitation. The patient's cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 and LIMA-LAD grafts, and he was placed on a new stent in the SVG-OM1.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Agitation and confusion, with minimal improvement despite IV Ativan and Morphine
* Refusal of PO medications and EKG
* Persistent fluid overload and respiratory distress
* Mild systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 51%
* Tachycardia, possibly related to agitation and diuresis
* Diabetes mellitus, with ongoing management with NPH and insulin sliding scale
* Ethanol abuse, with a history of delirium tremens and benzodiazepine withdrawal
* Heparin infusion for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Troponin elevation, suggestive of NSTEMI
* Creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL
* Glucose level of 187 mg/dL
* Hemoglobin level of 13.5 g/dL
* White blood cell count of 12,000 cells/mm3

The patient's medication regimen includes:

* Heparin infusion
* Metoprolol Tartrate 37.5mg PO TID
* Lisinopril 5mg daily
* Atorvastatin 80mg daily
* Lasix 40mg IV x 1, repeat PRN
* Ranitidine 150mg PO BID
* IV Ativan 0.5-1mg q4H:PRN
* NPH and insulin sliding scale for glycemic control

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiac complications, such as recurrent angina, heart failure, or arrhythmias
* Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure
* Neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation
* Infection, particularly given the patient's immunocompromised state
* Benzodiazepine withdrawal, which may lead to seizures or other withdrawal symptoms
* Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, given the patient's history of ethanol abuse and immobility."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's 24-hour events indicate agitation, confusion, and refusal of PO meds. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 100/66 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated glucose levels (187 mg/dL), potassium levels (4.6 mEq/L), and creatinine levels (1.1 mg/dL).

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Hyperglycemia: Prolonged hyperglycemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, increased risk of infections, and worsening of underlying medical conditions.
2. Hypokalemia: Potassium levels below 3.5 mEq/L can cause muscle weakness, fatigue, and cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Acute kidney injury: Elevated creatinine levels may indicate acute kidney injury, which can progress to chronic kidney disease if left untreated.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of -1,164 mL, which may indicate fluid overload, increasing the risk of cardiac failure and respiratory distress.
5. Agitation and delirium: The patient's agitation and confusion may be indicative of delirium, which can increase the risk of falls, injury, and prolonged ICU stay.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's heart rhythm is stable, but the elevated blood pressure may indicate hypertension, which can increase the risk of cardiac complications.
7. Respiratory compromise: The patient's oxygen saturation is 94%, but the ABG result shows a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 28 mmHg, which may indicate respiratory compromise.

To address these potential complications, the patient should receive close monitoring, aggressive management of hyperglycemia and hypokalemia, and optimization of fluid balance. The patient's cardiovascular and respiratory status should be closely monitored, and adjustments made to their medication regimen as necessary."

Summary:

The patient is a 72-inch tall male with a weight of 104.6 kg, who is currently in the ICU due to altered mental status, myocardial infarction (AMI), and acute coronary syndrome. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 100/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) shows sinus rhythm, and the patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated.

The patient has been agitated and confused, requiring sedation with IV Ativan and morphine. The patient's agitation has been managed with IV Ativan and morphine, and the patient's vital signs have remained stable.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating myocardial infarction. The patient's other laboratory results, including complete blood count, electrolyte panel, and liver function tests, are within normal limits.

The patient's medication list includes Heparin Sodium, Haloperidol, Furosemide, Ranitidine, Lorazepam, and Morphine Sulfate. The patient is also receiving IV fluids and oxygen therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's myocardial infarction increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's altered mental status and sedation may increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia and respiratory failure.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be due to delirium, which can be caused by medications, infections, or other underlying medical conditions.
4. Worsening of cardiac function: The patient's myocardial infarction may worsen cardiac function, leading to heart failure or cardiac arrest.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's use of anticoagulant therapy with Heparin Sodium increases the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and sedation may increase the risk of infection, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's use of anticoagulant therapy and sedation may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.

Based on the patient's condition and potential medical complications, close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Currently, patient has a new
   stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. He is awaiting
   catheterization on [**1-24**] for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA
   occlusion. Currently, he is chest pain free, with negative CE
s, but
   refusing EKG.
   - ASA 325mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Plavix 75mg daily
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate to 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg TID when
   tolerating PO
   - Heparin gtt
   - No Integrillin given current Troponin
   - Morphine PRN: chest pain
   - Will continue to try and obtain EKG
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**]. Patient with persistent fluid overload
   on admission, but he was not pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac
   catheterization. On transfer, patient demonstrates mild respiratory
   distress and O2 requirement, limited clinical exam suggests fluid
   overload. Received IV Lasix on transfer with good UOP, but remains
   fluid overloaded this AM.
   - TTE today
   - Repeat Lasix 40mg IV x 1 this AM, goal -1L today
   - O2 by NC
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg TID when
   tolerating PO
   - Increase Lisinopril 5mg daily
   # Agitation/Mental status changes: Patient's cardiac catheterization
   aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to significant doses of
   Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has
   been confused and agitated since his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. He
   pulled out his Foley prior to transfer to the [**Hospital1 19**] and his wife
   reports that he was paranoid at [**Location (un) 755**], insisting that the FBI was out
   to get him. At home, however, his wife states that he is not confused,
   but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As patient has been
   attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is not fully
   oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary process
   appears to be agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium.
   Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component
   of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - Psych consult, recommending Ativan 0.5 to 1mg IV q4H:PRN agitation,
   f/u additional recs
   - F/U folate, b12, TSH level this AM
   - Will try to avoid Haldol/Zyprexa as it will further prolong QT
   interval
   - 4 bed rail restraint
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes
   - Preserve sleep wake cycles
   - OOB for meals
   #. Rhythm: Patient in and out of AF in the CCU, but no report of h/o of
   AF. He has also been persistently tachycardic, despite having a regular
   rhythm on admission. This may be agitation paired with diuresis, but
   will continue to monitor closely.
   - On telemetry
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg PO TID when tolerating PO
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   - Gabapentin 600mg PO qHS
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN
   - SW consult
   #. HLD: Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
   #. HTN:
   -Continue Lisinopril 5mg daily
   -Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg PO TID if
   tolerating PO
   #. GERD:
   - Ranitidine 150mg PO BID
   #. Anxiety/Depression:
   - Per psychiatry, appears to be a distant diagnosis.
   - Continue to observe
   #. Hx of TIA: Short-term left hand and leg weakness, now resolved. No
   focal neurologic deficits on admission.
   #. FEN: Cardiac/diabetic, MVI
   #. Access: Patient transferred with right subclavian line in place.
   Unable to pull line secondary to patient agitation, but will attempt to
   place PIV
s and will discontinue the subclavian line when PIV
s placed

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Currently, patient has a new
   stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. He is awaiting
   catheterization on [**1-24**] for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA
   occlusion. Currently, he is chest pain free, with negative CE
s, but
   refusing EKG.
   - ASA 325mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Plavix 75mg daily
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate to 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg TID when
   tolerating PO
   - Heparin gtt
   - No Integrillin given current Troponin
   - Morphine PRN: chest pain
   - Will continue to try and obtain EKG
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**]. Patient with persistent fluid overload
   on admission, but he was not pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac
   catheterization. On transfer, patient demonstrates mild respiratory
   distress and O2 requirement, limited clinical exam suggests fluid
   overload. Received IV Lasix on transfer with good UOP, but remains
   fluid overloaded this AM.
   - TTE today
   - Repeat Lasix 40mg IV x 1 this AM, goal -1L today
   - O2 by NC
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg TID when
   tolerating PO
   - Increase Lisinopril 5mg daily
   # Agitation/Mental status changes: Patient's cardiac catheterization
   aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to significant doses of
   Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has
   been confused and agitated since his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. He
   pulled out his Foley prior to transfer to the [**Hospital1 19**] and his wife
   reports that he was paranoid at [**Location (un) 755**], insisting that the FBI was out
   to get him. At home, however, his wife states that he is not confused,
   but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As patient has been
   attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is not fully
   oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary process
   appears to be agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium.
   Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component
   of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - Psych consult, recommending Ativan 0.5 to 1mg IV q4H:PRN agitation,
   f/u additional recs
   - F/U folate, b12, TSH level this AM
   - Will try to avoid Haldol/Zyprexa as it will further prolong QT
   interval
   - 4 bed rail restraint
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes
   - Preserve sleep wake cycles
   - OOB for meals
   #. Rhythm: Patient in and out of AF in the CCU, but no report of h/o of
   AF. He has also been persistently tachycardic, despite having a regular
   rhythm on admission. This may be agitation paired with diuresis, but
   will continue to monitor closely.
   - On telemetry
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg PO TID when tolerating PO
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   - Gabapentin 600mg PO qHS
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN
   - SW consult
   #. HLD: Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
   #. HTN:
   -Continue Lisinopril 5mg daily
   -Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg PO TID if
   tolerating PO
   #. GERD:
   - Ranitidine 150mg PO BID
   #. Anxiety/Depression:
   - Per psychiatry, appears to be a distant diagnosis.
   - Continue to observe
   #. Hx of TIA: Short-term left hand and leg weakness, now resolved. No
   focal neurologic deficits on admission.
   #. FEN: Cardiac/diabetic, MVI
   #. Access: Patient transferred with right subclavian line in place.
   Unable to pull line secondary to patient agitation, but will attempt to

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of CABG, DM, and EtOH abuse, admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and NSTEMI. He was transferred from another hospital after an aborted cardiac catheterization due to agitation. The patient's current condition is characterized by agitation, confusion, and refusal of PO meds, with a new stent in the SVG-OM1 graft. He is awaiting catheterization on [**1-24**] for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA occlusion.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* NSTEMI/CAD: The patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are concerning for unstable angina, and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of NSTEMI. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 and LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented completion of cardiac catheterization.
	* Acute on chronic systolic CHF: The patient has persistent fluid overload, and received IV Lasix on transfer with good UOP, but remains fluid overloaded this AM.
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Respiratory failure: The patient was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, and currently requires O2 by NC.
3. Neurological complications:
	* Agitation/Mental status changes: The patient's primary process appears to be agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium. He is attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation.
	* Rhythm: The patient is in and out of AF, and has been persistently tachycardic, despite having a regular rhythm on admission.
4. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* GERD: The patient has a history of GERD, and is currently taking Ranitidine 150mg PO BID.
5. Endocrine complications:
	* DM: The patient has a history of DM, and is currently taking NPH and insulin sliding scale from OSH.
6. Infection complications:
	* DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT, and is receiving Heparin gtt prophylaxis.
7. Nutritional complications:
	* Malnutrition: The patient is on a cardiac/diabetic diet, and may be at risk for malnutrition due to his chronic conditions.

These potential medical complications require close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve the patient's outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Currently, patient has a new
   stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. He is awaiting
   catheterization on [**1-24**] for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA
   occlusion. Currently, he is chest pain free, with negative CE
s, but
   refusing EKG.
   - ASA 325mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Plavix 75mg daily
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate to 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg TID when
   tolerating PO
   - Heparin gtt
   - No Integrillin given current Troponin
   - Morphine PRN: chest pain
   - Will continue to try and obtain EKG
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**]. Patient with persistent fluid overload
   on admission, but he was not pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac
   catheterization. On transfer, patient demonstrates mild respiratory
   distress and O2 requirement, limited clinical exam suggests fluid
   overload. Received IV Lasix on transfer with good UOP, but remains
   fluid overloaded this AM.
   - TTE today
   - Repeat Lasix 40mg IV x 1 this AM, as patient is incontinent will
   gauge fluid status by exam
   - PM electrolytes & replete PRN
   - O2 by NC
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg TID when
   tolerating PO
   - Increase Lisinopril 5mg daily
   # Agitation/Mental status changes: Patient's cardiac catheterization
   aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to significant doses of
   Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has
   been confused and agitated since his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. He
   pulled out his Foley prior to transfer to the [**Hospital1 19**] and his wife
   reports that he was paranoid at [**Location (un) 755**], insisting that the FBI was out
   to get him. At home, however, his wife states that he is not confused,
   but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As patient has been
   attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is not fully
   oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary process
   appears to be agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium.
   Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component
   of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - Psych consult, recommending Ativan 0.5 to 1mg IV q4H:PRN agitation,
   f/u additional recs
   - F/U folate, b12, TSH level this AM
   - CXR, U/A to rule out typical infectious causes
   - Will try to avoid Haldol/Zyprexa as it will further prolong QT
   interval
   - 4 bed rail restraint
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes
   - Preserve sleep wake cycles
   - OOB for meals
   #. Rhythm: Patient in and out of AF in the CCU, but no report of h/o of
   AF. He has also been persistently tachycardic, despite having a regular
   rhythm on admission. This may be agitation paired with diuresis, but
   will continue to monitor closely.
   - On telemetry
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg PO TID when tolerating PO
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   - Gabapentin 600mg PO qHS
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN
   - SW consult
   #. HLD: Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
   #. HTN:
   -Continue Lisinopril 5mg daily
   -Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg PO TID if
   tolerating PO
   #. GERD:
   - Ranitidine 150mg PO BID
   #. Anxiety/Depression:
   - Per psychiatry, appears to be a distant diagnosis.
   - Continue to observe
   #. Hx of TIA: Short-term left hand and leg weakness, now resolved. No
   focal neurologic deficits on admission.
   #. FEN: Cardiac/diabetic, MVI
   #. Access: Patient transferred with right subclavian line in place.

   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is moderate global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %). The aortic valve leaflets are
   moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area
   1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular cavity
   enlargement with moderate global hypokinesis. Mild aortic valve
   stenosis. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: Patient
   became tachypneic to 40's with pC02 of 59 and HCO of 35 (pH 7.37),
   became progressively somnolent. Was intubated. Unclear what the cause
   of his disorders are: he is retaining CO2, likely because he is so
   tachypneic as to only ventillate his deadspace, he could also have a
   PNA that affects his gas exchange. he is hyperbicarbic because he was
   aggressively diuresed. The intubation will also facilitate a workup of
   his other severe medical problems - AMS, CAB and possible PNA
   - fent/versed sedation
   - abgs for now as ALine could not be placed
   - VAP bundle
   - may need to involve renal for help with understanding metabolic
   disorder
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes: Patient's cardiac catheterization
   aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to significant doses of
   Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has
   been confused and agitated since his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. He
   pulled out his Foley prior to transfer to the [**Hospital1 19**] and his wife
   reports that he was paranoid at [**Location (un) 755**], insisting that the FBI was out
   to get him. At home, however, his wife states that he is not confused,
   but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As patient has been
   attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is not fully
   oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary process
   appears to be agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium.
   Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component
   of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Psych evaluated and agreed with haldol
   for restraints. Normal folate/b12/tsh. As of [**1-24**], infectious etiology
   still likely with suggestive UA and CXR
   - Psych consult, following
   - haldol for chemical restraints after off sedation
   - 4 bed rail restraint
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes as possible
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Currently, patient has a new
   stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. He was awaiting
   catheterization on [**1-24**] for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA
   occlusion. He was chest pain free without EKG changes as of [**1-24**].
   - ASA 325mg daily, Atorvastatin 80mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily
   - Increase Metoprolol Tartrate to 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg TID when
   tolerating PO
   - Heparin gtt
   - No Integrillin given current Troponin
   - Morphine PRN: chest pain
   - may be able to go for cath while intubated/sedated
    .
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis
   - O2 by NC
   -Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg TID when tolerating PO
   -Lisinopril 5mg daily
   .
   #. Rhythm: Patient in and out of AF in the CCU, but no report of h/o of
   AF. He has also been persistently tachycardic, despite having a regular
   rhythm on admission. This may be agitation paired with diuresis, but
   will continue to monitor closely.
   - On telemetry
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg PO TID when tolerating PO
   .
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   - Gabapentin 600mg PO qHS
   .
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN
   - SW consult
   .
   #. HLD: Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
   .
   #. HTN:
   -Continue Lisinopril 5mg daily
   -Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 10mg IV q6H or 37.5mg PO TID if
   tolerating PO
   .
    #. GERD:
   - Ranitidine 150mg PO BID
   .
   #. Anxiety/Depression:
   - Per psychiatry, appears to be a distant diagnosis.
   - Continue to observe
   .
   #. Hx of TIA: Short-term left hand and leg weakness, now resolved.
   Possibly rigid on left arm
   #. FEN: Cardiac/diabetic, MVI
   #. Access: Patient transferred with right subclavian line in place.
   Unable to pull line secondary to patient agitation, but will attempt to
   place PIV
s and will discontinue the subclavian line when PIV
s placed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of CABG, DM, and EtOH abuse, who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and NSTEMI. He was intubated due to respiratory distress and has a complex metabolic disturbance. He has a history of agitation, and his primary process appears to be agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium. He has a new stent in the SVG-OM1 and is awaiting catheterization for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA occlusion.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and intubation may lead to further complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated lung injury, and respiratory acidosis.
2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis and respiratory acidosis may lead to further complications such as arrhythmias, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's NSTEMI and occlusion of the SVG-OM1 and LIMA-LAD grafts may lead to further complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
4. Infection: The patient's UTI and possible PNA may lead to further complications such as sepsis, organ failure, and death.
5. Agitation and delirium: The patient's agitation and delirium may lead to further complications such as falls, injuries, and increased risk of mortality.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of EtOH abuse and possible benzodiazepine withdrawal may lead to further complications such as pancreatitis, gastritis, and GI bleeding.
7. Renal complications: The patient's history of DM and possible fluid overload may lead to further complications such as acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's history of TIA and possible MVI may lead to further complications such as stroke, seizure, and cognitive impairment.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory, metabolic, and cardiac status. He needs to be sedated and ventilated to manage his respiratory distress and agitation. He requires antibiotics for his UTI and possible PNA, and he needs to be evaluated for possible benzodiazepine withdrawal. He also needs to be managed for his cardiac complications, including his NSTEMI and occlusion of the SVG-OM1 and LIMA-LAD grafts. Additionally, he needs to be monitored for potential gastrointestinal, renal, and neurological complications."

   CT chest [**2182-1-24**]: Bilateral non-hemorrhagic layering pleural effusions,
   larger on the right side are associated with adjacent lung atelectasis.
   Assymetry between the consolidation in the left lower lobe and the
   pleural effusions suggest the presence of atelectasis and pneumonia.
   Mild smooth interlobular septal thickening associated with ground glass
   opacities in the upper lobe is consistent with mild interstitial
   pulmonary edema. There are few scattered calcified granulomas.
   CT head [**2182-1-24**]: 5mm age-indeterminate infarct in the anterior limb of
   the right internal capsule. Recommend MR for further characterization.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: Patient
   intubated on [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and
   low-grade fever. CT chest demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and
   bilateral pleural effusions. Started on Vancomycin & Cefepime
   empirically. Urine culture from [**2182-1-23**] negative. ABG
s improved this
   AM.
   - F/u Sputum culture & blood cultures from [**2182-1-24**]
   - IV Vancomycin, day 3
   - Cefepime, day 3
   - Frequent ABG
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes: Patient's cardiac catheterization
   aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to significant doses of
   Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has
   been confused and agitated since his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At
   home, however, his wife states that he is not confused, but does
   exhibit short-term memory impairments. As patient has been attempting
   to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is not fully oriented despite
   repeated verbal reorientation, his primary process appears to be
   agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium. Patient also
   takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component of
   benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic work-up as an inpatient. CT
   head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar infarct of indeterminate age,
   so neurology was consulted.  Infection and CVA may be complicating
   already complex delirium and dementia picture.
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - F/U Psych recs
   - Haldol for chemical restraints once extubated
   - 4 bed rail restraint
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes as possible
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Currently, patient has a new
   stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. He was awaiting
   catheterization on [**1-24**] for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA
   occlusion. He was chest pain free without EKG changes as of [**1-24**].
   - ASA 325mg daily, Atorvastatin 80mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily
   - Metoprolol Tartrate  37.5mg TID when tolerating PO
   - Morphine PRN: chest pain
   - [**Month (only) 51**] be able to go for cath while intubated/sedated, will discuss with
   attending
    .
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 37.5mg TID when tolerating PO
   - Lisinopril PO 5mg daily when tolerating PO
   .
   #. Rhythm: Patient in normal sinus rhythm. Prior report of AF was
   likely telemetry static.
   - On telemetry
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 37.5mg PO TID when tolerating PO
   .
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.  Home
   Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   .
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN
   - SW consult
   .
   #. HLD: Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
   .
   #. HTN:
   -Continue Lisinopril 5mg PO daily when tolerating PO
   -Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 37.5mg PO TID if tolerating PO
   .
    #. GERD:
   - Lansoprazole 30mg daily
   .
   #. Anxiety/Depression:
   - Per psychiatry, appears to be a distant diagnosis.
   - Continue to observe
   .
   #. Hx of TIA: Short-term left hand and leg weakness, now resolved.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   # Agitation/Mental status changes: Patient's cardiac catheterization
   aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to significant doses of
   Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has
   been confused and agitated since his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At
   home, however, his wife states that he is not confused, but does
   exhibit short-term memory impairments. As patient has been attempting
   to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is not fully oriented despite
   repeated verbal reorientation, his primary process appears to be
   agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium. Patient also
   takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component of
   benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic work-up as an inpatient. CT
   head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar infarct of indeterminate age,
   so neurology was consulted.  Infection and CVA may be complicating
   already complex delirium and dementia picture.

   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Currently, patient has a new
   stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. He was awaiting
   catheterization on [**1-24**] for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA
   occlusion. He was chest pain free without EKG changes as of [**1-24**].

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old man admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, NSTEMI, and agitation. He was transferred from another hospital after an aborted cardiac catheterization due to agitation. He has a history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, and TIA. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. He has a central line and arterial line in place. His labs show mild anemia, elevated WBC count, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is complicated by his pneumonia, pleural effusions, and interstitial pulmonary edema. He may require further respiratory support, such as increasing the PEEP or adding inhaled corticosteroids.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's NSTEMI and occluded grafts increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias. He may require further cardiac work-up, including echocardiogram and stress test.
3. Neurological Complications: The patient's age-indeterminate infarct in the right internal capsule may increase his risk of further neurological complications, such as stroke or cognitive decline. He may require further neurological work-up, including MRI and neuropsychological evaluation.
4. Infectious Complications: The patient's pneumonia and pleural effusions increase his risk of developing further infections, such as sepsis or ventilator-associated pneumonia. He may require further antibiotic therapy and monitoring for signs of infection.
5. Metabolic Complications: The patient's diabetes and EtOH abuse increase his risk of developing metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia or electrolyte imbalances. He may require further monitoring and management of his blood glucose and electrolyte levels.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's GERD and history of EtOH abuse increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as gastritis or bleeding. He may require further monitoring and management of his gastrointestinal symptoms.
7. Psychiatric Complications: The patient's history of EtOH abuse and recent withdrawal may increase his risk of developing psychiatric complications, such as depression or anxiety. He may require further psychiatric evaluation and management.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, infectious, metabolic, gastrointestinal, and psychiatric complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Mild smooth interlobular septal thickening associated with ground glass
   opacities in the upper lobe is consistent with mild interstitial

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: Patient
   intubated on [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and
   low-grade fever. CT chest demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and
   bilateral pleural effusions. Started on Vancomycin & Cefepime
   empirically. Urine culture from [**2182-1-23**] negative. ABG
s improved this
   AM.
   - F/u Sputum culture & blood cultures from [**2182-1-24**]
   - IV Vancomycin, day 3
   - Cefepime, day 3
   - Frequent ABG
   - Will hold off on weaning vent until patient returns from
   catheterization
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes: Patient's cardiac catheterization
   aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to significant doses of
   Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has
   been confused and agitated since his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At
   home, however, his wife states that he is not confused, but does
   exhibit short-term memory impairments. As patient has been attempting
   to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is not fully oriented despite
   repeated verbal reorientation, his primary process appears to be
   agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium. Patient also
   takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component of
   benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic work-up as an inpatient. CT
   head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar infarct of indeterminate age,
   so neurology was consulted.  Infection and CVA may be complicating
   already complex delirium and dementia picture.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 82-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), ethanol abuse, and a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA). The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Respiratory distress with left lower lobe pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Agitation and mental status changes, likely due to delirium, dementia, and possible benzodiazepine withdrawal.
3. NSTEMI with occlusion of the SVG-OM1 and LIMA-LAD grafts, and a new stent in the SVG-OM1.
4. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure (CHF) with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 30-35%.
5. Hypertension, currently requiring pressors.
6. Diabetes mellitus, requiring insulin and sliding scale therapy.
7. Ethanol abuse, with a history of detoxification and withdrawal.
8. History of TIA, with possible residual left arm rigidity.

The patient's laboratory results show:

1. Elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, suggesting an inflammatory response.
2. Elevated troponin levels, consistent with myocardial infarction.
3. Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), including elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels.
4. Abnormal kidney function tests (KFTs), including elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels.

The patient's medications include:

1. Vancomycin and cefepime for pneumonia.
2. Heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.
3. Lansoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
4. Metoprolol tartrate for hypertension and heart failure.
5. Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia.
6. Insulin and sliding scale therapy for diabetes mellitus.
7. IV Ativan for agitation and anxiety.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure due to pneumonia and pleural effusions.
2. Sepsis and septic shock due to pneumonia and possible secondary infections.
3. Heart failure exacerbation due to CHF and possible cardiac tamponade.
4. Stroke or transient ischemic attack due to cardiac catheterization complications.
5. DVT or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and possible thrombosis.
6. Infection or sepsis due to central line or urinary tract infections.
7. Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome due to possible benzodiazepine dependence.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue antibiotics for pneumonia.
2. Monitor for signs of sepsis and septic shock.
3. Optimize heart failure treatment, including diuresis and vasodilators.
4. Consider cardiac catheterization to evaluate and treat the LIMA-LAD graft occlusion.
5. Monitor for signs of stroke or transient ischemic attack.
6. Continue DVT prophylaxis with heparin.
7. Monitor for signs of infection or sepsis.
8. Consider benzodiazepine tapering and withdrawal management.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his complex medical conditions, including respiratory, cardiac, and neurological issues."

   CT chest [**2182-1-24**]: Bilateral non-hemorrhagic layering pleural effusions,
   larger on the right side are associated with adjacent lung atelectasis.
   Assymetry between the consolidation in the left lower lobe and the
   pleural effusions suggest the presence of atelectasis and pneumonia.
   Mild smooth interlobular septal thickening associated with ground glass
   opacities in the upper lobe is consistent with mild interstitial
   pulmonary edema. There are few scattered calcified granulomas.
   CT head [**2182-1-24**]: 5mm age-indeterminate infarct in the anterior limb of
   the right internal capsule. Recommend MR for further characterization.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: Patient
   intubated on [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and
   low-grade fever. CT chest demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and
   bilateral pleural effusions. Started on Vancomycin & Cefepime
   empirically. Urine culture from [**2182-1-23**] negative. ABG
s improved this
   AM.
   - F/u Sputum culture & blood cultures from [**2182-1-24**]
   - IV Vancomycin, day 3
   - Cefepime, day 3
   - Frequent ABG
   - Will hold off on weaning vent until patient returns from
   catheterization
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes: Patient's cardiac catheterization
   aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to significant doses of
   Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has
   been confused and agitated since his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At
   home, however, his wife states that he is not confused, but does
   exhibit short-term memory impairments. As patient has been attempting
   to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is not fully oriented despite
   repeated verbal reorientation, his primary process appears to be
   agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium. Patient also
   takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component of
   benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic work-up as an inpatient. CT
   head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar infarct of indeterminate age,
   so neurology was consulted.  Infection and CVA may be complicating
   already complex delirium and dementia picture.
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - F/U Psych recs
   - Haldol for chemical restraints once extubated
   - 4 bed rail restraint
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes as possible
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Currently, patient has a new
   stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. He was awaiting
   catheterization on [**1-24**] for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA
   occlusion. He was chest pain free without EKG changes as of [**1-24**].

   - [**Month (only) 51**] be able to go for cath while intubated/sedated, will discuss with
   attending
    .
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 37.5mg TID when bp

   #. Rhythm: Patient in normal sinus rhythm. Prior report of AF was
   likely telemetry static.
   - On telemetry
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 37.5mg PO TID when bp

   .
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.  Home
   Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   .
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN when extubated
   - SW consult
   .
   #. HLD: Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
   .
   #. HTN:  Currently hypotensive, requiring pressors.
   -Continue Lisinopril 5mg PO daily when bp
s tolerate
   -Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 37.5mg PO TID when bp
s tolerate
   .
    #. GERD:
   - Lansoprazole 30mg daily
   .
   #. Anxiety/Depression:
   - Per psychiatry, appears to be a distant diagnosis.
   - Continue to observe
   .
   #. Hx of TIA: Short-term left hand and leg weakness, now resolved.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   CT chest [**2182-1-24**]: Bilateral non-hemorrhagic layering pleural effusions,
   larger on the right side are associated with adjacent lung atelectasis.
   Assymetry between the consolidation in the left lower lobe and the
   pleural effusions suggest the presence of atelectasis and pneumonia.
   Mild smooth interlobular septal thickening associated with ground glass
   opacities in the upper lobe is consistent with mild interstitial
   pulmonary edema. There are few scattered calcified granulomas.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: Patient
   intubated on [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and
   low-grade fever. CT chest demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and
   bilateral pleural effusions. Started on Vancomycin & Cefepime
   empirically. Urine culture from [**2182-1-23**] negative. ABG
s improved this
   AM.
   - F/u Sputum culture & blood cultures from [**2182-1-24**]
   - IV Vancomycin, day 3
   - Cefepime, day 3
   - Frequent ABG
   - Will hold off on weaning vent until patient returns from
   catheterization
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes: Patient's cardiac catheterization
   aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to significant doses of
   Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has
   been confused and agitated since his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At
   home, however, his wife states that he is not confused, but does
   exhibit short-term memory impairments. As patient has been attempting
   to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is not fully oriented despite
   repeated verbal reorientation, his primary process appears to be
   agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium. Patient also
   takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component of
   benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic work-up as an inpatient. CT
   head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar infarct of indeterminate age,
   so neurology was consulted.  Infection and CVA may be complicating
   already complex delirium and dementia picture.
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - F/U Psych recs
   - Haldol for chemical restraints once extubated
   - 4 bed rail restraint
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes as possible
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Currently, patient has a new
   stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. He was awaiting
   catheterization on [**1-24**] for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA
   occlusion. He was chest pain free without EKG changes as of [**1-24**].

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, NSTEMI, and a history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, and dementia. He was intubated due to worsening respiratory status and low-grade fever. His CT chest showed left lower lobe pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusions. He was started on Vancomycin and Cefepime empirically, and his ABG improved after initiation of antibiotics. He has a history of agitation and mental status changes, and his primary process appears to be agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium. He also has a history of EtOH withdrawal and benzodiazepine withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's CT chest showed left lower lobe pneumonia, which may worsen and lead to respiratory failure if not treated effectively.
2. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and pleural effusions may lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ dysfunction and death.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's history of EtOH abuse and benzodiazepine withdrawal may increase his risk of acute kidney injury.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's NSTEMI and history of CABG may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiogenic shock.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's history of dementia and delirium may increase his risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, and cognitive decline.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of EtOH abuse and GERD may increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding, perforation, and pancreatitis.
7. Infection: The patient's history of EtOH abuse and benzodiazepine withdrawal may increase his risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
8. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure may increase his risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to death if not treated effectively.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for pneumonia and pleural effusions.
2. Monitor for signs of sepsis and treat promptly if necessary.
3. Monitor for signs of acute kidney injury and treat promptly if necessary.
4. Monitor for signs of cardiac complications and treat promptly if necessary.
5. Monitor for signs of neurological complications and treat promptly if necessary.
6. Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal complications and treat promptly if necessary.
7. Monitor for signs of infection and treat promptly if necessary.
8. Monitor for signs of respiratory failure and treat promptly if necessary.
9. Consider consultation with neurology and psychiatry to optimize management of the patient's agitation and mental status changes.
10. Consider consultation with cardiology to optimize management of the patient's NSTEMI and cardiac status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a complex medical condition. The patient has a significant infarct in the anterior limb of the right internal capsule, which is age-indeterminate, and requires an MRI. Additionally, the patient has left lower lobe pneumonia, mild interstitial pulmonary edema, and large right and small left pleural effusions.

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, with settings adjusted to decrease respiratory rate to 16 and increase PEEP to 8. The patient is also receiving vasopressors, including norepinephrine, to maintain blood pressure. The patient has a central line and an arterial line in place.

The patient's lab results show evidence of sepsis, with elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, and troponin levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia.

The patient's current medical condition is critical, with a high risk of developing further complications. Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock is likely to lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and pulmonary edema increase the risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to further respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's vasopressor dependence and hypotension increase the risk of cardiovascular instability, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's age-indeterminate infarct in the right internal capsule increases the risk of neurological complications, including stroke, seizure, and cognitive impairment.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis and risk of gastrointestinal bleeding increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, including bleeding and perforation.
6. Infectious complications: The patient's pneumonia and sepsis increase the risk of developing further infectious complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia and catheter-related bloodstream infections.
7. Metabolic complications: The patient's electrolyte abnormalities and glucose dysregulation increase the risk of developing further metabolic complications, including hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.

In summary, the patient is critically ill with a high risk of developing further complications. Close monitoring and aggressive management of the patient's condition are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Currently, patient has a new
   stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. Patient returned to
   cath on [**1-25**] and had a PROMUS to the LIMA. His Right heart cath had a
   PCWP of 15 . On [**1-25**], patient has MAPs of roughly 50, on levophed
   implying shock.
   - central venous sat to better describe shock state
   - ASA 325mg daily, Atorvastatin 80mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily
   - Metoprolol Tartrate  37.5mg TID when bp
s tolerate
   .
   # Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: Patient
   intubated on [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and
   low-grade fever. CT chest demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and
   bilateral pleural effusions. Started on Vancomycin & Cefepime
   empirically. Urine culture from [**2182-1-23**] negative. ABG
s improving
   vis-a-vis CO2 but less so O2.
   - F/u blood cultures from [**2182-1-24**]
   - IV Vancomycin, day 4
   - Cefepime, day 4
   - Frequent ABG
   - RISBI today to assess potential for wean
   .
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. On [**1-25**], he remained
   pressor dependent.
   - titrate pressors to MAP > 60
   - lasix, fluids for even fluid balance today
   Chronic managment
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 37.5mg TID when bp
s tolerate
   - Lisinopril PO 5mg daily when tolerating PO
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes
   # CVA's, Hx of TIA
    Patient's cardiac catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was
   refractory to significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and
   [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has been confused and agitated since
   his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that
   he is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta).They
   suggest carotid dopplers. ction and CVA may be complicating already
   complex delirium and dementia picture.
   - carotids
   - f/u lipids, a1c
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - F/U Psych recs
   - Haldol for chemical restraints once extubated
   - 4 bed rail restraint
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes as possible
   .
   #. Rhythm: Patient in normal sinus rhythm. Prior report of AF was
   likely telemetry static.
   - On telemetry
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 37.5mg PO TID when bp
s tolerate
   .
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.  Home
   Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   .
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN when extubated
   - SW consult
   .
   #. HLD: Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
   .
   #. HTN:  Currently hypotensive, requiring pressors.
   -Continue Lisinopril 5mg PO daily when bp
s tolerate
   -Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 37.5mg PO TID when bp
s tolerate
   .
    #. GERD:
   - Lansoprazole 30mg daily
   .
   #. Anxiety/Depression:
   - Per psychiatry, appears to be a distant diagnosis.
   - Continue to observe

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Currently, patient has a new
   stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. Patient returned to
   cath on [**1-25**] and had a PROMUS to the LIMA. His Right heart cath had a
   PCWP of 15 . On [**1-25**], patient has MAPs of roughly 50, on levophed
   implying shock.
   - central venous sat to better describe shock state
   - ASA 325mg daily, Atorvastatin 80mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily
   - Metoprolol Tartrate  37.5mg TID when bp
s tolerate
   .
   # Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: Patient
   intubated on [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and
   low-grade fever. CT chest demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and
   bilateral pleural effusions. Started on Vancomycin & Cefepime
   empirically. Urine culture from [**2182-1-23**] negative. ABG
s improving
   vis-a-vis CO2 but less so O2.
   - F/u blood cultures from [**2182-1-24**]
   - IV Vancomycin, day 4
   - Cefepime, day 4
   - Frequent ABG
   - RISBI today to assess potential for wean
   .
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. On [**1-25**], he remained
   pressor dependent.
   - titrate pressors to MAP > 60
   - lasix, fluids for even fluid balance today
   Chronic managment
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 37.5mg TID when bp
s tolerate
   - Lisinopril PO 5mg daily when tolerating PO
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes
   # CVA's, Hx of TIA
    Patient's cardiac catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was
   refractory to significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and
   [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has been confused and agitated since
   his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that
   he is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta).They
   suggest carotid dopplers. ction and CVA may be complicating already
   complex delirium and dementia picture.

   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, and NSTEMI. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and NSTEMI. He underwent cardiac catheterization, which was aborted due to agitation. He has a new stent in the SVG-OM1 and a PROMUS to the LIMA. He is currently intubated and on pressors due to hypotension. He has a history of TIA and CVA, and recent CT head showed small bihemispheric subacute infarcts. He is also experiencing agitation and delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still unstable, and he is requiring pressors to maintain a MAP > 60. This may indicate a high risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
	* Cardiac Arrest: The patient's history of CABG and NSTEMI increases his risk of cardiac arrest, especially with the current use of pressors.
2. Neurological Complications:
	* Cerebral Edema: The patient's recent CT head showed small bihemispheric subacute infarcts, which may increase his risk of cerebral edema.
	* Seizures: The patient's history of TIA and CVA increases his risk of seizures, especially with the use of pressors.
3. Respiratory Complications:
	* Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated and on pressors, which may indicate a high risk of respiratory failure.
	* Pneumonia: The patient's CT chest showed bilateral pleural effusions, which may indicate pneumonia.
4. Metabolic Complications:
	* Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are not well-controlled, which may increase his risk of hyperglycemia.
	* Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are not well-controlled, which may increase his risk of electrolyte imbalance.
5. Infection Complications:
	* Sepsis: The patient's recent infection and use of antibiotics increase his risk of sepsis.
	* Organ Failure: The patient's underlying medical conditions and use of pressors increase his risk of organ failure.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, including his blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac enzymes.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status, including his level of consciousness, reflexes, and cranial nerves.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status, including his oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and peak airway pressure.
4. Monitor the patient's metabolic status, including his blood glucose levels, electrolyte levels, and renal function.
5. Monitor the patient's infection status, including his temperature, white blood cell count, and blood cultures.
6. Consider consulting with a cardiologist to further evaluate the patient's cardiac status and to discuss potential interventions.
7. Consider consulting with a neurologist to further evaluate the patient's neurological status and to discuss potential interventions.
8. Consider consulting with an infectious disease specialist to further evaluate the patient's infection status and to discuss potential interventions."

   CXR [**1-26**]:
   Left lower lobe atelectasis has worsened and small pleural effusions
   have
   increased. Size of the at least mildly enlarged heart is difficult to
   assess
   because of patient rotation. There is no pneumothorax. Pleural effusion
   if
   any is small, on both sides of the chest. ET tube is in standard
   placement
   and nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. Left
   jugular
   line tip projects over the SVC. No pneumothorax.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Patient returned to cath on [**1-25**]
   and had a PROMUS to the LIMA. His Right heart cath had a PCWP of 15 .
   Since intubation, patient has been on varying rates of levophed
   infusion. Levophed was being weaned on [**1-26**].
   - ASA 325mg daily, Atorvastatin 80mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily
   - will start BB when bp
s tolerate
   .
   # Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: Patient
   intubated on [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and
   low-grade fever. CT chest demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and
   bilateral pleural effusions. Started on Vancomycin & Cefepime
   empirically. Urine culture from [**2182-1-23**] negative. ABG
s improving. RSBI
   56 on the morning of [**1-27**].
   - continue IV Vancomycin, day 5,  Cefepime, day 5
   - Frequent ABG
   - attempt extubation today
   .
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was being weaned.
   - continue to wean pressor as tolerated
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - will start Metoprolol Tartrate and Lisinopril when BP can tolerate
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.

   #. Rhythm: Patient in normal sinus rhythm. Prior report of AF was
   likely telemetry static.
   - On telemetry
   - will start BB when BP can tolerate

   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.  Home
   Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   .
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN when extubated
   - SW consult
   .
   #. HLD: Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia: The patient has a history of left lower lobe pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusions, which can lead to respiratory distress and failure.
	* Pleural effusion: The patient has small pleural effusions on both sides, which can cause respiratory distress and compromise lung function.
	* Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and weaning from the ventilator may be challenging due to his respiratory distress.
2. Cardiac Complications:
	* Cardiac tamponade: The patient has a history of cardiac catheterization and may have developed cardiac tamponade, which can lead to cardiac arrest.
	* Myocardial infarction: The patient has a history of NSTEMI and may be at risk for recurrent myocardial infarction.
	* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is on multiple medications, including beta-blockers and anti-arrhythmics, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Neurological Complications:
	* Cerebral edema: The patient has a history of small lacunar infarcts and may be at risk for cerebral edema, which can lead to neurological deterioration.
	* Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures and may be at risk for recurrent seizures.
	* Delirium: The patient has a history of agitation and confusion, which can lead to delirium and increased risk of falls and other complications.

   CXR [**1-26**]:
   Left lower lobe atelectasis has worsened and small pleural effusions
   have
   increased. Size of the at least mildly enlarged heart is difficult to
   assess
   because of patient rotation. There is no pneumothorax. Pleural effusion
   if
   any is small, on both sides of the chest. ET tube is in standard
   placement
   and nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. Left
   jugular
   line tip projects over the SVC. No pneumothorax.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Patient returned to cath on [**1-25**]
   and had a PROMUS to the LIMA. His Right heart cath had a PCWP of 15 .
   Since intubation, patient has been on varying rates of levophed
   infusion. Levophed was being weaned on [**1-26**].
   - ASA 325mg daily, Atorvastatin 80mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily
   - will start BB when bp
s tolerate
   .
   # Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: Patient
   intubated on [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and
   low-grade fever. CT chest demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and
   bilateral pleural effusions. Started on Vancomycin & Cefepime
   empirically. Urine culture from [**2182-1-23**] negative. ABG
s improving. RSBI
   56 on the morning of [**1-27**].
   - continue IV Vancomycin, day 5,  Cefepime, day 5
   - Frequent ABG
   - wean off sedation
   - attempt extubation today
   - haldol prn after extubation
   .
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was being weaned.
   - continue to wean pressor as tolerated
   - give 1u pRBC today
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - will start Metoprolol Tartrate and Lisinopril when BP can tolerate
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.
   - wean off sedation
   - haldol prn
   - carotids
   - f/u hemoglobin a1c
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - F/U Psych recs
   - Haldol for chemical restraints once extubated
   - 4 bed rail restraint
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes as possible
   .
   #. Rhythm: Patient in normal sinus rhythm. Prior report of AF was
   likely telemetry static.
   - On telemetry
   - will start BB when BP can tolerate
   .
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.  Home
   Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   .
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN when extubated
   - SW consult
   .
   #. HLD: Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
   .
   #. HTN:  Currently hypotensive, requiring pressors.
   - continue to wean pressors
   - will restart Lisinopril and Metoprolol Tartrate when bp
s tolerate
   .
    #. GERD:
   - Lansoprazole 30mg daily
   .
   #. Anxiety/Depression:
   - Per psychiatry, appears to be a distant diagnosis.
   - Continue to observe

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Patient returned to cath on [**1-25**]
   and had a PROMUS to the LIMA. His Right heart cath had a PCWP of 15 .

   intubated on [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and
   low-grade fever. CT chest demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and
   bilateral pleural effusions. Started on Vancomycin & Cefepime
   empirically. Urine culture from [**2182-1-23**] negative. ABG
s improving. RSBI
   56 on the morning of [**1-27**].
   - continue IV Vancomycin, day 5,  Cefepime, day 5
   - Frequent ABG
   - wean off sedation
   - attempt extubation today
   - haldol prn after extubation
   .
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was being weaned.
   - continue to wean pressor as tolerated
   - give 1u pRBC today
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - will start Metoprolol Tartrate and Lisinopril when BP can tolerate
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.

   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN when extubated
   - SW consult

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 82-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), ethanol abuse, and a recent cardiac catheterization. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient's current medical condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and his respiratory system compliance is 56.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has a history of CABG and is currently pressor-dependent, requiring norepinephrine infusion.
* Neurological status: The patient is sedated and has a small lacunar infarct on his CT head scan, suggesting a proximal source (heart or aorta) for the infarct.
* Metabolic status: The patient has DM and is receiving insulin sliding scale and NPH insulin.
* Infectious disease status: The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and is receiving empiric antibiotics for suspected pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and he may require further mechanical ventilation or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) to manage his respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac catheterization was aborted due to agitation, and he may require further cardiac intervention or medication to manage his cardiac status.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's small lacunar infarct may progress, leading to further neurological deficits or even stroke.
4. Metabolic complications: The patient's DM may worsen, leading to hyperglycemia or ketoacidosis, and his ethanol abuse may lead to withdrawal symptoms.
5. Infectious disease complications: The patient's pneumonia may progress, leading to sepsis or septic shock, and his empiric antibiotics may not be effective against the underlying infection.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of ethanol abuse may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding or pancreatitis.
7. Renal complications: The patient's pressor dependency may lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
8. Hematological complications: The patient's pressor dependency may lead to thrombocytopenia or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

In summary, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical comorbidities, and his current condition is unstable. He requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, metabolic, and infectious disease status to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Patient returned to cath on [**1-25**]
   and had a PROMUS to the LIMA. His Right heart cath had a PCWP of 15 .
   Since intubation, patient has been on varying rates of levophed
   infusion. Levophed was being weaned off [**1-26**]. Has since been extubated.
   Pressures have been stable enough to start beta blocker.
   - ASA 325mg daily, Atorvastatin 80mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily
   - start metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: Patient
   intubated on [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and
   low-grade fever. CT chest demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and
   bilateral pleural effusions. Started on Vancomycin & Cefepime
   empirically. Urine culture from [**2182-1-23**] negative. ABG
s improving. RSBI
   56 on the morning of [**1-27**].  Pt extubated on [**2182-1-27**]. Put on BiPAP.
   Tolerating well with good oxygenation. Some CO2 retention however, pH
   relatively normal. [**Month (only) 51**] have been retaining chronically but appears
   compensated. Will continue to follow with ABGs. Afebrile, some
   coughing, no production. Lungs with bibasilar crackles.
   - continue IV Vancomycin, day 6,  Cefepime, day 6 (plan for 8 day
   course)
   - Frequent ABG
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   .
   #. Sinus Tachycardia: Unclear etiology. Had fluid challenge and pRBCs
   yesterday without improvement. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to volume status. CVP
   checked and is low at 4-7. No evidence of PE, on prophylaxis. No
   evidence of active ischemia. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to beta blocker
   withdrawal vs agitation/delirium.
   - attempt to minimize delirium as below
   - start metoprolol tartrate 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - will need NG tube for medications
   - cont tele
   .
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was weaned.  Currently stable pressures.
   - consider transfusion if evidence of hypoperfusion
 none at this time
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - start metoprolol tartrate today
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and ethanol abuse. He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) after an aborted cardiac catheterization due to agitation following an outpatient surgical hospital (OSH) admission for respiratory failure and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient has undergone several interventions, including intubation, cardiac catheterization, and stenting. He was extubated and placed on non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP) with a weaning plan in place.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 109 beats per minute, blood pressure of 123/59 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 98% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.9 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 5.5 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count: 208 x 10^9/L
* Blood urea nitrogen: 26.5 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: sodium 140 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, chloride 107 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 26.5 mmol/L

The patient's imaging studies show:

* A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest demonstrates left lower lobe atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions.
* A cardiac catheterization report shows occlusion of the saphenous vein graft (SVG) and left internal mammary artery (LIMA) grafts, but the patient's agitation during the procedure prevented completion of the catheterization.
* An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus tachycardia, and a troponin level of 0.11 ng/mL is consistent with NSTEMI.

The patient's medical history is significant for:

* CABG
* DM
* EtOH abuse
* Hx of transient ischemic attack (TIA)
* Hx of dementia
* Hx of chronic systolic heart failure (CHF)

The patient's current medications include:

* Aspirin 325mg daily
* Atorvastatin 80mg daily
* Plavix 75mg daily
* Metoprolol tartrate 25mg twice daily
* Lansoprazole 30mg daily
* Gabapentin (held)

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* NSTEMI/CAD: The patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are concerning for unstable angina, and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of NSTEMI. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG and LIMA grafts, but the patient's agitation during the procedure prevented completion of the catheterization.
* Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: The patient was intubated on [**1-23**] in the context of worsening respiratory status and low-grade fever. CT chest demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusions. The patient was extubated and placed on BiPAP.
* Sinus Tachycardia: The etiology of the patient's sinus tachycardia is unclear, but it may be secondary to volume status, beta blocker withdrawal, or agitation/delirium.
* Acute on chronic systolic CHF: The patient has persistent fluid overload and is receiving IV Lasix. His right heart cath showed a PCWP of 15, and his TTE showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis.
* Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: The patient's primary process appears to be agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium. The patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. A small lacunar infarct of indeterminate age was noted on CT head, and neurology was consulted.
* DM: The patient will continue NPH and insulin sliding scale from OSH. His home Gabapentin was held.
* EtOH abuse: The patient has a history of DTs with EtOH withdrawal, most recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. He drinks a pint of whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
* HLD: The patient will continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or cardiac arrest
* Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, or respiratory arrest
* Neurological complications, such as stroke, seizures, or increased intracranial pressure
* Metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, or electrolyte imbalances
* Infectious complications, such as sepsis, urinary tract infection, or pneumonia
* Medication-related complications, such as benzodiazepine withdrawal or beta blocker withdrawal.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Cardiac catheterization with stenting
* Intubation and mechanical ventilation
* Non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP)
* IV Lasix for fluid overload
* Insulin sliding scale for hyperglycemia
* NPH and insulin sliding scale for DM
* Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia
* Lansoprazole for GERD
* Metoprolol tartrate for hypertension
* Gabapentin (held) for anxiety
* Ativan PO PRN for anxiety
* SW consult for EtOH abuse
* F/U neurology and psychiatry recs for agitation and dementia

The patient's disposition is ICU care with close monitoring for potential complications."

   heart is difficult to assess because of patient rotation. There is no
   pneumothorax. Pleural effusion if any is small, on both sides of the
   chest. ET tube is in standard placement and nasogastric tube passes
   below the diaphragm and out of view. Left jugular line tip projects
   over the SVC. No pneumothorax.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Patient returned to cath on [**1-25**]
   and had a PROMUS to the LIMA. His Right heart cath had a PCWP of 15 .
   Since intubation, patient has been on varying rates of levophed
   infusion. Levophed was being weaned off [**1-26**]. Has since been extubated
   - ASA 325mg daily, Atorvastatin 80mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily
   - consider starting low dose beta blocker today
 will discuss with
   attending
   .
   # Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: Patient
   intubated on [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and
   low-grade fever. CT chest demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and
   bilateral pleural effusions. Started on Vancomycin & Cefepime
   empirically. Urine culture from [**2182-1-23**] negative. ABG
s improving. RSBI
   56 on the morning of [**1-27**].  Pt extubated on [**2182-1-27**]. Put on BiPAP.
   Tolerating well with good oxygenation. Some CO2 retention however, pH
   relatively normal. [**Month (only) 51**] have been retaining chronically but appears
   compensated. Will continue to follow with ABGs.
   - continue IV Vancomycin, day 6,  Cefepime, day 6
   - Frequent ABG
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   - haldol prn
   .
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was being weaned.
   - off levophed
   - consider transfusion
 no evidence of hypoperfusion
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - will start Metoprolol Tartrate and Lisinopril when BP can tolerate
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.

   .
   #. Rhythm: Patient in normal sinus rhythm/sinus tachycardia. Prior
   report of AF was likely telemetry static.
   - On telemetry
   - will start BB when BP can tolerate
   .
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.  Home
   Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   .
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN when extubated per CIWA scale
   - SW consult
   .
   #. HLD: Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
   .
    #. GERD:
   - Lansoprazole 30mg daily

   #. Anxiety/Depression:
   - Per psychiatry, appears to be a distant diagnosis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Patient returned to cath on [**1-25**]
   and had a PROMUS to the LIMA. His Right heart cath had a PCWP of 15 .
   Since intubation, patient has been on varying rates of levophed
   infusion. Levophed was being weaned off [**1-26**]. Has since been extubated
   - ASA 325mg daily, Atorvastatin 80mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily
   - consider starting low dose beta blocker today
 will discuss with
   attending
   .
   # Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: Patient
   intubated on [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and
   low-grade fever. CT chest demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and
   bilateral pleural effusions. Started on Vancomycin & Cefepime
   empirically. Urine culture from [**2182-1-23**] negative. ABG
s improving. RSBI
   56 on the morning of [**1-27**].  Pt extubated on [**2182-1-27**]. Put on BiPAP.
   Tolerating well with good oxygenation. Some CO2 retention however, pH
   relatively normal. [**Month (only) 51**] have been retaining chronically but appears
   compensated. Will continue to follow with ABGs.
   - continue IV Vancomycin, day 6,  Cefepime, day 6
   - Frequent ABG
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   - haldol prn
   .
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was being weaned.
   - off levophed
   - consider transfusion
 no evidence of hypoperfusion
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - will start Metoprolol Tartrate and Lisinopril when BP can tolerate
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.

   - 4 bed rail restraint
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes as possible
   .
   #. Rhythm: Patient in normal sinus rhythm/sinus tachycardia. Prior
   report of AF was likely telemetry static.
   - On telemetry
   - will start BB when BP can tolerate
   .
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.  Home
   Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   .
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN when extubated per CIWA scale
   - SW consult
   .
   #. HLD: Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
   .
    #. GERD:
   - Lansoprazole 30mg daily

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, and he is still requiring oxygen therapy. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise, particularly with the presence of left lower lobe atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of CABG, NSTEMI, and cardiac catheterization. He is still pressor-dependent and has a PCWP of 15. There is a risk of further cardiac decompensation, particularly with the presence of systolic CHF.
3. Metabolic Disturbances: The patient has a history of DM and is currently on insulin sliding scale. There is a risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, particularly with the presence of respiratory failure and cardiac compromise.
4. Infection: The patient has been empirically treated with antibiotics for a possible pneumonia, and there is a risk of further infection, particularly with the presence of pleural effusions.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient has a history of CVA and TIA, and there is a risk of further neurological compromise, particularly with the presence of agitation and delirium.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient has a history of fluid overload and is currently on diuretics. There is a risk of further fluid overload, particularly with the presence of CHF and respiratory failure.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a history of GERD and is currently on proton pump inhibitors. There is a risk of further gastrointestinal complications, particularly with the presence of respiratory failure and cardiac compromise.
8. Anxiety and Depression: The patient has a history of anxiety and depression, and there is a risk of further psychological complications, particularly with the presence of agitation and delirium.

In terms of the patient's current status, he is extubated and on BiPAP, but still requiring oxygen therapy. His cardiac status is still compromised, and he is still pressor-dependent. His respiratory status is improving, but there is still a risk of further respiratory compromise. His metabolic status is stable, but there is still a risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. His neurological status is still compromised, and there is still a risk of further neurological compromise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient, an 82-year-old male, was admitted to the ICU with a history of CABG, DM, and EtOH abuse. He was intubated for respiratory distress and underwent cardiac catheterization, which was aborted due to agitation. He was extubated and placed on BiPAP, which was weaned this morning. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, and blood pressure of 123/59 mmHg. His respiratory support includes high-flow neb and CPAP/PSV.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and he may require further respiratory support. The worsening of left lower lobe atelectasis and small pleural effusions on CXR is a concern.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CABG and NSTEMI, and his cardiac status is still unstable. He may be at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or recurrent MI.
3. Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and may be at risk for further infections, particularly with his indwelling urinary catheter.
4. Diabetes: The patient has type II diabetes, and his glucose levels are not well-controlled. He may be at risk for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
5. Neurological complications: The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to his underlying medical conditions or medication effects. He may be at risk for further neurological deterioration.
6. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids, which may lead to fluid overload and exacerbate his respiratory and cardiac status.
7. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to his immobility and underlying medical conditions. Prophylactic measures, such as SQ UF Heparin, should be continued.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust his respiratory support as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust his medications as needed to prevent cardiac complications.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust his insulin regimen as needed to prevent hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status closely and adjust his medications as needed to prevent further neurological deterioration.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's fluid status closely and adjust his fluid intake as needed to prevent fluid overload.
6. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of DVT and adjust his prophylactic measures as needed."

   Final Report
   INDICATION: 82-year-old man with NSTEMI, respiratory failure and status
   post
   placement of NG tube. Evaluate for position of NG tube.
   COMPARISON: Multiple priors, most recent portable AP chest radiograph
   [**2182-1-28**].
   TECHNIQUE: Portable AP chest radiograph.
   FINDINGS: Comparison is made to portable AP chest radiograph obtained
   earlier
   today. Gastric tube is noted to extend beyond the level of the
   diaphragm with
   tip coiled within the stomach. Otherwise, no interval change noted from
   most
   recent portable AP chest radiograph obtained earlier today.
   ECG: 12:30am - Normal sinus rhythm, no ST changes.  No evidence of RV
   strain.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Patient returned to cath on [**1-25**]
   and had a PROMUS to the LIMA. His Right heart cath had a PCWP of 15 .
   Since intubation, patient has been on varying rates of levophed
   infusion. Levophed was being weaned off [**1-26**]. Has since been extubated.
   Pressures have been stable enough to start beta blocker.
   - ASA 325mg daily, Atorvastatin 80mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily
   - start metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: Patient
   intubated on [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and
   low-grade fever. CT chest demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and
   bilateral pleural effusions. Started on Vancomycin & Cefepime
   empirically. Urine culture from [**2182-1-23**] negative. ABG
s improving. RSBI
   56 on the morning of [**1-27**].  Pt extubated on [**2182-1-27**]. Put on BiPAP.
   Tolerating well with good oxygenation. Some CO2 retention however, pH
   relatively normal. [**Month (only) 51**] have been retaining chronically but appears
   compensated. Will continue to follow with ABGs. Afebrile, some
   coughing, no production. Lungs with bibasilar crackles.
   - continue IV Vancomycin, day 6,  Cefepime, day 6 (plan for 8 day
   course)
   - Frequent ABG
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   .
   #. Sinus Tachycardia: Unclear etiology. Had fluid challenge and pRBCs
   yesterday without improvement. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to volume status. CVP
   checked and is low at 4-7. No evidence of PE, on prophylaxis. No
   evidence of active ischemia. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to beta blocker
   withdrawal vs agitation/delirium.
   - attempt to minimize delirium as below
   - start metoprolol tartrate 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - will need NG tube for medications
   - cont tele
   .
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was weaned.  Currently stable pressures.
   - consider transfusion if evidence of hypoperfusion
 none at this time
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - start metoprolol tartrate today
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Final Report
   INDICATION: 82-year-old man with NSTEMI, respiratory failure and status
   post
   placement of NG tube. Evaluate for position of NG tube.
   COMPARISON: Multiple priors, most recent portable AP chest radiograph
   [**2182-1-28**].
   TECHNIQUE: Portable AP chest radiograph.
   FINDINGS: Comparison is made to portable AP chest radiograph obtained
   earlier
   today. Gastric tube is noted to extend beyond the level of the
   diaphragm with
   tip coiled within the stomach. Otherwise, no interval change noted from
   most
   recent portable AP chest radiograph obtained earlier today.
   ECG: 12:30am - Normal sinus rhythm, no ST changes.  No evidence of RV
   strain.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, transferred to CCU
   after aborted cardiac catheterization caused by agitation following an
   OSH ICU admission for respiratory failure & NSTEMI.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Patient returned to cath on [**1-25**]
   and had a PROMUS to the LIMA. His Right heart cath had a PCWP of 15 .
   Since intubation, patient has been on varying rates of levophed
   infusion. Levophed was being weaned off [**1-26**]. Has since been extubated.
   Pressures have been stable enough to start beta blocker.
   - ASA 325mg daily, Atorvastatin 80mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily
   - start metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # Respiratory Distress with Complex Metabolic Disturbance: Patient
   intubated on [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and
   low-grade fever. CT chest demonstrated left lower lobe pneumonia and
   bilateral pleural effusions. Started on Vancomycin & Cefepime
   empirically. Urine culture from [**2182-1-23**] negative. ABG
s improving. RSBI
   56 on the morning of [**1-27**].  Pt extubated on [**2182-1-27**]. Put on BiPAP.
   Tolerating well with good oxygenation. Some CO2 retention however, pH
   relatively normal. [**Month (only) 51**] have been retaining chronically but appears
   compensated. Will continue to follow with ABGs. Afebrile, some
   coughing, no production. Lungs with bibasilar crackles.
   - continue IV Vancomycin, day 6,  Cefepime, day 6 (plan for 8 day
   course)
   - Frequent ABG
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   .
   #. Sinus Tachycardia: Unclear etiology. Had fluid challenge and pRBCs
   yesterday without improvement. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to volume status. CVP
   checked and is low at 4-7. No evidence of PE, on prophylaxis. No
   evidence of active ischemia. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to beta blocker
   withdrawal vs agitation/delirium.
   - attempt to minimize delirium as below
   - start metoprolol tartrate 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - will need NG tube for medications
   - cont tele
   .
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was weaned.  Currently stable pressures.
   - consider transfusion if evidence of hypoperfusion
 none at this time
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - start metoprolol tartrate today
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old man admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of NSTEMI, respiratory failure, and placement of an NG tube. He has a history of type II diabetes, urinary tract infection, respiratory failure, altered mental status, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.3°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 133/59 mmHg. He is receiving tube feeds, metoprolol, senna/colace, and heparin sodium. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, and troponin-T levels. Imaging studies reveal no interval change in the position of the NG tube.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's NG tube may be dislodged, causing aspiration or bleeding. Tube feeds may not be adequately tolerated, leading to malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, requiring mechanical ventilation. Pneumonia or other respiratory infections may develop, further compromising lung function.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's NSTEMI may progress to cardiogenic shock, requiring vasopressors and inotropes. Myocardial rupture or ventricular arrhythmias may occur, further compromising cardiac function.
4. Infection: The patient's urinary tract infection may spread to the bloodstream, causing sepsis or septic shock. Pneumonia or other infections may develop, further compromising the patient's condition.
5. Metabolic complications: The patient's diabetes may worsen, leading to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. Electrolyte imbalances may develop, requiring aggressive management.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may worsen, requiring close monitoring and potential treatment with sedatives or anticonvulsants. Seizures or other neurological events may occur, further compromising the patient's condition.
7. Hematological complications: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process. Bleeding or thrombocytopenia may occur, requiring close monitoring and potential treatment with platelet transfusions or anticoagulants."

   borderline LAD, poor R wave progression, Q waves III, V1, no ST
   deviation, T weave inversion I, aVL, flattened Ts V1, V5, V6
   Assessment and Plan
   82M with history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with NSTEMI
   c/b respiratory failure requiring intubation, pna on abx, agitation and
   sinus tachycardia, now s/p PROMUS to LIMA.
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient presented to an outside hospital with angina
   and troponin elevation. No EKG from OSH. Likely NSTEMI given EKG at
   [**Hospital1 19**]. Serum troponin at admission of 0.04. The patient underwent
   cardiac catheterization which demonstrated occlusion of SVG-OM1 and
   LIMA-LAD grafts. The patient was very agitated during the procedure and
   the procedure was aborted. The patient returned to that cath lab and
   had a PROMUS placed in his LIMA. The patient is currently chest pain
   free and has been off NTG drip.
   - Aspirin 325mg daily
   - Clopidogrel 75mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Uptitrate metoprolol tartrate (currently at 37.5 [**Hospital1 7**]) to 50mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Consider adding low dose ACE inhibitor if pressures tolerate
   #. Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology. The patient was intubated on
   [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and low grade fever.
   The patient had a CT of the chest which demonstrated LLL pneumonia with
   bilateral pleural effusions. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime
   with a plan for an 8 day course. The patient was extubated on [**2182-1-27**].
   Put on BiPAP and tolerated with well. Was weaned to 50% FM and is
   currently oxygenating well. Patient is hypercarbic but with stable pH
   which means it may be chronic. Currently ABG appear stable but patient
   requiring large amounts of supplemental O2. Will continue to evaluated.
   CVP measured yesterday which was ~7 (although in context of single
   measurement is relatively meaningless).
   - continue IV vancomycin day 7, cefepime day 7 (plan for 8 day course)
   - continue frequent ABGs
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   - CXR - ?new consolidation, fluid status
   #. Sinus tachycardia: Unclear etiology. The patient had fluid challenge
   and pRBCs without clear any change in heart rate or blood pressure.
   Differential includes hypotension, PE, beta blocker withdrawal,
   hypoxia, fever, anxiety/agitation, hyperthyroidism, ischemia/MI, heart
   failure, chronic pulmonary disease. The patinet has a relatively low
   CVP but also did not respond to fluid challenges. Patient was
   anticoagulated and thus shouldn't have PE. ABG show patient isn't
   hypoxemic. No current fever. No history of hyperthyroidism or ongoing
   ischemia or MI. No history of pulmonary disease. Front runners include
   beta blocker withdrawal, anxiety/agitation and heart failure. Recent
   echo with maintained systolic function. Restarting beta blocker today.
   Will do best to control delirium and agitation with normal precautions.
   - minimize delirium
   - uptitrate metoprolol
   - continue tele
   - consider fluid challenge if continues
   - consider eval for PE
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was weaned.  Currently stable pressures.
   - consider transfusion or IVF bolus if evidence of hypoperfusion
 none
   at this time
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - start metoprolol tartrate today
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.
   - consider carotid u/s per neuro recs
   - f/u hemoglobin A1C
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - F/U Psych recs
   - 4 bed rail restraint, 2 ext restraints
 pulling at lines
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes as possible
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.  Home
   Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Now is outside
   window for EtOH withdrawal. Will need monitoring for benzo withdrawal.
   - SW consult  when mental status improves
   .
   #. HLD:
   - Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
    #. GERD:
   - Lansoprazole 30mg daily
   .
   #. Anxiety/Depression:
   - Per psychiatry, appears to be a distant diagnosis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his

   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of

   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of CABG, DM, and EtOH abuse, who presented to the hospital with NSTEMI and was subsequently intubated for respiratory failure. He underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have occlusion of SVG-OM1 and LIMA-LAD grafts. He was given a PROMUS placed in his LIMA. He is currently chest pain-free and has been off NTG drip. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia, sinus tachycardia, and acute on chronic systolic CHF.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and he requires large amounts of supplemental oxygen. He has a history of pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is at risk for developing sepsis.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CABG and has undergone cardiac catheterization. He has been diagnosed with NSTEMI and has a high risk of developing cardiac complications.
4. Delirium: The patient has a history of agitation and confusion, and has been diagnosed with delirium.
5. CVA: The patient has a small lacunar infarct of indeterminate age, and has been diagnosed with small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular territories.
6. Benzodiazepine withdrawal: The patient has a history of taking Ativan at home, and may be experiencing benzodiazepine withdrawal.
7. Fluid overload: The patient has a history of fluid overload and has been diagnosed with acute on chronic systolic CHF.
8. DVT: The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to his immobility and history of cardiac catheterization.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's delirium and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
4. Consider ordering a carotid ultrasound to further evaluate the patient's CVA.
5. Consider ordering a CT scan of the head to further evaluate the patient's CVA.
6. Consider ordering a stress test to further evaluate the patient's cardiac status.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's fluid status and adjust his fluid therapy as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust his insulin regimen as needed.
9. Consider ordering a DVT prophylaxis medication to reduce the patient's risk of developing DVT."

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with NSTEMI
   c/b respiratory failure requiring intubation, pna on abx, agitation and
   sinus tachycardia, now s/p PROMUS to LIMA.
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient presented to an outside hospital with angina
   and troponin elevation. No EKG from OSH. Likely NSTEMI given EKG at
   [**Hospital1 19**]. Serum troponin at admission of 0.04. The patient underwent
   cardiac catheterization which demonstrated occlusion of SVG-OM1 and
   LIMA-LAD grafts. The patient was very agitated during the procedure and
   the procedure was aborted. The patient returned to that cath lab and
   had a PROMUS placed in his LIMA. The patient is currently chest pain
   free and has been off NTG drip.
   - Aspirin 325mg daily
   - Clopidogrel 75mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Uptitrate metoprolol tartrate (currently at 37.5 [**Hospital1 7**]) to 50mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Consider adding low dose ACE inhibitor if pressures tolerate
   #. Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology. The patient was intubated on
   [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and low grade fever.
   The patient had a CT of the chest which demonstrated LLL pneumonia with
   bilateral pleural effusions. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime
   with a plan for an 8 day course. The patient was extubated on [**2182-1-27**].
   Put on BiPAP and tolerated with well. Was weaned to 50% FM and is
   currently oxygenating well. Patient is hypercarbic but with stable pH
   which means it may be chronic. Currently ABG appear stable but patient
   requiring large amounts of supplemental O2. Will continue to evaluated.
   CVP measured yesterday which was ~7 (although in context of single
   measurement is relatively meaningless).
   - continue IV vancomycin day 7, cefepime day 7 (plan for 8 day course)
   - continue frequent ABGs
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   - CXR - ?new consolidation, fluid status
   #. Sinus tachycardia: Unclear etiology. The patient had fluid challenge
   and pRBCs without clear any change in heart rate or blood pressure.
   Differential includes hypotension, PE, beta blocker withdrawal,
   hypoxia, fever, anxiety/agitation, hyperthyroidism, ischemia/MI, heart
   failure, chronic pulmonary disease. The patinet has a relatively low
   CVP but also did not respond to fluid challenges. Patient was
   anticoagulated and thus shouldn't have PE. ABG show patient isn't
   hypoxemic. No current fever. No history of hyperthyroidism or ongoing
   ischemia or MI. No history of pulmonary disease. Front runners include
   beta blocker withdrawal, anxiety/agitation and heart failure. Recent
   echo with maintained systolic function. Restarting beta blocker today.
   Will do best to control delirium and agitation with normal precautions.
   - minimize delirium

   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was weaned.  Currently stable pressures.

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with NSTEMI
   c/b respiratory failure requiring intubation, pna on abx, agitation and
   sinus tachycardia, now s/p PROMUS to LIMA.
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient presented to an outside hospital with angina
   and troponin elevation. No EKG from OSH. Likely NSTEMI given EKG at
   [**Hospital1 19**]. Serum troponin at admission of 0.04. The patient underwent
   cardiac catheterization which demonstrated occlusion of SVG-OM1 and
   LIMA-LAD grafts. The patient was very agitated during the procedure and
   the procedure was aborted. The patient returned to that cath lab and
   had a PROMUS placed in his LIMA. The patient is currently chest pain
   free and has been off NTG drip.
   - Aspirin 325mg daily
   - Clopidogrel 75mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Uptitrate metoprolol tartrate (currently at 37.5 [**Hospital1 7**]) to 50mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Consider adding low dose ACE inhibitor if pressures tolerate
   #. Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology. The patient was intubated on
   [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and low grade fever.
   The patient had a CT of the chest which demonstrated LLL pneumonia with
   bilateral pleural effusions. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime
   with a plan for an 8 day course. The patient was extubated on [**2182-1-27**].
   Put on BiPAP and tolerated with well. Was weaned to 50% FM and is
   currently oxygenating well. Patient is hypercarbic but with stable pH
   which means it may be chronic. Currently ABG appear stable but patient
   requiring large amounts of supplemental O2. Will continue to evaluated.
   CVP measured yesterday which was ~7 (although in context of single
   measurement is relatively meaningless).
   - continue IV vancomycin day 7, cefepime day 7 (plan for 8 day course)
   - continue frequent ABGs
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   - CXR - ?new consolidation, fluid status
   #. Sinus tachycardia: Unclear etiology. The patient had fluid challenge
   and pRBCs without clear any change in heart rate or blood pressure.
   Differential includes hypotension, PE, beta blocker withdrawal,
   hypoxia, fever, anxiety/agitation, hyperthyroidism, ischemia/MI, heart
   failure, chronic pulmonary disease. The patinet has a relatively low
   CVP but also did not respond to fluid challenges. Patient was
   anticoagulated and thus shouldn't have PE. ABG show patient isn't
   hypoxemic. No current fever. No history of hyperthyroidism or ongoing
   ischemia or MI. No history of pulmonary disease. Front runners include
   beta blocker withdrawal, anxiety/agitation and heart failure. Recent
   echo with maintained systolic function. Restarting beta blocker today.
   Will do best to control delirium and agitation with normal precautions.
   - minimize delirium
   - uptitrate metoprolol
   - continue tele
   - consider fluid challenge if continues
   - consider eval for PE
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was weaned.  Currently stable pressures.
   - consider transfusion or IVF bolus if evidence of hypoperfusion
 none
   at this time
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - start metoprolol tartrate today
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.
   - consider carotid u/s per neuro recs
   - f/u hemoglobin A1C
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - F/U Psych recs
   - 4 bed rail restraint, 2 ext restraints
 pulling at lines
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes as possible
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.  Home
   Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Now is outside
   window for EtOH withdrawal. Will need monitoring for benzo withdrawal.
   - SW consult  when mental status improves
   .
   #. HLD:
   - Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
    #. GERD:
   - Lansoprazole 30mg daily
   .
   #. Anxiety/Depression:
   - Per psychiatry, appears to be a distant diagnosis.
   - Continue to observe

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and ethanol abuse. He presented to the hospital with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was found to have occlusion of the saphenous vein graft (SVG) and left internal mammary artery (LIMA) grafts. He underwent cardiac catheterization and had a PROMUS stent placed in his LIMA.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to worsening respiratory status and low-grade fever. He has LLL pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions, and is currently on vancomycin and cefepime.
2. Sinus tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is 94 beats per minute, and his blood pressure is 140/66 mmHg. He has a relatively low central venous pressure (CVP) and did not respond to fluid challenges.
3. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient has persistent fluid overload and is on IV Lasix. His right heart catheterization showed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 15 mmHg.
4. Agitation and mental status changes: The patient is agitated and confused, and has a history of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and small lacunar infarcts on his brain MRI.
5. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has uncontrolled DM and is on insulin sliding scale and NPH.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate further, leading to increased oxygen requirements, respiratory acidosis, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's sinus tachycardia and systolic heart failure can worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's agitation and mental status changes can worsen, leading to increased risk of falls, pressure ulcers, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Infection: The patient's pneumonia can worsen, leading to sepsis, septic shock, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy can increase his risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and potentially life-threatening complications.

To mitigate these risks, the patient requires close monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare providers. This includes:

1. Respiratory support: The patient requires ongoing respiratory support, including oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation as needed.
2. Cardiac management: The patient requires close monitoring of his cardiac status, including his heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac enzymes.
3. Neurological management: The patient requires close monitoring of his neurological status, including his mental status, agitation, and risk of falls.
4. Infection control: The patient requires ongoing infection control measures, including antibiotic therapy and wound care.
5. Bleeding prevention: The patient requires ongoing bleeding prevention measures, including anticoagulation therapy and bleeding prophylaxis.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare providers to mitigate the risks associated with his current condition and to improve his outcomes."

   deviation, T weave inversion I, aVL, flattened Ts V1, V5, V6
   Assessment and Plan
   82M with history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with NSTEMI
   c/b respiratory failure requiring intubation, pna on abx, agitation and
   sinus tachycardia, now s/p PROMUS to LIMA.
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient presented to an outside hospital with angina
   and troponin elevation. No EKG from OSH. Likely NSTEMI given EKG at
   [**Hospital1 19**]. Serum troponin at admission of 0.04. The patient underwent
   cardiac catheterization which demonstrated occlusion of SVG-OM1 and
   LIMA-LAD grafts. The patient was very agitated during the procedure and
   the procedure was aborted. The patient returned to that cath lab and
   had a PROMUS placed in his LIMA. The patient is currently chest pain
   free and has been off NTG drip.
   - Aspirin 325mg daily
   - Clopidogrel 75mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Uptitrate metoprolol tartrate (currently at 37.5 [**Hospital1 7**])
   - Consider adding low dose ACE inhibitor if pressures tolerate
   #. Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology. The patient was intubated on
   [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and low grade fever.
   The patient had a CT of the chest which demonstrated LLL pneumonia with
   bilateral pleural effusions. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime
   with a plan for an 8 day course. The patient was extubated on [**2182-1-27**].
   Put on BiPAP and tolerated with well. Was weaned to 50% FM and is
   currently oxygenating well. Patient is hypercarbic but with stable pH
   which means it may be chronic. Currently ABG appear stable but patient
   requiring large amounts of supplemental O2. Will continue to evaluated.
   CVP measured yesterday which was ~7 (although in context of single
   measurement is relatively meaningless).
   - continue IV vancomycin day 7, cefepime day 7 (plan for 8 day course)
   - continue frequent ABGs
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   - consider further diuresis if
   #. Sinus tachycardia: Unclear etiology. The patient had fluid challenge
   and pRBCs without clear any change in heart rate or blood pressure.
   Differential includes hypotension, PE, beta blocker withdrawal,
   hypoxia, fever, anxiety/agitation, hyperthyroidism, ischemia/MI, heart
   failure, chronic pulmonary disease. The patinet has a relatively low
   CVP but also did not respond to fluid challenges. Patient was
   anticoagulated and thus shouldn't have PE. ABG show patient isn't
   hypoxemic. No current fever. No history of hyperthyroidism or ongoing
   ischemia or MI. No history of pulmonary disease. Front runners include
   beta blocker withdrawal, anxiety/agitation and heart failure. Recent
   echo with maintained systolic function. Restarting beta blocker today.
   Will do best to control delirium and agitation with normal precautions.
   - minimize delirium
   - uptitrate metoprolol 37.5mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - continue tele
   - consider fluid challenge
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was weaned.  Currently stable pressures.
   - consider transfusion if evidence of hypoperfusion
 none at this time
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - start metoprolol tartrate today
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.

   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.  Home
   Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Now is outside
   window for EtOH withdrawal. Will need monitoring for benzo withdrawal.
   - SW consult  when mental status improves

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   levophed was weaned.  Currently stable pressures.

   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.

   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Now is outside

Based on the provided progress note, I have summarized the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of CABG, DM, and EtOH abuse, who presented to the hospital with NSTEMI and was intubated due to respiratory failure.
* He has undergone cardiac catheterization and had a PROMUS stent placed in his LIMA.
* He is currently receiving IV antibiotics and has a diagnosis of LLL pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions.
* He has a history of CHF with an EF of 51% and has been receiving IV Lasix.
* He has been experiencing agitation, delirium, and dementia, which may be related to CVA or benzodiazepine withdrawal.
* He has a history of EtOH abuse and is at risk for benzodiazepine withdrawal.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and he requires large amounts of supplemental oxygen. He has a history of LLL pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusions, which may lead to further respiratory compromise.
2. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient has a history of CHF and has undergone cardiac catheterization. He is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
3. **Neurological Complications:** The patient has a history of CVA and dementia, which may lead to further neurological decline.
4. **Infection:** The patient has a diagnosis of LLL pneumonia and is receiving IV antibiotics. He is at risk for further infections, such as sepsis or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient has a history of GERD and is receiving lansoprazole. He is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
6. **Bloodstream Infections:** The patient has an arterial line and multiple lumen lines, which increases his risk for bloodstream infections.
7. **Benzodiazepine Withdrawal:** The patient has a history of EtOH abuse and has been taking Ativan at home. He is at risk for benzodiazepine withdrawal, which can lead to seizures, anxiety, and other complications.
8. **Dementia and Delirium:** The patient has a history of dementia and delirium, which may worsen with further medical complications.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue IV antibiotics for LLL pneumonia.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust oxygen therapy as needed.
3. Continue cardiac medications, including metoprolol and atorvastatin.
4. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and consider further evaluation for CVA or dementia.
5. Consider further diuresis to manage fluid overload.
6. Monitor the patient's glucose control closely and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
7. Consider consultation with neurology and psychiatry to further evaluate the patient's cognitive and emotional status.
8. Monitor the patient's lines and tubes closely to prevent infection and ensure proper function."

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with NSTEMI
   c/b respiratory failure requiring intubation, pna on abx, agitation and
   sinus tachycardia, now s/p PROMUS to LIMA.
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient presented to an outside hospital with angina
   and troponin elevation. No EKG from OSH. Likely NSTEMI given EKG at
   [**Hospital1 19**]. Serum troponin at admission of 0.04. The patient underwent
   cardiac catheterization which demonstrated occlusion of SVG-OM1 and
   LIMA-LAD grafts. The patient was very agitated during the procedure and
   the procedure was aborted. The patient returned to that cath lab and
   had a PROMUS placed in his LIMA. The patient is currently chest pain
   free and has been off NTG drip.
   - Aspirin 325mg daily
   - Clopidogrel 75mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Uptitrate metoprolol tartrate (currently at 37.5 [**Hospital1 7**])
   - Consider adding low dose ACE inhibitor if pressures tolerate
   #. Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology. The patient was intubated on
   [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and low grade fever.
   The patient had a CT of the chest which demonstrated LLL pneumonia with
   bilateral pleural effusions. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime
   with a plan for an 8 day course. The patient was extubated on [**2182-1-27**].
   Put on BiPAP and tolerated with well. Was weaned to 50% FM and is
   currently oxygenating well. Patient is hypercarbic but with stable pH
   which means it may be chronic. Currently ABG appear stable but patient
   requiring large amounts of supplemental O2. Will continue to evaluated.
   CVP measured yesterday which was ~7 (although in context of single
   measurement is relatively meaningless).
   - continue IV vancomycin day 7, cefepime day 7 (plan for 8 day course)
   - continue frequent ABGs
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   - consider further diuresis if
   #. Sinus tachycardia: Unclear etiology. The patient had fluid challenge
   and pRBCs without clear any change in heart rate or blood pressure.
   Differential includes hypotension, PE, beta blocker withdrawal,
   hypoxia, fever, anxiety/agitation, hyperthyroidism, ischemia/MI, heart
   failure, chronic pulmonary disease. The patinet has a relatively low
   CVP but also did not respond to fluid challenges. Patient was
   anticoagulated and thus shouldn't have PE. ABG show patient isn't
   hypoxemic. No current fever. No history of hyperthyroidism or ongoing
   ischemia or MI. No history of pulmonary disease. Front runners include
   beta blocker withdrawal, anxiety/agitation and heart failure. Recent
   echo with maintained systolic function. Restarting beta blocker today.
   Will do best to control delirium and agitation with normal precautions.
   - minimize delirium
   - uptitrate metoprolol 37.5mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - continue tele
   - consider fluid challenge

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with NSTEMI
   c/b respiratory failure requiring intubation, pna on abx, agitation and
   sinus tachycardia, now s/p PROMUS to LIMA.
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient presented to an outside hospital with angina
   and troponin elevation. No EKG from OSH. Likely NSTEMI given EKG at
   [**Hospital1 19**]. Serum troponin at admission of 0.04. The patient underwent
   cardiac catheterization which demonstrated occlusion of SVG-OM1 and
   LIMA-LAD grafts. The patient was very agitated during the procedure and
   the procedure was aborted. The patient returned to that cath lab and
   had a PROMUS placed in his LIMA. The patient is currently chest pain
   free and has been off NTG drip.
   - Aspirin 325mg daily
   - Clopidogrel 75mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Uptitrate metoprolol tartrate (currently at 37.5 [**Hospital1 7**])
   - Consider adding low dose ACE inhibitor if pressures tolerate
   #. Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology. The patient was intubated on
   [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and low grade fever.
   The patient had a CT of the chest which demonstrated LLL pneumonia with
   bilateral pleural effusions. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime
   with a plan for an 8 day course. The patient was extubated on [**2182-1-27**].
   Put on BiPAP and tolerated with well. Was weaned to 50% FM and is
   currently oxygenating well. Patient is hypercarbic but with stable pH
   which means it may be chronic. Currently ABG appear stable but patient
   requiring large amounts of supplemental O2. Will continue to evaluated.
   CVP measured yesterday which was ~7 (although in context of single
   measurement is relatively meaningless).
   - continue IV vancomycin day 7, cefepime day 7 (plan for 8 day course)
   - continue frequent ABGs
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   - consider further diuresis if
   #. Sinus tachycardia: Unclear etiology. The patient had fluid challenge
   and pRBCs without clear any change in heart rate or blood pressure.
   Differential includes hypotension, PE, beta blocker withdrawal,
   hypoxia, fever, anxiety/agitation, hyperthyroidism, ischemia/MI, heart
   failure, chronic pulmonary disease. The patinet has a relatively low
   CVP but also did not respond to fluid challenges. Patient was
   anticoagulated and thus shouldn't have PE. ABG show patient isn't
   hypoxemic. No current fever. No history of hyperthyroidism or ongoing
   ischemia or MI. No history of pulmonary disease. Front runners include
   beta blocker withdrawal, anxiety/agitation and heart failure. Recent
   echo with maintained systolic function. Restarting beta blocker today.
   Will do best to control delirium and agitation with normal precautions.
   - minimize delirium
   - uptitrate metoprolol 37.5mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - continue tele
   - consider fluid challenge

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of CABG, DM, and EtOH abuse, who presented to the hospital with NSTEMI and respiratory failure. He underwent cardiac catheterization, which demonstrated occlusion of SVG-OM1 and LIMA-LAD grafts, and was subsequently placed with a PROMUS in his LIMA.

The patient's current condition is stable, with no chest pain and off NTG drip. He is being treated with aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, and metoprolol tartrate, with plans to uptitrate the metoprolol.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with ABG results showing pH 7.42, PaO2/FiO2 142, and SpO2 97%. He is currently on BiPAP and is tolerating it well, with plans to wean off O2 as tolerated.

The patient's sinus tachycardia is unclear in etiology, but possible causes include beta blocker withdrawal, anxiety/agitation, and heart failure. He is being restarted on beta blocker and will have further evaluation to control delirium and agitation.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 6.0-6.6 K/uL
* Hct: 26.5-30.2%
* Plt: 248-254 K/uL
* Cr: 0.9-1.0 mg/dL
* TCO2: 29-33 mmHg
* Glucose: 146-208 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR 15.3/35.6/1.3, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T 38/3/0.11, Lactic Acid 0.7 mmol/L, Ca++ 8.1 mg/dL, Mg++ 1.8 mg/dL, PO4 2.4 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CXR: Gastric tube extending beyond the level of the diaphragm with tip coiled within the stomach, with no interval change noted from most recent portable AP chest radiograph obtained earlier today.
* ECG: Sinus tachycardia at 94, QTc 441, borderline LAD, poor R wave progression, Q waves III, V1, no ST deviation, T wave inversion I, aVL, flattened T waves V1, V5, V6.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he requires large amounts of supplemental O2 and is hypercarbic.
* Sinus tachycardia: The patient's sinus tachycardia is unclear in etiology, but possible causes include beta blocker withdrawal, anxiety/agitation, and heart failure.
* Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is currently on antibiotics, but further evaluation is needed to rule out any potential infections.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of CABG and NSTEMI, and is currently on medications to prevent further cardiovascular complications.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a gastric tube in place, and may be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding or other complications.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but further evaluation and management are needed to prevent potential medical complications."

   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.

   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Now is outside

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with NSTEMI
   c/b respiratory failure requiring intubation, pna on abx, agitation and
   sinus tachycardia, now s/p PROMUS to LIMA.
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient presented to an outside hospital with angina
   and troponin elevation. No EKG from OSH. Likely NSTEMI given EKG at
   [**Hospital1 19**]. Serum troponin at admission of 0.04. The patient underwent
   cardiac catheterization which demonstrated occlusion of SVG-OM1 and
   LIMA-LAD grafts. The patient was very agitated during the procedure and
   the procedure was aborted. The patient returned to that cath lab and
   had a PROMUS placed in his LIMA. The patient is currently chest pain
   free and has been off NTG drip.
   - Aspirin 325mg daily
   - Clopidogrel 75mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 37.5mg TID
   - Consider adding low dose ACE inhibitor if pressures tolerate
   #. Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology. The patient was intubated on
   [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and low grade fever.
   The patient had a CT of the chest which demonstrated LLL pneumonia with
   bilateral pleural effusions. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime
   with a plan for an 8 day course. The patient was extubated on [**2182-1-27**].
   Put on BiPAP and tolerated with well. Was weaned to 50% FM and is
   currently oxygenating well. Patient is hypercarbic but with stable pH
   which means it may be chronic. Currently ABG appear stable but patient
   requiring large amounts of supplemental O2. Will continue to evaluated.
   CVP measured yesterday which was ~7 (although in context of single
   measurement is relatively meaningless).
   - continue IV vancomycin day 8, cefepime day 8 (plan for 8 day course)
   - d/c antibiotics after todays dose
   - continue frequent ABGs
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   #. Sinus tachycardia: Unclear etiology. The patient had fluid challenge
   and pRBCs without clear any change in heart rate or blood pressure.
   Differential includes hypotension, PE, beta blocker withdrawal,
   hypoxia, fever, anxiety/agitation, hyperthyroidism, ischemia/MI, heart
   failure, chronic pulmonary disease. The patinet has a relatively low
   CVP but also did not respond to fluid challenges. Patient was
   anticoagulated and thus shouldn't have PE. ABG show patient isn't
   hypoxemic. No current fever. No history of hyperthyroidism or ongoing
   ischemia or MI. No history of pulmonary disease. Front runners include
   beta blocker withdrawal, anxiety/agitation and heart failure. Recent
   echo with maintained systolic function. Restarting beta blocker today.
   Will do best to control delirium and agitation with normal precautions.
   - minimize delirium
   - discontinue lines as possible
   - continue tele
   - consider fluid challenge today
   - consider eval for PE
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was weaned.  Currently stable pressures.
   - consider transfusion or IVF bolus if evidence of hypoperfusion
 none
   at this time
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - start metoprolol tartrate today
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and ethanol abuse, who presented to the hospital with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and respiratory failure requiring intubation. He underwent cardiac catheterization, which demonstrated occlusion of his left internal mammary artery (LIMA) and saphenous vein graft (SVG) occlusion. He was treated with aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin, and had a PROMUS stent placed in his LIMA.

The patient's respiratory status improved, and he was extubated and placed on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP). However, he remains hypercarbic and requires large amounts of supplemental oxygen. His sinus tachycardia is unclear in etiology, and he has a history of chronic systolic heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 51%. He also has a small lacunar infarct on his head CT scan, which may be contributing to his agitation and delirium.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, but normal creatine kinase (CK) and CKMB levels. His blood cultures are pending, and his urine culture was negative. His electrocardiogram (EKG) shows sinus tachycardia, and his chest X-ray shows bibasilar atelectatic changes without definite acute focal pneumonia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CHF and NSTEMI puts him at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure and hypercarbia put him at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Neurological complications: The patient's small lacunar infarct on his head CT scan may be contributing to his agitation and delirium, and he is at risk for further neurological complications such as stroke, seizures, and cognitive decline.
4. Infection: The patient's history of ethanol abuse and his current respiratory failure put him at risk for infection, particularly pneumonia.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and his current respiratory failure put him at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, nausea, and vomiting.
6. Renal complications: The patient's history of diabetes and his current respiratory failure put him at risk for renal complications such as acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
7. Hematological complications: The patient's history of ethanol abuse and his current respiratory failure put him at risk for hematological complications such as bleeding, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

Overall, the patient's complex medical history and current respiratory failure make him at risk for a variety of medical complications. Close monitoring and management of his condition are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with NSTEMI
   c/b respiratory failure requiring intubation, pna on abx, agitation and
   sinus tachycardia, now s/p PROMUS to LIMA.
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient presented to an outside hospital with angina
   and troponin elevation. No EKG from OSH. Likely NSTEMI given EKG at
   [**Hospital1 19**]. Serum troponin at admission of 0.04. The patient underwent
   cardiac catheterization which demonstrated occlusion of SVG-OM1 and
   LIMA-LAD grafts. The patient was very agitated during the procedure and
   the procedure was aborted. The patient returned to that cath lab and
   had a PROMUS placed in his LIMA. The patient is currently chest pain
   free and has been off NTG drip.
   - Aspirin 325mg daily
   - Clopidogrel 75mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 37.5mg TID
   - Consider adding low dose ACE inhibitor if pressures tolerate
   #. Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology. The patient was intubated on
   [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and low grade fever.
   The patient had a CT of the chest which demonstrated LLL pneumonia with
   bilateral pleural effusions. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime
   with a plan for an 8 day course. The patient was extubated on [**2182-1-27**].
   Put on BiPAP and tolerated with well. Was weaned to 50% FM and is
   currently oxygenating well. Patient is hypercarbic but with stable pH
   which means it may be chronic. Currently ABG appear stable but patient
   requiring large amounts of supplemental O2. Will continue to evaluated.
   CVP measured yesterday which was ~7 (although in context of single
   measurement is relatively meaningless).
   - continue IV vancomycin day 8, cefepime day 8 (plan for 8 day course)
   - d/c antibiotics after todays dose
   - continue frequent ABGs
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   #. Sinus tachycardia: Unclear etiology. The patient had fluid challenge
   and pRBCs without clear any change in heart rate or blood pressure.
   Differential includes hypotension, PE, beta blocker withdrawal,
   hypoxia, fever, anxiety/agitation, hyperthyroidism, ischemia/MI, heart
   failure, chronic pulmonary disease. The patinet has a relatively low
   CVP but also did not respond to fluid challenges. Patient was
   anticoagulated and thus shouldn't have PE. ABG show patient isn't
   hypoxemic. No current fever. No history of hyperthyroidism or ongoing
   ischemia or MI. No history of pulmonary disease. Front runners include
   beta blocker withdrawal, anxiety/agitation and heart failure. Recent
   echo with maintained systolic function. Restarting beta blocker today.
   Will do best to control delirium and agitation with normal precautions.
   - minimize delirium
   - continue tele
   - consider fluid challenge today
   - consider eval for PE
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was weaned.  Currently stable pressures.
   - consider transfusion or IVF bolus if evidence of hypoperfusion
 none
   at this time
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - start metoprolol tartrate today
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.
   - consider carotid u/s per neuro recs
   - f/u hemoglobin A1C
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - F/U Psych recs
   - 4 bed rail restraint, 2 ext restraints
 pulling at lines
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes as possible
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH. Increased
   dose [**1-29**] restarting feeding.  Home Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Now is outside
   window for EtOH withdrawal. Will need monitoring for benzo withdrawal.
   - SW consult  when mental status improves
   #. HLD:
   - Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
    #. GERD:
   - Lansoprazole 30mg daily
   #. Anxiety/Depression:
   - Per psychiatry, appears to be a distant diagnosis.
   - Continue to observe

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   and troponin elevation. No EKG from OSH. Likely NSTEMI given EKG at
   [**Hospital1 19**]. Serum troponin at admission of 0.04. The patient underwent
   cardiac catheterization which demonstrated occlusion of SVG-OM1 and
   LIMA-LAD grafts. The patient was very agitated during the procedure and
   the procedure was aborted. The patient returned to that cath lab and
   had a PROMUS placed in his LIMA. The patient is currently chest pain
   free and has been off NTG drip.
   - Aspirin 325mg daily
   - Clopidogrel 75mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 37.5mg TID
   - Consider adding low dose ACE inhibitor if pressures tolerate
   #. Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology. The patient was intubated on
   [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and low grade fever.
   The patient had a CT of the chest which demonstrated LLL pneumonia with
   bilateral pleural effusions. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime
   with a plan for an 8 day course. The patient was extubated on [**2182-1-27**].
   Put on BiPAP and tolerated with well. Was weaned to 50% FM and is
   currently oxygenating well. Patient is hypercarbic but with stable pH
   which means it may be chronic. Currently ABG appear stable but patient
   requiring large amounts of supplemental O2. Will continue to evaluated.
   CVP measured yesterday which was ~7 (although in context of single
   measurement is relatively meaningless).
   - continue IV vancomycin day 8, cefepime day 8 (plan for 8 day course)
   - d/c antibiotics after todays dose
   - continue frequent ABGs
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   #. Sinus tachycardia: Unclear etiology. The patient had fluid challenge
   and pRBCs without clear any change in heart rate or blood pressure.
   Differential includes hypotension, PE, beta blocker withdrawal,
   hypoxia, fever, anxiety/agitation, hyperthyroidism, ischemia/MI, heart
   failure, chronic pulmonary disease. The patinet has a relatively low
   CVP but also did not respond to fluid challenges. Patient was
   anticoagulated and thus shouldn't have PE. ABG show patient isn't
   hypoxemic. No current fever. No history of hyperthyroidism or ongoing
   ischemia or MI. No history of pulmonary disease. Front runners include
   beta blocker withdrawal, anxiety/agitation and heart failure. Recent
   echo with maintained systolic function. Restarting beta blocker today.
   Will do best to control delirium and agitation with normal precautions.
   - minimize delirium
   - continue tele
   - consider fluid challenge today
   - consider eval for PE
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was weaned.  Currently stable pressures.
   - consider transfusion or IVF bolus if evidence of hypoperfusion
 none
   at this time
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - start metoprolol tartrate today
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.
   - consider carotid u/s per neuro recs

   - F/U Neurology recs
   - F/U Psych recs
   - 4 bed rail restraint, 2 ext restraints
 pulling at lines
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes as possible
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH. Increased
   dose [**1-29**] restarting feeding.  Home Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Now is outside
   window for EtOH withdrawal. Will need monitoring for benzo withdrawal.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and ethanol (EtOH) abuse, who presented to the emergency department with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and respiratory failure requiring intubation. He underwent cardiac catheterization, which demonstrated occlusion of the saphenous vein graft (SVG) and left internal mammary artery (LIMA) grafts. A PROMUS stent was placed in the LIMA graft.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with ongoing respiratory failure, sinus tachycardia, and agitation. He has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 51%, as assessed by nuclear imaging. He also has a small lacunar infarct of indeterminate age on his computed tomography (CT) head scan.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, with ongoing oxygen requirements and hypercarbia. He may require further respiratory support, such as non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or mechanical ventilation.
2. Sinus tachycardia: The patient's sinus tachycardia may be caused by various factors, including beta blocker withdrawal, anxiety, or heart failure. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to determine the underlying cause.
3. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure may be exacerbated by his current respiratory failure and sinus tachycardia. He may require further treatment, such as diuretics, vasodilators, or inotropes.
4. Agitation and delirium: The patient's agitation and delirium may be caused by various factors, including benzodiazepine withdrawal, dementia, or delirium. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to determine the underlying cause and manage his symptoms.
5. CVA: The patient's small lacunar infarct may be a contributing factor to his agitation and delirium. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to determine the underlying cause and manage his symptoms.
6. DM: The patient's diabetes mellitus may be exacerbated by his current illness and treatment. He may require further treatment, such as insulin adjustments or glucose monitoring.
7. EtOH abuse: The patient's ethanol abuse may be a contributing factor to his current illness and treatment. He may require further evaluation and treatment, such as counseling or detoxification.
8. HLD: The patient's history of hyperlipidemia may be a contributing factor to his current illness and treatment. He may require further treatment, such as statins or lipid-lowering agents.
9. GERD: The patient's history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may be a contributing factor to his current illness and treatment. He may require further treatment, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or histamine-2 (H2) blockers.
10. Anxiety and depression: The patient's history of anxiety and depression may be a contributing factor to his current illness and treatment. He may require further evaluation and treatment, such as counseling or antidepressants.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires ongoing evaluation and treatment to manage his symptoms and prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Imaging: CXR:
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-28**], there is little change
   in the
   appearance of the central catheter and gastric tube. Persistent low
   lung
   volumes. Bibasilar atelectatic changes without definite acute focal
   pneumonia
   Assessment and Plan
   82M with history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with NSTEMI
   c/b respiratory failure requiring intubation, pna on abx, agitation and
   sinus tachycardia, now s/p PROMUS to LIMA.
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient presented to an outside hospital with angina
   and troponin elevation. No EKG from OSH. Likely NSTEMI given EKG at
   [**Hospital1 19**]. Serum troponin at admission of 0.04. The patient underwent
   cardiac catheterization which demonstrated occlusion of SVG-OM1 and
   LIMA-LAD grafts. The patient was very agitated during the procedure and
   the procedure was aborted. The patient returned to that cath lab and
   had a PROMUS placed in his LIMA. The patient is currently chest pain
   free.
   - Aspirin 325mg daily
   - Clopidogrel 75mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 37.5mg TID
   - continue lisinopril 2.5mg daily.
   #. Respiratory distress
 patient had bibasilar crackles, was volume up
   yesterday and is complaining of shortness of breath.  Patient has no
   further evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
   - vancomycin and cefipime discontinued yesterday.
   - CXR this AM
   - furosemide 40mg IV today.
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   #. Sinus tachycardia: Unclear etiology. Patient may have been
   hypovolemic before, but is now volume up.  Rate is now improved.
   - continue on metoprolol as above.
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: TTE on [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with
   global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.
   - furosemide as above.
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes as possible
   - Discontinue foley, replace with condom catheter.
   - attempt to place peripheral IV, discontinue triple lumen.
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH. Increased
   dose [**1-29**] restarting feeding.  Home Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 24u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Now is outside
   window for EtOH withdrawal. Will need monitoring for benzo withdrawal.
   -          SW consult  when mental status improves
   -          Continue thiamine, folic acid.
   #. HLD:
   - Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
    #. GERD:
   - Lansoprazole 30mg daily
   #. Anxiety/Depression:
   - Per psychiatry, appears to be a distant diagnosis.
   - Continue to observe

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, an 82-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of NSTEMI, respiratory failure, and agitation. He has a history of CABG, DM, and EtOH abuse. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has bibasilar crackles and is complaining of shortness of breath. His CXR shows persistent low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectatic changes without acute focal pneumonia.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of NSTEMI, and his cardiac catheterization showed occlusion of SVG-OM1 and LIMA-LAD grafts. He underwent a PROMUS placement in his LIMA and is currently chest pain-free.
* Neurological: The patient has a small lacunar infarct of indeterminate age on CT head, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). He is experiencing agitation, confusion, and memory impairments, which may be complicated by delirium and dementia.
* Metabolic: The patient has DM and is taking NPH and insulin sliding scale. He is also taking thiamine and folic acid.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has GERD and is taking lansoprazole.
* Anxiety/Depression: The patient is not diagnosed with anxiety or depression, but may have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to further compromise of his lung function.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of NSTEMI and occlusion of SVG-OM1 and LIMA-LAD grafts may lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
3. Neurological deterioration: The patient's small lacunar infarct and agitation may worsen, leading to further neurological compromise.
4. Metabolic complications: The patient's DM and EtOH abuse may lead to metabolic complications, such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's GERD may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as esophageal reflux or bleeding.
6. Anxiety/Depression: The patient's benzodiazepine withdrawal may lead to anxiety or depression.

The patient's current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, lisinopril, furosemide, NPH, insulin sliding scale, lansoprazole, and thiamine. His IV lines include a multi-lumen line and a prophylactic line for DVT and stress ulcer. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is planned for the CCU or Hospital Ward 289."

   pneumonia
   Assessment and Plan
   82M with history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with NSTEMI
   c/b respiratory failure requiring intubation, pna on abx, agitation and
   sinus tachycardia, now s/p PROMUS to LIMA.
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient presented to an outside hospital with angina
   and troponin elevation. No EKG from OSH. Likely NSTEMI given EKG at
   [**Hospital1 19**]. Serum troponin at admission of 0.04. The patient underwent
   cardiac catheterization which demonstrated occlusion of SVG-OM1 and
   LIMA-LAD grafts. The patient was very agitated during the procedure and
   the procedure was aborted. The patient returned to that cath lab and
   had a PROMUS placed in his LIMA. The patient is currently chest pain
   free and has been off NTG drip.
   - Aspirin 325mg daily
   - Clopidogrel 75mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 37.5mg TID
   - Consider adding low dose ACE inhibitor if pressures tolerate
   #. Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology. The patient was intubated on
   [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and low grade fever.
   The patient had a CT of the chest which demonstrated LLL pneumonia with
   bilateral pleural effusions. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime
   with a plan for an 8 day course. The patient was extubated on [**2182-1-27**].
   Put on BiPAP and tolerated with well. Was weaned to 50% FM and is
   currently oxygenating well. Patient is hypercarbic but with stable pH
   which means it may be chronic. Currently ABG appear stable but patient
   requiring large amounts of supplemental O2. Will continue to evaluated.
   CVP measured yesterday which was ~7 (although in context of single
   measurement is relatively meaningless).
   - continue IV vancomycin day 8, cefepime day 8 (plan for 8 day course)
   - d/c antibiotics after todays dose
   - continue frequent ABGs
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   #. Sinus tachycardia: Unclear etiology. The patient had fluid challenge
   and pRBCs without clear any change in heart rate or blood pressure.
   Differential includes hypotension, PE, beta blocker withdrawal,
   hypoxia, fever, anxiety/agitation, hyperthyroidism, ischemia/MI, heart
   failure, chronic pulmonary disease. The patinet has a relatively low
   CVP but also did not respond to fluid challenges. Patient was
   anticoagulated and thus shouldn't have PE. ABG show patient isn't
   hypoxemic. No current fever. No history of hyperthyroidism or ongoing
   ischemia or MI. No history of pulmonary disease. Front runners include
   beta blocker withdrawal, anxiety/agitation and heart failure. Recent
   echo with maintained systolic function. Restarting beta blocker today.
   Will do best to control delirium and agitation with normal precautions.
   - minimize delirium
   - discontinue lines as possible
   - continue tele
   - consider fluid challenge today
   - consider eval for PE
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**], but this is not the best study for EF.
   Patient with persistent fluid overload on admission, but he was not
   pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac catheterization. On transfer,
   patient demonstrates mild respiratory distress and O2 requirement,
   limited clinical exam suggests fluid overload. Received IV Lasix on
   transfer with good UOP, but was fluid overloaded as of [**1-23**] AM. TTE on
   [**1-23**] showed EF 30-35% with global hypokinesis. His Right heart cath on
   [**1-25**] had a PCWP of 15.  On [**1-26**], he remained pressor dependent, but
   levophed was weaned.  Currently stable pressures.
   - consider transfusion or IVF bolus if evidence of hypoperfusion
 none
   at this time
   - keep even fluid balance today
   - start metoprolol tartrate today
   # Agitation/Mental status changes/CVA's/Hx of TIA: Patient's cardiac
   catheterization aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to
   significant doses of Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital
   records, patient has been confused and agitated since his
   hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. At home, however, his wife states that he
   is not confused, but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As
   patient has been attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is
   not fully oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary
   process appears to be agitation with some minor component of
   dementia/delirium. Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may
   have some component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Normal metabolic
   work-up as an inpatient. CT head on [**1-24**] demonstrated a small lacunar
   infarct of indeterminate age, so neurology was consulted. Neuro finds
   Small bihemispheric subacute infarcts involving multiple vascular
   territories, suggesting a proximal source (heart or the aorta). This
   CVA may be complicating already complex delirium and dementia picture.

   dose [**1-29**] restarting feeding.  Home Gabapentin held.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Now is outside
   window for EtOH withdrawal. Will need monitoring for benzo withdrawal.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with history of CABG, DM, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with NSTEMI
   c/b respiratory failure requiring intubation, pna on abx, agitation and
   sinus tachycardia, now s/p PROMUS to LIMA.
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient presented to an outside hospital with angina
   and troponin elevation. No EKG from OSH. Likely NSTEMI given EKG at
   [**Hospital1 19**]. Serum troponin at admission of 0.04. The patient underwent
   cardiac catheterization which demonstrated occlusion of SVG-OM1 and
   LIMA-LAD grafts. The patient was very agitated during the procedure and
   the procedure was aborted. The patient returned to that cath lab and
   had a PROMUS placed in his LIMA. The patient is currently chest pain
   free and has been off NTG drip.
   - Aspirin 325mg daily
   - Clopidogrel 75mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 37.5mg TID
   - Consider adding low dose ACE inhibitor if pressures tolerate
   #. Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology. The patient was intubated on
   [**1-23**] in context of worsening respiratory status and low grade fever.
   The patient had a CT of the chest which demonstrated LLL pneumonia with
   bilateral pleural effusions. He was started on vancomycin and cefepime
   with a plan for an 8 day course. The patient was extubated on [**2182-1-27**].
   Put on BiPAP and tolerated with well. Was weaned to 50% FM and is
   currently oxygenating well. Patient is hypercarbic but with stable pH
   which means it may be chronic. Currently ABG appear stable but patient
   requiring large amounts of supplemental O2. Will continue to evaluated.
   CVP measured yesterday which was ~7 (although in context of single
   measurement is relatively meaningless).
   - continue IV vancomycin day 8, cefepime day 8 (plan for 8 day course)
   - d/c antibiotics after todays dose
   - continue frequent ABGs
   - wean off O2 as tolerated to keep SaO2 > 90%
   #. Sinus tachycardia: Unclear etiology. The patient had fluid challenge
   and pRBCs without clear any change in heart rate or blood pressure.
   Differential includes hypotension, PE, beta blocker withdrawal,
   hypoxia, fever, anxiety/agitation, hyperthyroidism, ischemia/MI, heart
   failure, chronic pulmonary disease. The patinet has a relatively low
   CVP but also did not respond to fluid challenges. Patient was
   anticoagulated and thus shouldn't have PE. ABG show patient isn't
   hypoxemic. No current fever. No history of hyperthyroidism or ongoing
   ischemia or MI. No history of pulmonary disease. Front runners include
   beta blocker withdrawal, anxiety/agitation and heart failure. Recent
   echo with maintained systolic function. Restarting beta blocker today.
