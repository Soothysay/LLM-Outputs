   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture.  He was hypotensive to
   the 90s in the ED and was admitted to the MICU for management.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF
   - Hold ASA for now given low Hct
   - Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; retransfuse for
   Hct < 25
   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed
   .
   # LEFT HIP FRACTURE
   - Ortho following; plan for total hip replacement today (open schedule
   for add-on)
   - Active type and screen; coags in AM, NPO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of diastolic CHF, AFib, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who presents from acute rehab after falling and developing a left intertrochanteric fracture. He was hypotensive in the ED and was admitted to the MICU for management.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 33.8°C, HR 72 bpm, BP 92/63 mmHg, RR 19 breaths/min, SpO2 94%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Inotropic support with dopamine and milrinone
* Fluid balance: Total fluid input 33 mL, total fluid output 400 mL, with a negative balance of -367 mL
* Respiratory support: Oxygen delivery via nasal cannula, ABG: 7.3 mmol/L
* Laboratory results: Hct 22.9%, WBC 8.2 K/uL, Plt 128 K/uL, Cr 2.4 mg/dL, Glucose 106 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA
* LEFT HIP FRACTURE
* CHF - endstage
* CKD - stage IV
* POSSIBLE PNEUMONIA
* THROMBOCYTOPENIA
* RECURRENT C. DIFF INFECTION
* Atrial Fibrillation
* RETROPERITONEAL MASS
* CHRONIC ANEMIA
* CHRONIC VENOUS STASIS
* INABILITY TO TAKE PO MEDS

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Septic shock due to sepsis from the left hip fracture or other sources
* Hypovolemia due to dehydration or acute bleed
* Vasovagal syncope due to severe pain
* Cardiogenic shock due to severe CHF
* Adrenal insufficiency
* Uremia due to CKD
* Hyperkalemia due to CKD
* Acidosis due to CKD
* Volume overload due to fluid imbalance
* Pneumonia due to possible aspiration or secondary infection
* Thrombocytopenia due to dilutional, consumptive, or chronic disease
* Recurrent C. difficile infection due to antibiotic use
* Atrial fibrillation due to underlying cardiac disease
* Retroperitoneal bleed due to trauma or other causes
* Chronic venous stasis due to immobility and CKD

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90
* Hold ASA for now due to low Hct and possible going to OR
* Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of fracture
* Cardiac consult in early AM to clear for surgery
* Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis
* Monitor for signs of complications (soft tissue hematoma, retroperitoneal bleed)
* Morphine for pain, monitoring blood pressure closely
* Repeat EKG in AM
* Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
* Gentle hydration with blood products/fluids
* Hold diuretics for now
* Monitor for signs of uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, volume overload
* Repeat CXR in AM after hydrated
* Hold levofloxacin in setting of low clinical suspicion for PNA
* Continue ipratropium nebs
* Monitor for signs of complications (soft tissue hematoma, retroperitoneal bleed)
* MRI abdomen, non-urgent
* Consider Epo for chronic anemia
* Wound care for left leg ulcer
* Teds for chronic venous stasis
* Replete electrolytes, NPO now for procedure, senna/colace/tums for prophylaxis"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture.  He was hypotensive to
   the 90s in the ED and was admitted to the MICU for management.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF
   - Hold ASA for now given low Hct
   - Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; retransfuse for
   Hct < 25
   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone;
   possibly [**1-31**] Foley insertion)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed
   .
   # LEFT HIP FRACTURE
   - Ortho following; plan for total hip replacement today (open schedule
   for add-on)
   - Active type and screen; coags in AM, NPO
   - Cardiac consult in early AM to clear for surgery (followed by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 3014**]
   - Pneumoboots  (no SCH given prior concern for possible HIT) for DVT
   prophylaxis
   - Monitor for signs of complications (soft tissue hematoma,
   retroperitoneal bleed)
   - Morphine for pain, monitoring blood pressure closely
   .
   # CHF - endstage. Difficult to titrate meds in setting of CKD. Weight
   baseline about 160, on [**4-6**] is 167 lb, had been stable throughout last
   week in rehab.
   - Daily weights
   - Hold torsemide for now in setting of hypotension
   - Hold spironolactone for now in setting of hypotension
   - Hold ASA for now in setting of hypotension and anemia and possibly
   going to OR
   - Continue statin
   - Repeat EKG in AM
   .
   # CKD - stage IV. Creatinine baseline 2.0, on admission elevated to
   2.7, now trending down to 2.4. Likely prerenal in setting of
   hypotension, though FEUN 51% and FeNa 5%. Currently self-diuresing
   well.
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Gentle hydration with blood products/fluids
   - Hold diuretics for now
   - Monitor for signs of uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, volume overload
   .
   # POSSIBLE PNEUMONIA. Initial CXR concerning for retrocardiac opacity.
   Pt received levofloxacin in ED. No WBC, no respiratory symptoms.
   - Repeat CXR in AM after hydrated
   - Hold levofloxacin in setting of low clinical suspicion for PNA and
   multiple episodes of C. Diff.
   - Sputum cx not yet logged, urine legionella negative
   - Continue ipratropium nebs
   .
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA. Had pancytopenia at prior admission, normalized
   during treatment. HIT ruled out, but heparin products avoided because
   initial GP4 antibody positive (Serotonin assay negative). DDx
   dilutional (most likely) vs consumptive vs chronic disease
   - Monitor for now, transfuse for Plt < 30
   .
   # RECURRENT C. DIFF INFECTION. Currently on PO Vanco taper. No diarrhea
   currently.
   - Continue PO Vancomycin taper as above.
   - Avoid unnecessary antibiotics if possible
   - ID approval required in AM.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation. Holding ASA in setting of low Hct; not on
   Coumadin due to GIB.
   - Hold ASA for now.
   - Metoprolol for rate control, hold for SBP < 100.
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS: Adrenal mass seen on CT this admission (8x6.2
   cm). Non-urgent adrenal MRI recommended by radiology for further
   characterization. Not evident on prior MRI [**2-7**], but ""Large but poorly
   assessed hypoechoic area (4 cm) in the region of the left upper pole,
   for which differential considerations include an adrenal or renal mass,
   or a renal cyst"" seen on abdominal ultrasound [**1-8**]. Cortisol wnl.
   - MRI abdomen, non-urgent
   .
   # CHRONIC ANEMIA. Baseline Hct 30; likely secondary to CKD/chronic
   disease.
   - Consider Epo
   .
   # CHRONIC VENOUS STASIS.
   - Wound care for left leg ulcer.
   - Teds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypotension/acute bleed/hematuria, and the differential diagnosis includes septic shock, hypovolemia, vasovagal, cardiogenic, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient is also at risk for pneumonia, and the CXR is concerning for retrocardiac opacity. The patient has thrombocytopenia, and the differential diagnosis includes dilutional, consumptive, and chronic disease.

The patient has been prescribed various medications, including morphine for pain, and the plan is to continue statin and repeat EKG in the morning. The patient's family has been informed of the plan, and the patient has a code status of full code for acute situations and OR but does not wish to be chronically vented.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he is at risk for further hypotension, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Acute bleed: The patient has hematuria, and there is a risk of further bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and organ dysfunction.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has a CXR concerning for retrocardiac opacity, and there is a risk of developing pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, and there is a risk of further bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and organ dysfunction.
5. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's cortisol level is normal, but there is a risk of adrenal insufficiency, which can lead to hypotension, hyponatremia, and adrenal crisis.
6. CKD: The patient has stage IV CKD, and there is a risk of further kidney damage and failure.
7. CHF: The patient has end-stage CHF, and there is a risk of further heart failure, which can lead to cardiogenic shock and organ dysfunction.

It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings closely to identify any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent further deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture.  He was hypotensive to
   the 90s in the ED and was admitted to the MICU for management.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture.  He was hypotensive to
   the 90s in the ED and was admitted to the MICU for management.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF
   - Hold ASA for now given low Hct
   - Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; retransfuse for
   Hct < 25
   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone;
   possibly [**1-31**] Foley insertion)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed
   - Goal UOP > 50 cc/hr
   .
   # LEFT HIP FRACTURE
   - Ortho following; plan for total hip replacement today (open schedule
   for add-on)
   - Active type and screen; coags in AM, NPO
   - Cardiac consult in early AM to clear for surgery (followed by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 3014**]
   - Pneumoboots  (no SCH given prior concern for possible HIT) for DVT
   prophylaxis
   - Monitor for signs of complications (soft tissue hematoma,
   retroperitoneal bleed)
   - Morphine for pain, monitoring blood pressure closely
   - Continue BB
   .
   # CHF - endstage. Difficult to titrate meds in setting of CKD. Weight
   baseline about 160, on [**4-6**] is 167 lb, had been stable throughout last
   week in rehab.
   - Daily weights
   - Hold torsemide for now in setting of hypotension
   - Hold spironolactone for now in setting of hypotension
   - Continue BB
   - Hold ASA for now in setting of hypotension and anemia and possibly
   going to OR
   - Continue statin
   - Repeat EKG in AM
   - Goal UOP > 50 cc/hr
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: Possibly secondary to hemolysis post-transfusions.
   - Re-check EKG this AM
   - Re-check K prior to OR
   - Restart home torsemide dose this morning
   - Goal K < 5.5 prior to OR (consider kayexelate if needed)
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS: Adrenal mass seen on CT this admission (8x6.2
   cm). Non-urgent adrenal MRI recommended by radiology for further
   characterization. Not evident on prior MRI [**2-7**], but ""Large but poorly
   assessed hypoechoic area (4 cm) in the region of the left upper pole,
   for which differential considerations include an adrenal or renal mass,
   or a renal cyst"" seen on abdominal ultrasound [**1-8**]. Cortisol wnl.
   - MRI abdomen, non-urgent
   .
   # CKD - stage IV. Creatinine baseline 2.0, on admission elevated to
   2.7, now trending down to 2.4. Likely prerenal in setting of
   hypotension, though FEUN 51% and FeNa 5%. Currently self-diuresing
   well.
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Gentle hydration with blood products/fluids
   - Hold diuretics for now
   - Monitor for signs of uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, volume overload
   .
   # POSSIBLE PNEUMONIA. Initial CXR concerning for retrocardiac opacity.
   Pt received levofloxacin in ED. No WBC, no respiratory symptoms.
   - Repeat CXR in AM after hydrated
   - Hold levofloxacin in setting of low clinical suspicion for PNA and
   multiple episodes of C. Diff.
   - Sputum cx not yet logged, urine legionella negative
   - Continue ipratropium nebs
   .
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA. Had pancytopenia at prior admission, normalized
   during treatment. HIT ruled out, but heparin products avoided because
   initial GP4 antibody positive (Serotonin assay negative). DDx
   dilutional (most likely) vs consumptive vs chronic disease
   - Monitor for now, transfuse for Plt < 30
   .
   # RECURRENT C. DIFF INFECTION. Currently on PO Vanco taper. No diarrhea
   currently.
   - Continue PO Vancomycin taper as above.
   - Avoid unnecessary antibiotics if possible
   - ID approval required in AM.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation. Holding ASA in setting of low Hct; not on
   Coumadin due to GIB.
   - Hold ASA for now.
   - Metoprolol for rate control, hold for SBP < 100.
   .
   # CHRONIC ANEMIA. Baseline Hct 30; likely secondary to CKD/chronic
   disease.
   - Consider Epo
   .
   # CHRONIC VENOUS STASIS.
   - Wound care for left leg ulcer.
   - Teds
   .
   # INABILITY TO TAKE PO MEDS. Pt somewhat sleep late last night, and PO
   meds held. Will monitor and if no improvement during day will consult
   speech/swallow.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Patient's Condition:**

* The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of diastolic CHF, AFib, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who presents with a left intertrochanteric fracture and is admitted to the MICU for management.
* The patient has been transfused with 2 units of pRBCs and is currently hypotensive, with a SBP in the 100s.
* The patient has a history of C. Diff infection and is currently on PO Vanco taper.
* The patient has chronic anemia and chronic venous stasis.
* The patient has a retroperitoneal mass seen on CT, which is being further characterized with an MRI.
* The patient has thrombocytopenia and is being monitored for signs of bleeding.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Hypotension: The patient's SBP is currently in the 100s, and there is a risk of further hypotension due to dehydration, acute bleed, or vasovagal reaction.
* Acute Bleed: The patient's Hct is 22.9, and there is a risk of acute bleed due to the patient's fracture and the use of anticoagulant medications.
* Septic Shock: The patient's WBC is normal, but there is a risk of septic shock due to the patient's history of C. Diff infection and the use of antibiotics.
* Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 94%, but there is a risk of respiratory failure due to the patient's chronic lung disease and the use of sedatives.
* Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac status is compromised due to his history of CHF and AFib, and there is a risk of cardiac arrest due to the patient's hypotension and the use of anticoagulant medications.
* Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine is 2.4, and there is a risk of renal failure due to the patient's chronic kidney disease and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
* Pneumonia: The patient's initial CXR is concerning for retrocardiac opacity, and there is a risk of pneumonia due to the patient's history of respiratory disease and the use of antibiotics.
* Thrombosis: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia and is at risk of thrombosis due to the use of anticoagulant medications.

**Plan:**

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and adjust medications as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's blood products and adjust transfusions as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust medications as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's renal status and adjust medications as necessary.
* Consider the use of kayexelate to treat hyperkalemia.
* Consider the use of epo to treat chronic anemia.
* Consider the use of antibiotics to treat possible pneumonia.
* Consider the use of anticoagulant medications to treat possible thrombosis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of diastolic CHF, AFib, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who presents to the MICU for hypotension after falling at his nursing home and being found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture. He underwent ORIF with TFN. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, and his baseline BP is in the 90s-100s. He has also been experiencing left arm and shoulder pain, and has a retroperitoneal mass seen on CT scan. He has been diagnosed with hyperkalemia, thrombocytopenia, and possible pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to septic shock, hypovolemia, vasovagal response, cardiogenic shock, or adrenal insufficiency. The patient's poor cardiac function and dehydration may contribute to his hypotension.
2. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding could be due to retroperitoneal bleed, soft tissue hematoma, or gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's history of CKD and CHF may increase his risk of bleeding.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's initial CXR showed concerning for retrocardiac opacity, and he received levofloxacin in the ED. However, his WBC count is normal, and he does not have respiratory symptoms. A repeat CXR and sputum culture are needed to confirm the diagnosis.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia could be due to dilutional, consumptive, or chronic disease. His history of pancytopenia at a prior admission and normalization during treatment may suggest a chronic disease.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia could be due to hemolysis post-transfusions, CKD, or other electrolyte imbalances. His history of CKD and CHF may increase his risk of hyperkalemia.
6. Chronic Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia could be due to CKD, chronic disease, or other underlying conditions. His history of chronic anemia and need for transfusions may indicate a chronic disease.
7. Chronic Venous Stasis: The patient's chronic venous stasis could be due to his CKD and CHF. His history of wound care for left leg ulcer may indicate a chronic condition.
8. Inability to Take PO Meds: The patient's inability to take PO meds may be due to his sleep patterns or other underlying conditions. His history of chronic anemia and need for transfusions may indicate a chronic disease.
9. Recurrent C. Diff Infection: The patient's recurrent C. Diff infection may be due to his underlying conditions, including CKD and CHF. His history of PO Vancomycin taper may indicate a chronic condition.
10. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may be due to his underlying conditions, including CHF and CKD. His history of ASA use and low Hct may indicate a chronic condition.

Overall, the patient's complex medical history and current condition require careful monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   CT ABDOMEN ([**4-6**]):
   1. Left intertrochanteric hip fracture.
   2. Large left adrenal mass, which is not characterized on non-contrast
   examination. However, the imaging features are not consistent with an
   adrenal
   hematoma. A nonurgent adrenal MR recommended for further
   characterization.
   3. Cholelithiasis.
   4. Atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta and its
   branches.
   5. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
   6. Prostatic enlargement.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture admitted to the MICU
   for hypotension now  day 1 s/p ORIF.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF
   - Hold ASA for now given low Hct
   - Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; re-transfuse
   for Hct < 25
   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone;
   possibly [**1-31**] Foley insertion)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed
   - Goal UOP > 50 cc/hr
   .
   # LEFT HIP FRACTURE:  s/p ORIF with TFN
   - F/U orthopedics recs
   - WBAT
   - Monitor for signs of complications (soft tissue hematoma,
   retroperitoneal bleed)
   - Morphine for pain, monitoring blood pressure closely
   - Continue BB
   - enoxaparin SQ 30mg Q24 monitor closely given history of HIT positive
   antibody but negative serotonin release assay
   .
   # CHF - endstage. Difficult to titrate meds in setting of CKD. Weight
   baseline about 160, on [**4-6**] is 167 lb, had been stable throughout last
   week in rehab.
   - Daily weights
   - continue torsemide 40 [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Hold spironolactone for now in setting of hyperkalemia
   - Continue BB
   - discuss restarting ASA
   - Continue statin
   - Goal UOP > 50 cc/hr
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: Possibly secondary to hemolysis post-transfusions.
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   - hold spironolactone
   - Restart home torsemide dose this morning
   - Goal K < 5.5 prior to OR (consider kayexelate if needed)
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS: Adrenal mass seen on CT this admission (8x6.2
   cm). Non-urgent adrenal MRI recommended by radiology for further
   characterization. Not evident on prior MRI [**2-7**], but ""Large but poorly
   assessed hypoechoic area (4 cm) in the region of the left upper pole,
   for which differential considerations include an adrenal or renal mass,
   or a renal cyst"" seen on abdominal ultrasound [**1-8**]. Cortisol wnl.
   - MRI abdomen, non-urgent
   .
   # CKD - stage IV. Creatinine baseline 2.0, on admission elevated to
   2.7, now trending up to 3.2. Likely prerenal in setting of hypotension,
   though FEUN 51% and FeNa 5%. Currently self-diuresing well.
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Gentle hydration with blood products/fluids
   - continue torsemide
   - Monitor for signs of uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, volume overload
   .
   # POSSIBLE PNEUMONIA. Initial CXR concerning for retrocardiac opacity.
   Pt received levofloxacin in ED. No WBC, no respiratory symptoms.
   - Repeat CXR in AM after hydrated
   - Hold levofloxacin in setting of low clinical suspicion for PNA and
   multiple episodes of C. Diff.
   - Sputum cx not yet logged, urine legionella negative
   - Continue ipratropium nebs
   .
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA. Had pancytopenia at prior admission, normalized
   during treatment. HIT ruled out, but heparin products avoided because
   initial GP4 antibody positive (Serotonin assay negative). DDx
   dilutional (most likely) vs consumptive vs chronic disease
   - Monitor for now, transfuse for Plt < 30
   .
   # RECURRENT C. DIFF INFECTION. Currently on PO Vanco taper. No diarrhea
   currently.
   - Continue PO Vancomycin taper as above.
   - Avoid unnecessary antibiotics if possible
   - ID approval required in AM.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation. Holding ASA in setting of low Hct; not on
   Coumadin due to GIB.
   - Hold ASA for now.
   - Metoprolol for rate control, hold for SBP < 100.
   .
   # CHRONIC ANEMIA. Baseline Hct 30; likely secondary to CKD/chronic
   disease.
   - Consider Epo
   .
   # CHRONIC VENOUS STASIS.
   - Wound care for left leg ulcer.
   - Teds
   .
   # INABILITY TO TAKE PO MEDS. Pt somewhat sleep late last night, and PO
   meds held. Will monitor and if no improvement during day will consult
   speech/swallow.
   - Crush meds PRN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of diastolic CHF, AFib, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who presents to the MICU with hypotension, acute bleed, and hematuria. He had a left intertrochanteric fracture and underwent ORIF with TFN. The patient has a complex medical history, including chronic anemia, chronic venous stasis, and recurrent C. diff infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and he is at risk of further hypotension, which can lead to organ failure.
2. Acute bleed: The patient has a history of bleeding complications, including retroperitoneal bleed, and is at risk of further bleeding.
3. Hematuria: The patient has hematuria, which can be a sign of a serious underlying condition, such as a urinary tract infection or kidney injury.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of CHF and is at risk of respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by his current condition.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of recurrent C. diff infection and is at risk of further infection, which can be life-threatening.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which can increase his risk of bleeding complications.
8. Chronic anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which can increase his risk of cardiovascular complications.
9. Chronic venous stasis: The patient has chronic venous stasis, which can increase his risk of wound complications and infection.
10. Inability to take PO meds: The patient is unable to take PO meds, which can increase his risk of medication errors and complications.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of his condition to prevent and treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's lab results show acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 25 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 5.7 mmol/L, sodium level of 127 mmol/L, and chloride level of 107 mmol/L. The patient's hemoglobin level is 8.4 g/dL, and their platelet count is 128,000/μL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypovolemia, sepsis, or nephrotoxic medications.
2. Hyperkalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory depression.
3. Hypotension, which can worsen renal function and increase the risk of sepsis.
4. Respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by the patient's atrial fibrillation and respiratory support.
5. Sepsis, which can be caused by the patient's underlying injuries, surgical procedures, or infections.
6. Thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
7. Electrolyte imbalances, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory depression.
8. Pain management issues, which can lead to inadequate pain control and increased risk of complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and electrolyte levels closely.
2. Adjust the patient's fluid management and electrolyte replacement therapy as needed to prevent further complications.
3. Consider initiating dialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to manage the patient's acute renal failure.
4. Monitor the patient's pain levels and adjust pain management therapy as needed to ensure adequate pain control.
5. Consider initiating antibiotics and antifungals to prevent infections and sepsis.
6. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusing platelets if the count remains low.
7. Continue to provide respiratory support and monitor the patient's oxygen saturation levels.
8. Consider initiating stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis to prevent complications."

   CT ABDOMEN ([**4-6**]):
   1. Left intertrochanteric hip fracture.
   2. Large left adrenal mass, which is not characterized on non-contrast
   examination. However, the imaging features are not consistent with an
   adrenal
   hematoma. A nonurgent adrenal MR recommended for further
   characterization.
   3. Cholelithiasis.
   4. Atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta and its
   branches.
   5. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
   6. Prostatic enlargement.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture admitted to the MICU
   for hypotension now  day 1 s/p ORIF.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF
   - Hold ASA for now given low Hct
   - Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; retransfuse for
   Hct < 25
   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone;
   possibly [**1-31**] Foley insertion)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed
   - Goal UOP > 50 cc/hr
   .
   # LEFT HIP FRACTURE
   - Ortho following; plan for total hip replacement today (open schedule
   for add-on)
   - Active type and screen; coags in AM, NPO
   - Cardiac consult in early AM to clear for surgery (followed by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 3014**]
   - Pneumoboots  (no SCH given prior concern for possible HIT) for DVT
   prophylaxis
   - Monitor for signs of complications (soft tissue hematoma,
   retroperitoneal bleed)
   - Morphine for pain, monitoring blood pressure closely
   - Continue BB
   .
   # CHF - endstage. Difficult to titrate meds in setting of CKD. Weight
   baseline about 160, on [**4-6**] is 167 lb, had been stable throughout last
   week in rehab.
   - Daily weights
   - Hold torsemide for now in setting of hypotension
   - Hold spironolactone for now in setting of hypotension
   - Continue BB
   - Hold ASA for now in setting of hypotension and anemia and possibly
   going to OR
   - Continue statin
   - Repeat EKG in AM
   - Goal UOP > 50 cc/hr
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: Possibly secondary to hemolysis post-transfusions.
   - Re-check EKG this AM
   - Re-check K prior to OR
   - Restart home torsemide dose this morning
   - Goal K < 5.5 prior to OR (consider kayexelate if needed)
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS: Adrenal mass seen on CT this admission (8x6.2
   cm). Non-urgent adrenal MRI recommended by radiology for further
   characterization. Not evident on prior MRI [**2-7**], but ""Large but poorly
   assessed hypoechoic area (4 cm) in the region of the left upper pole,
   for which differential considerations include an adrenal or renal mass,
   or a renal cyst"" seen on abdominal ultrasound [**1-8**]. Cortisol wnl.
   - MRI abdomen, non-urgent
   .
   # CKD - stage IV. Creatinine baseline 2.0, on admission elevated to
   2.7, now trending down to 2.4. Likely prerenal in setting of
   hypotension, though FEUN 51% and FeNa 5%. Currently self-diuresing
   well.
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Gentle hydration with blood products/fluids
   - Hold diuretics for now
   - Monitor for signs of uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, volume overload
   .
   # POSSIBLE PNEUMONIA. Initial CXR concerning for retrocardiac opacity.
   Pt received levofloxacin in ED. No WBC, no respiratory symptoms.
   - Repeat CXR in AM after hydrated
   - Hold levofloxacin in setting of low clinical suspicion for PNA and
   multiple episodes of C. Diff.
   - Sputum cx not yet logged, urine legionella negative
   - Continue ipratropium nebs
   .
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA. Had pancytopenia at prior admission, normalized
   during treatment. HIT ruled out, but heparin products avoided because
   initial GP4 antibody positive (Serotonin assay negative). DDx
   dilutional (most likely) vs consumptive vs chronic disease
   - Monitor for now, transfuse for Plt < 30
   .
   # RECURRENT C. DIFF INFECTION. Currently on PO Vanco taper. No diarrhea
   currently.
   - Continue PO Vancomycin taper as above.
   - Avoid unnecessary antibiotics if possible
   - ID approval required in AM.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation. Holding ASA in setting of low Hct; not on
   Coumadin due to GIB.
   - Hold ASA for now.
   - Metoprolol for rate control, hold for SBP < 100.
   .
   # CHRONIC ANEMIA. Baseline Hct 30; likely secondary to CKD/chronic
   disease.
   - Consider Epo
   .
   # CHRONIC VENOUS STASIS.
   - Wound care for left leg ulcer.
   - Teds
   .
   # INABILITY TO TAKE PO MEDS. Pt somewhat sleep late last night, and PO
   meds held. Will monitor and if no improvement during day will consult
   speech/swallow.
   - Crush meds PRN
   .
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes, NPO now for procedure, senna/colace/tums

   CT ABDOMEN ([**4-6**]):
   1. Left intertrochanteric hip fracture.
   2. Large left adrenal mass, which is not characterized on non-contrast
   examination. However, the imaging features are not consistent with an
   adrenal
   hematoma. A nonurgent adrenal MR recommended for further
   characterization.
   3. Cholelithiasis.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture admitted to the MICU
   for hypotension now  day 1 s/p ORIF.

   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of diastolic CHF, AFib, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who presents to the ICU with hypotension after falling at his nursing home and being found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture. He underwent ORIF of the hip fracture and was given 1 unit of pRBC for a brief SBP of 70s. He has a history of recurrent C. diff infection and is currently on PO Vanco taper. He also has chronic anemia, chronic venous stasis, and inability to take PO meds.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.2°C, HR 92 bpm, BP 68/39 mmHg, RR 14 breaths/min, SpO2 97%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) 11 cm, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) 12 mmHg
* Fluid balance: Total in 1,990 mL, total out 1,100 mL, balance 890 mL
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula oxygen, standby ventilation
* Laboratory results: Hb 8.4 g/dL, Hct 22.8%, Plt 128 K/uL, Cr 2.4 mg/dL, K 5.7 mmol/L, Na 140 mmol/L, Ca 8.7 mg/dL, Mg 1.9 mg/dL, PO4 5.8 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to dehydration, acute bleed, vasovagal response, cardiogenic shock, or adrenal insufficiency. Close monitoring of blood pressure and volume status is necessary.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia may be secondary to hemolysis post-transfusions. Re-checking of EKG and potassium levels is necessary.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be due to dilutional, consumptive, or chronic disease. Close monitoring of platelet count and transfusion requirements is necessary.
4. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's stage IV CKD may exacerbate his hypotension and electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring of creatinine and electrolyte levels is necessary.
5. Chronic anemia: The patient's chronic anemia may worsen his hypotension and fatigue. Consideration of Epo therapy may be necessary.
6. Chronic venous stasis: The patient's chronic venous stasis may lead to wound complications. Close monitoring of wound care and prophylactic measures is necessary.
7. Inability to take PO meds: The patient's inability to take PO meds may lead to inadequate treatment of his underlying conditions. Crush meds PRN and consult speech/swallow therapy if necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic status, and laboratory results.
2. Re-check EKG and potassium levels regularly to monitor for hyperkalemia.
3. Continue to manage the patient's thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions as necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's chronic kidney disease and adjust medications accordingly.
5. Consider Epo therapy for the patient's chronic anemia.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's chronic venous stasis and provide wound care as necessary.
7. Crush meds PRN and consult speech/swallow therapy if necessary due to the patient's inability to take PO meds.
8. Consider non-urgent adrenal MRI for further characterization of the adrenal mass."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. The patient was recently operated on for a femoral neck fracture and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient has a history of allergies, including quinidine, propranolol, heparin agents, warfarin, and zolpidem.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.2°C (97.2°F)
* Heart rate: 88 bpm (68-116 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 104/49 mmHg (61-132/121 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (11-21 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient is experiencing hypotension, and their blood pressure is being closely monitored. They are also experiencing acute renal failure, with oliguria and hyperkalemia. The etiology of the hyperkalemia is unclear.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on anticoagulation therapy. They also have anemia secondary to blood loss.

The patient's physical examination is notable for tenderness over the left shoulder, with discomfort on passive abduction of the shoulder joint. They also have essential tremor.

The patient's laboratory results are:

* Hemoglobin: 8.4 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 8.2
* Platelet count: 128
* Creatinine: 2.4 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 5.8 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes further evaluation of the left shoulder for potential fracture or dislocation, as well as further evaluation of the adrenal mass. They will also require continued management of their hypotension, acute renal failure, and hyperkalemia.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Pulmonary embolism due to the patient's history of femoral neck fracture and the use of anticoagulation therapy
* Sepsis due to the patient's invasive ventilation and the presence of a central line
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's atrial fibrillation and the use of anticoagulation therapy
* Further deterioration of the patient's renal function due to the presence of acute renal failure
* Development of respiratory failure due to the patient's ongoing respiratory support.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure the best possible outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture admitted to the MICU
   for hypotension now  day 1 s/p ORIF.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF
   - Hold ASA for now given low Hct
   - Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; 1 unit
   overnight.  re-transfuse for Hct < 25
   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone;
   possibly [**1-31**] Foley insertion)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed
   - Goal UOP > 30 cc/hr, though currently 10-20ml/hr
   .
   # LEFT HIP FRACTURE:  s/p ORIF with TFN
   - F/U orthopedics recs
   - WBAT
   - Monitor for signs of complications (soft tissue hematoma,
   retroperitoneal bleed)
   - Morphine for pain, monitoring blood pressure closely
   - Continue BB
   - enoxaparin SQ 30mg Q24 monitor closely given history of HIT positive
   antibody but negative serotonin release assay
   .
   # LEFT ARM/SHOULDER PAIN:  Patient may have injured LUE during fall
   he landed on his left side, but is unable to recall whether he had pain
   in his arm at that time. Limited internal/external rotation of L
   shoulder on exam.
   - Plain films of shoulder with no fracture or dislocation
   .
   # CHF - endstage. Difficult to titrate meds in setting of CKD. Weight
   baseline about 160, on [**4-6**] is 167 lb, had been stable throughout last
   week in rehab.
   - Daily weights
   - Hold torsemide 40 [**Hospital1 7**] given elevated creatinine
   - Hold spironolactone for now in setting of hyperkalemia
   - Continue BB
   - discuss restarting ASA
   - Continue statin
   - Goal UOP > 30 cc/hr
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: Possibly secondary to hemolysis post-transfusions.
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   - hold spironolactone
   - Hold home torsemide dose this morning
   - Goal K < 5.5 prior to OR (consider kayexelate if needed)
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS: Adrenal mass seen on CT this admission (8x6.2
   cm). Non-urgent adrenal MRI recommended by radiology for further
   characterization. Not evident on prior MRI [**2-7**], but ""Large but poorly
   assessed hypoechoic area (4 cm) in the region of the left upper pole,
   for which differential considerations include an adrenal or renal mass,
   or a renal cyst"" seen on abdominal ultrasound [**1-8**]. Cortisol wnl.
   - MRI abdomen, non-urgent
   .
   # CKD - stage IV. Creatinine baseline 2.0, on admission elevated to
   2.7, now trending up to 3.9. Likely prerenal in setting of hypotension,
   though FEUN 51% and FeNa 5%. Creatinine now up to 3.9 post-op; UOP
   dwindling
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Gentle hydration with blood products/fluids
   - Hold torsemide
   - Monitor for signs of uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, volume overload
   -
   .
   # POSSIBLE PNEUMONIA. Initial CXR concerning for retrocardiac opacity.
   Pt received levofloxacin in ED. No WBC, no respiratory symptoms.
   - Repeat CXR showed retrocardiac opacity with ? atelectasis vs
   consolidation
   - Hold levofloxacin in setting of low clinical suspicion for PNA and
   multiple episodes of C. Diff.
   - Sputum cx not yet logged, urine legionella negative
   - Continue ipratropium nebs
   .
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA. Had pancytopenia at prior admission, normalized
   during treatment. HIT ruled out, but heparin products avoided because
   initial GP4 antibody positive (Serotonin assay negative). DDx
   dilutional (most likely) vs consumptive vs chronic disease
   - Monitor for now, transfuse for Plt < 30
   .
   # RECURRENT C. DIFF INFECTION. Currently on PO Vanco taper. No diarrhea
   currently.
   - Continue PO Vancomycin taper as above.
   - Avoid unnecessary antibiotics if possible
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation. Holding ASA in setting of low Hct; not on
   Coumadin due to GIB.
   - Hold ASA for now.
   - Metoprolol for rate control, hold for SBP < 100.
   .
   # CHRONIC ANEMIA. Baseline Hct 30; likely secondary to CKD/chronic
   disease.
   - Consider Epo
   .
   # CHRONIC VENOUS STASIS.
   - Wound care for left leg ulcer.
   - Teds
   .
   # INABILITY TO TAKE PO MEDS. Pt somewhat sleep late last night, and PO
   meds held. Will monitor and if no improvement during day will consult
   speech/swallow.
   - Crush meds PRN
   .
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes, NPO now for procedure, senna/colace/tums

If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture admitted to the MICU
   for hypotension now  day 1 s/p ORIF.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF
   - Hold ASA for now given low Hct
   - Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; 1 unit
   overnight.  re-transfuse for Hct < 25
   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone;
   possibly [**1-31**] Foley insertion)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed
   - Goal UOP > 30 cc/hr, though currently 10-20ml/hr
   .
   # LEFT HIP FRACTURE:  s/p ORIF with TFN
   - F/U orthopedics recs
   - WBAT
   - Monitor for signs of complications (soft tissue hematoma,
   retroperitoneal bleed)
   - Morphine for pain, monitoring blood pressure closely
   - Continue BB
   - enoxaparin SQ 30mg Q24 monitor closely given history of HIT positive
   antibody but negative serotonin release assay
   .
   # LEFT ARM/SHOULDER PAIN:  Patient may have injured LUE during fall
   he landed on his left side, but is unable to recall whether he had pain
   in his arm at that time. Limited internal/external rotation of L
   shoulder on exam.
   - Plain films of shoulder with no fracture or dislocation
   .
   # CHF - endstage. Difficult to titrate meds in setting of CKD. Weight
   baseline about 160, on [**4-6**] is 167 lb, had been stable throughout last
   week in rehab.
   - Daily weights
   - Hold torsemide 40 [**Hospital1 7**] given elevated creatinine
   - Hold spironolactone for now in setting of hyperkalemia
   - Continue BB
   - discuss restarting ASA
   - Continue statin
   - Goal UOP > 30 cc/hr
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: Possibly secondary to hemolysis post-transfusions.
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   - hold spironolactone
   - Hold home torsemide dose this morning
   - Goal K < 5.5 prior to OR (consider kayexelate if needed)
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS: Adrenal mass seen on CT this admission (8x6.2
   cm). Non-urgent adrenal MRI recommended by radiology for further
   characterization. Not evident on prior MRI [**2-7**], but ""Large but poorly
   assessed hypoechoic area (4 cm) in the region of the left upper pole,
   for which differential considerations include an adrenal or renal mass,
   or a renal cyst"" seen on abdominal ultrasound [**1-8**]. Cortisol wnl.
   - MRI abdomen, non-urgent
   .
   # CKD - stage IV. Creatinine baseline 2.0, on admission elevated to
   2.7, now trending up to 3.9. Likely prerenal in setting of hypotension,
   though FEUN 51% and FeNa 5%. Creatinine now up to 3.9 post-op; UOP
   dwindling
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Gentle hydration with blood products/fluids
   - Hold torsemide
   - Monitor for signs of uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, volume overload
   -
   .
   # POSSIBLE PNEUMONIA. Initial CXR concerning for retrocardiac opacity.
   Pt received levofloxacin in ED. No WBC, no respiratory symptoms.
   - Repeat CXR showed retrocardiac opacity with ? atelectasis vs
   consolidation
   - Hold levofloxacin in setting of low clinical suspicion for PNA and
   multiple episodes of C. Diff.
   - Sputum cx not yet logged, urine legionella negative
   - Continue ipratropium nebs
   .
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA. Had pancytopenia at prior admission, normalized
   during treatment. HIT ruled out, but heparin products avoided because
   initial GP4 antibody positive (Serotonin assay negative). DDx
   dilutional (most likely) vs consumptive vs chronic disease
   - Monitor for now, transfuse for Plt < 30
   .
   # RECURRENT C. DIFF INFECTION. Currently on PO Vanco taper. No diarrhea
   currently.
   - Continue PO Vancomycin taper as above.
   - Avoid unnecessary antibiotics if possible
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation. Holding ASA in setting of low Hct; not on
   Coumadin due to GIB.
   - Hold ASA for now.
   - Metoprolol for rate control, hold for SBP < 100.
   .
   # CHRONIC ANEMIA. Baseline Hct 30; likely secondary to CKD/chronic
   disease.
   - Consider Epo
   .
   # CHRONIC VENOUS STASIS.
   - Wound care for left leg ulcer.
   - Teds
   .
   # INABILITY TO TAKE PO MEDS. Pt somewhat sleep late last night, and PO
   meds held. Will monitor and if no improvement during day will consult
   speech/swallow.
   - Crush meds PRN

3. Vasovagal shock due to severe pain.
4. Adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal).
5. Hyperkalemia (possibly secondary to hemolysis post-transfusions).
6. Uremia (creatinine trending up to 3.9 mg/dL).
7. Acidosis (lactic acid 1.7 mmol/L).
8. Volume overload (fluid balance 1,735 mL).
9. Pneumonia (initial CXR concerning for retrocardiac opacity).
10. Thrombocytopenia (HIT ruled out, but heparin products avoided).
11. Recurrent C. diff infection (currently on PO Vanco taper).
12. Atrial fibrillation (holding ASA in setting of low Hct; not on Coumadin due to GIB).
13. Chronic anemia (baseline Hct 30; likely secondary to CKD/chronic disease).
14. Chronic venous stasis (wound care for left leg ulcer).

The patient requires close monitoring for these potential complications and ongoing management of his underlying medical conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture admitted to the MICU
   for hypotension now  day 1 s/p ORIF.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF
   - Hold ASA for now given low Hct
   - Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; 1 unit
   overnight.  re-transfuse for Hct < 25
   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone;
   possibly [**1-31**] Foley insertion)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed
   - Goal UOP > 30 cc/hr, though currently 10-20ml/hr
   .
   # LEFT HIP FRACTURE:  s/p ORIF with TFN
   - F/U orthopedics recs
   - WBAT
   - Monitor for signs of complications (soft tissue hematoma,
   retroperitoneal bleed)
   - Morphine for pain, monitoring blood pressure closely
   - Continue BB
   - enoxaparin SQ 30mg Q24 monitor closely given history of HIT positive
   antibody but negative serotonin release assay
   .
   # CKD - stage IV. Creatinine baseline 2.0, on admission elevated to
   2.7, now trending up to 3.9. Likely prerenal in setting of hypotension,
   though FEUN 51% and FeNa 5%. Creatinine now up to 3.9 post-op; UOP
   dwindling
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Gentle hydration with blood products/fluids
   - Hold torsemide
   -renal consult
   - Monitor for signs of uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, volume overload
   .
   # LEFT ARM/SHOULDER PAIN:  Patient may have injured LUE during fall
   he landed on his left side, but is unable to recall whether he had pain
   in his arm at that time. Limited internal/external rotation of L
   shoulder on exam.
   - Plain films of shoulder with no fracture or dislocation
   .
   # CHF - endstage. Difficult to titrate meds in setting of CKD. Weight
   baseline about 160, on [**4-6**] is 167 lb, had been stable throughout last
   week in rehab.
   - Daily weights
   - Hold torsemide 40 [**Hospital1 7**] given elevated creatinine
   - Hold spironolactone for now in setting of hyperkalemia
   - Continue BB
   - discuss restarting ASA
   - Continue statin
   - Goal UOP > 30 cc/hr
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: Possibly secondary to hemolysis post-transfusions.
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   - hold spironolactone
   - consider restart torsemide
   - give dose of kayexcelate
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS: Adrenal mass seen on CT this admission (8x6.2
   cm). Non-urgent adrenal MRI recommended by radiology for further
   characterization. Not evident on prior MRI [**2-7**], but ""Large but poorly
   assessed hypoechoic area (4 cm) in the region of the left upper pole,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 87-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with a left intertrochanteric fracture and hypotension. He has a history of diastolic CHF, AFib, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN. His current vital signs are:

* Tmax: 36.6°C
* Tcurrent: 35.9°C
* HR: 82 bpm
* BP: 107/70 mmHg
* RR: 21 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 96%

The patient has been experiencing poor urine output (<10cc/hr), and has received 1250cc of fluid and 1 unit of PRBC. His creatinine is trending up, and his Hct has decreased from 29.7 to 22.9.

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Alert and oriented
* Sclera anicteric
* Normal sensation and distal pulses in the left leg
* Soft, non-tender, non-distended abdomen
* Normal bowel sounds
* Foley catheter in place

The patient's lab results are:

* WBC: 8.2-9.5 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 22.8-28.0%
* Plt: 128-131 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 2.4-3.9 mg/dL
* TCO2: 25 mmHg
* Glucose: 60-106 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* CHF (end-stage)
* CKD (stage IV)
* AFib
* Mild AS
* HTN
* Chronic anemia
* Chronic venous stasis
* Recurrent C. Diff infection
* Thrombocytopenia
* Possible pneumonia
* Adrenal mass

The patient's plan includes:

* Gentle IVF or PRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90
* Hold ASA for now given low Hct
* Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of fracture
* Monitor for signs of complications (soft tissue hematoma, retroperitoneal bleed)
* Continue BB
* Enoxaparin SQ 30mg Q24
* Monitor for signs of uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, volume overload
* Hold torsemide
* Renal consult

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Hypovolemic shock
* Septic shock
* Cardiogenic shock
* Adrenal insufficiency
* Uremia
* Hyperkalemia
* Acidosis
* Volume overload
* Pneumonia
* C. Diff infection

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and has been receiving morphine sulfate for pain control. The patient's labs show a white blood cell count of 8.7 g/dL, hemoglobin of 121 K/uL, and platelet count of 128 K/uL. The patient's creatinine is trending up, and the patient has hyperkalemia.

The patient has an adrenal mass incidentally noted on imaging, which will require further evaluation once the patient's acute issues are resolved. The patient has a DVT prophylaxis in place and is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of renal failure: The patient's creatinine is trending up, and the patient is at risk for further kidney damage.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a history of poor urine output and is at risk for developing sepsis.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and is at risk for developing respiratory failure.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient has a history of blood loss and is at risk for further bleeding complications.
6. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has an adrenal mass incidentally noted on imaging, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
7. DVT: The patient is at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and other factors.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis, but is at risk for developing stress ulcers due to the patient's underlying condition.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust the treatment plan as necessary to prevent these potential complications from arising."
