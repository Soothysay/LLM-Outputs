You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of CAD, DM, and lung adenocarcinoma s/p lobectomy, who is currently admitted to the ICU with dyspnea and ARF. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 152/39 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 97%. The patient's respiratory support is stable, with no signs of respiratory distress. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, and the CXR is concerning for aspiration pneumonia versus improperly treated HAP. The patient has not been compliant with a pureed diet, and there is a concern for mucus plugging and atelectasis. 

The patient's medication list includes Vanco/Zosyn, flagyl, and IV morphine, which was given for pain management. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she has a confirmed DNR/DNI order with her son. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, and there is a risk of respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia, mucus plugging, and atelectasis.
2. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a history of CAD, and her current condition may lead to cardiovascular instability.
3. Infection: The patient has a high risk of infection due to her immunocompromised state and the presence of leukocytosis.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated, and there is a risk of hypernatremia if not managed properly.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and there is a risk of hypotension if not managed properly.
6. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk of developing a pulmonary embolism due to her immobility and the presence of DVT prophylaxis.
7. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to her immunocompromised state and the presence of infection.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely and adjusting her treatment plan accordingly. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and her oxygen therapy should be adjusted as needed. The patient's medication list should be reviewed and adjusted as necessary to ensure that she is receiving appropriate treatment for her condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   p/w dyspnea and ARF
   24 Hour Events:
   having dyspnea on FM 50% and 6 L NC.  She desaturated to 75% on that
   regimen.  She was placed on a non-rebreather and her Sats increased to
   100%.    Her EKG strip at that time had frequent PVCs.
   She was placed back on FM but O2 sats dropped to 90-91% and she was put
   back on FT
   Also patient appears to be very anxious and states that she feels like
   she is dying, and then when you ask her what
s wrong she asks for
   blanket.
   Patient states takes vicodin for vertebral compression fxs.  Gave her 1
   IV morphine with good response.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are noted:

**Summary:**

The patient, a 90-year-old female with a history of CAD, DM, and lung adenocarcinoma s/p lobectomy, is admitted to the ICU with dyspnea and acute respiratory failure (ARF). She has been treated with oxygen therapy, non-rebreather mask, and IV morphine for pain and anxiety. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, and her CXR reveals a persistent right lower lobe effusion with fluffy opacities in the left lower lobe. She has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia versus improperly treated hospital-acquired pneumonia, and further cardiac workup has been deferred.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's CXR shows a persistent right lower lobe effusion, which may be a sign of aspiration pneumonia. This could lead to further respiratory compromise and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient's leukocytosis and CXR findings suggest that she may have HAP, which could lead to further respiratory failure and sepsis.
3. Mucus Plugging and Atelectasis: The patient's respiratory status is likely to be compromised due to mucus plugging and atelectasis, which could further exacerbate her respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CAD and recent unremarkable adenosine MIBI scan may indicate cardiac compromise, which could lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's serum sodium level is elevated, which could lead to further complications, such as seizures, coma, or even death.
6. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate AKI, which could lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, or even death.
7. Skin Complications: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer may become infected, leading to further complications, such as sepsis or osteomyelitis.
8. Pseudomonas Infection: The patient's sputum culture shows Gram-negative rods, which may indicate a pseudomonas infection, which could lead to further respiratory failure and sepsis.

**Plan:**

1. Continue oxygen therapy and non-rebreather mask as needed.
2. Continue antibiotics and antifungals as prescribed.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider repeat CXR and CT chest if concerns persist.
4. Wean oxygen therapy as tolerated, but be prepared to increase oxygen support if necessary.
5. Consider thoracentesis if the patient's respiratory status does not improve.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider further treatment for hypernatremia.
7. Monitor the patient's creatinine level and consider further treatment for AKI.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's skin and consider further treatment for the sacral decubitus ulcer.
9. Consider further cardiac workup if the patient's cardiac status worsens.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's pain and anxiety levels and consider further treatment as needed."

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of lung cancer and previous resection. She was admitted to the hospital with hypoxemia and hypotension, and was later transferred to the ICU. She has a right-sided effusion and left lower lobe patchy opacities on her chest X-ray. Her laboratory results show an increased white blood cell count, indicating infection. She has a persistent pulmonary infection and pleural effusion, and her oxygen saturation is 95% on high-flow nebulization.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's persistent hypoxemia and hypotension may lead to pulmonary edema, which could worsen her respiratory status.
2. Sepsis: The patient's infection and hypotension make her at risk for sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ failure.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic lung disease and persistent pulmonary infection may lead to respiratory failure, which could require mechanical ventilation.
4. Pleural Effusion: The patient's right-sided effusion may continue to worsen, leading to respiratory compromise and potential need for thoracentesis.
5. Infection Progression: The patient's persistent infection may progress, leading to further complications such as bacteremia or septic shock.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension and potential sepsis may lead to cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's sepsis and potential multi-organ failure may lead to neurological complications such as encephalopathy or seizures.

Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics to cover hospital-acquired organisms.
2. Perform thoracentesis to drain the right-sided effusion and obtain diagnostic samples.
3. Monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and adjust her oxygen therapy as needed.
4. Continue IV fluids and monitor her blood pressure.
5. Consult with pulmonology and infectious disease specialists for further management.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her respiratory therapy as needed.
7. Consider mechanical ventilation if the patient's respiratory status worsens.
8. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust her medication regimen as needed.
9. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust her medication regimen as needed.
10. Follow up with the patient's family and caregivers to ensure they are aware of her condition and treatment plan."

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of CAD, DM, and lung adenocarcinoma s/p lobectomy, admitted to the ICU with dyspnea and ARF. She has received two boluses of MAPs and is currently receiving morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, and other medications. Her vital signs are stable, but she has shown signs of volume depletion, hypernatremia, and hypertension. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, and elevated liver enzymes. Chest X-ray shows moderate-sized right and small left pleural effusions, and imaging suggests early overhydration.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's dyspnea and ARF, combined with her history of lung adenocarcinoma, increase her risk of aspiration pneumonia.
2. Improperly treated HAP: The patient's leukocytosis and CXR findings suggest that she may have pneumonia, which could be improperly treated if not addressed promptly.
3. Mucus plugging and atelectasis: The patient's respiratory status and CXR findings suggest that she may have mucus plugging and atelectasis, which could worsen her respiratory status.
4. Volume depletion: The patient's signs of volume depletion, including decreased urine output and increased blood pressure, require close monitoring and treatment.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent further complications.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent further complications.
7. Pseudomonas infection: The patient's sputum culture shows multiple organisms consistent with oropharyngeal flora, which increases her risk of pseudomonas infection.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CAD and DM increases her risk of cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias and heart failure.
9. Renal complications: The patient's history of CKD and DM increases her risk of renal complications, including acute kidney injury and electrolyte imbalances.
10. Skin complications: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer and history of skin breakdown increase her risk of skin complications, including infection and further breakdown.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Administer antibiotics as prescribed and continue to monitor for signs of infection.
3. Manage the patient's volume depletion with IV fluids and monitor her urine output and blood pressure.
4. Monitor the patient's hypernatremia and adjust her fluid therapy as needed.
5. Manage the patient's hypertension with medication and monitor her blood pressure.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her fluid therapy as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's skin status and provide routine wound care.
8. Consider a CT chest if the patient's respiratory status does not improve.
9. Consider thoracentesis if the patient's respiratory status does not improve.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust her medication as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following key points:

1. The patient is a 90+ year-old female with a history of CAD, DM, and lung adenocarcinoma s/p lobectomy, currently admitted to the ICU for dyspnea and acute respiratory failure (ARF).
2. The patient received two 500mL boluses for systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the 90s and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the high 50s, with good response.
3. The patient developed tachycardia this morning, which was not responsive to fluids, and her blood pressure (BP) dropped after receiving trazadone for sleep.
4. The patient's respiratory status worsened this morning, with decreased breath sounds in the right base and a possible right lung effusion.
5. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and hypernatremia, which may be related to her underlying kidney disease.
6. The patient's imaging studies show moderate-sized right and small left pleural effusions, with persistent hazy opacification at the left base, which may be due to atelectasis or pneumonia.
7. The patient's microbiology results show a Gram-negative rod on sputum Gram stain, which is consistent with oropharyngeal flora.
8. The patient's plan includes giving Lasix to improve her respiratory status, obtaining further blood, sputum, and urine cultures, and considering thoracentesis if her respiratory status does not improve.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia, given the patient's history of lung adenocarcinoma and respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications, such as tachycardia, due to her underlying CAD and lung disease.
3. Respiratory failure, which may worsen if the patient's respiratory status does not improve.
4. Infection, given the patient's leukocytosis and positive Gram stain on sputum.
5. Hypernatremia, which may lead to complications such as seizures, coma, or death if not addressed.
6. Hypertension, which may worsen the patient's cardiovascular status.
7. Skin breakdown, given the patient's age and immobility.
8. Wound complications, given the patient's history of compression fractures and sacral decubitus.

Based on this assessment, I recommend that the patient's plan of care should include close monitoring of her respiratory status, cardiovascular function, and electrolyte levels, as well as further evaluation and treatment of her underlying infections and medical conditions."

   evolved some significant tachycardia and respiratory distress this

   edema in the setting of baseline pulmonary compromise.
   Respiratory Distress-
   Pneumonia--Vanco/Zosyn to continue
                    --Continue with chest PT and mobilization of
   secretions
   Pulmonary Edema--That may be playing a role in the current respiratory
   distress and will have to move to diuresis this morning to look for
   response
                   --Lasix IV this morning
                   --Will have to consider CPAP if response limited.
   Acute Renal Failure-
                  --Likely pre-renal and has improved significantly with
   hydration which may be mildly exessive at this time.
   Hypertension-
                 --Return B-Blocker today for BP and HR control
   Back Pain-

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo female with history of LLL resection for lung CA who now has
   evolved some significant tachycardia and respiratory distress this
   morning with evolution of significant respiratory distress which at
   this point may well represent some significant evolution of pulmonary
   edema in the setting of baseline pulmonary compromise.
   Respiratory Distress-
   Pneumonia--Vanco/Zosyn to continue
                    --Continue with chest PT and mobilization of
   secretions
   Pulmonary Edema--That may be playing a role in the current respiratory
   distress and will have to move to diuresis this morning to look for
   response
                   --Lasix IV this morning
                   --Will have to consider CPAP if response limited.
   Acute Renal Failure-
                  --Likely pre-renal and has improved significantly with
   hydration which may be mildly exessive at this time.
   Hypertension-
                 --Return B-Blocker today for BP and HR control

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90+ year-old female with a history of lung cancer and has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* Heart rate: 118 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 120/72 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 33 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 91%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient has undergone several interventions, including:

* Administration of antibiotics (Metronidazole and Piperacillin/Tazobactam)
* Infusion of heparin sodium for prophylaxis
* Fluid boluses without change in hemodynamics
* Use of an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: No acute distress
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and distant S2 heart sounds
* Respiratory: Diminished breath sounds on the right base
* Abdominal: Soft
* Extremities: Warm and 1+ edema in both legs
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, but movement, tone, and reflexes are not assessed

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.5 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 12.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 257 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 23 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Na+: 114 mEq/L, K+: 3.5 mEq/L, Cl-: 36.9%
* Calcium: 8.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 1.5 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan are as follows:

* Respiratory distress: Continue antibiotics, chest physical therapy, and mobilization of secretions. Consider CPAP if response is limited.
* Pulmonary edema: Start diuresis with Lasix IV to look for response.
* Acute renal failure: Continue hydration and consider CPAP if response is limited.
* Hypertension: Restart beta-blocker for BP and HR control.
* Back pain: Administer Vicodin for pain control and provide wound care for decubitus ulcer.

The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of lung cancer and recent LLL resection. She is currently in the ICU with significant tachycardia and respiratory distress, which may be related to pulmonary edema in the setting of baseline pulmonary compromise.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* Heart rate: 118 bpm
* Blood pressure: 120/72 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 33 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 91%
* Hemodynamic monitoring shows mild hypotension.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.5 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 38.7%
* Platelet count: 257 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 23 mg/dL
* Glucose: 113 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Acute renal failure (likely pre-renal)
* Hypertension
* Pulmonary edema (may be playing a role in current respiratory distress)
* Back pain (managed with Vicodin)
* Decubitus ulcer (managed with wound care)

The patient's medications include:

* Metronidazole and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) for pneumonia
* Heparin sodium (prophylaxis) for DVT
* Lasix IV for pulmonary edema
* Regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control
* B-blocker for hypertension control
* Vicodin for pain control

The patient's respiratory support includes:

* Aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device
* Chest physiotherapy and mobilization of secretions

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of pulmonary edema
* Decreased oxygen saturation
* Increased risk of respiratory failure
* Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias
* Increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy
* Increased risk of wound infection due to decubitus ulcer
* Increased risk of sepsis due to pneumonia
* Increased risk of acute kidney injury due to hypotension and dehydration

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to ensure early detection and management of potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of CAD, DM, and lung adenocarcinoma, who was admitted with aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She has been experiencing respiratory distress, tachycardia, and hypernatremia. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, and kidney dysfunction. She is currently receiving antibiotics, diuretics, and respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and she may require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and laboratory results suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and tachycardia may increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
4. Renal failure: The patient's kidney dysfunction and hypernatremia may worsen, requiring further management and possibly dialysis.
5. Skin complications: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer may worsen, requiring further wound care and management.
6. Infection: The patient's PNA and possible HAP may lead to secondary infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's respiratory distress and tachycardia may lead to neurological complications, such as altered mental status or seizures.
8. Nutritional complications: The patient's inability to take oral medications and her requirement for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may lead to nutritional deficiencies and complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue respiratory support and monitor the patient's respiratory status closely.
2. Administer antibiotics and diuretics as prescribed, and monitor the patient's response to treatment.
3. Monitor the patient's laboratory results, including kidney function and electrolyte levels, and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Manage the patient's pain and anxiety with medications and other interventions as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's skin and wound care, and consider further management if necessary.
6. Consider further imaging studies, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan, to evaluate the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status.
7. Monitor the patient's neurological status and consider further evaluation if necessary.
8. Consider further nutritional support, such as enteral nutrition, if the patient is unable to tolerate oral medications or TPN."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female admitted to the ICU with an unresponsive status. She has a history of allergies to codeine, acetaminophen, caffeine, and butalbital. She has been receiving antibiotics, including metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam, and vancomycin. She is also receiving infusions of morphine sulfate and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.3°C (97.3°F)
* Heart rate: 115 bpm (101-124 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 78/38 mmHg (48-150/105 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 9 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 67%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 12.6 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 8.5 K/uL
* Platelet count: 257 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Glucose: 113 mg/dL
* Other lab results include PT/PTT/INR, differential count, and electrolyte levels.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to her unresponsive status. She is unable to provide a history, and her peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems are not assessed.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Continued support at CMO status with family discussion and patient wishes
* Current nutrition and glycemic control
* Maintenance of lines and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* Code status: DNR/DNI
* Disposition: ICU care

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis due to the patient's antibiotics and uncontrolled infection
* Respiratory failure due to her low SpO2 and respiratory rate
* Cardiac complications due to her tachycardia and hypotension
* Renal failure due to her elevated creatinine levels
* Electrolyte imbalance due to her laboratory results
* Wound infections or pressure ulcers due to her immobility
* Catheter-related complications due to her multiple lines
* Pulmonary embolism due to her DVT prophylaxis
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to her stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to her respiratory support."
