   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 84 yo F h/o dementia, htn, tia presenting with 10 lb weight
   gain and new lower extremity edema transferred to the CCU for
   hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   .
   # Acute right-sided heart failure: Patient significantly volume
   overloaded on exam and as evidenced by CXR.  Echo today demonstrated
   preserved EF but new severe RV dilatation consistent with RV
   pressure/volume overload.   The etiology of this RV dilatation is
   unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] pts immobility and age PE is high on the differential.
   Unable to obtain a CTA due to renal function but echo findings could be
   consistent with PE.  She is hypoxic, but not tachycardic, which argues
   against PE. Although EKG on this admission has Q-wave changes there are
   no ST abnormalities and while elevated troponins certainly are
   concerning for ACS this elevation is most like related to her heart
   failure exacerbation.  Q waves may represent recent ischemic event
   causing R heart failure. Finally, she may have another cause of
   pulmonary HTN either subacute or chronic such as intrinsic pulmonary
   disease.  Pt received 80mg IV lasix and diuresed nearly 1L in an 1 hr.
   - Gentle diuresis with lasix ggt with a goal of approximately 1L given
   patient is significantly preload dependent.
   - Empiric treatment for PE with heparin given clinical picture and echo
   findings.  Positive D-dimer not helpful in this setting.
   - Lower extremity U/S revelead no DVT in either leg
   - CTA in the near future given unclear etiology of heart failure
   exacerbation and once renal function has improved.
   - repeat ECG in AM
   - cont to trend CEs
   - Daily weights
   - Repeat CXR in the AM
   -Patient needs better access will get a PICC line today if pt allows it
   # Confusion/Lethargy: Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] level of
   consciousness as well as intermittent disorientation.  Differential
   includes worsening of baseline dementia (less likely give
   waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 226**]) vs acute delirium.  Possible causes of delirium in this
   elderly woman include infection, toxic/metabolic, medications.
   Possible medication culprits include remeron (recently satrted).
   Regarding toxic/metabolic, glucose has been widely fluctuating but
   currently WNL, electrolytes WNL, TSH WNL, BUN elevated but not frankly
   uremic level, patient not currently hypoxic.  Basic infectious w/u
   including blood/urine cx, CXR, without evidence of source.
   - continue to monitor mental status
   - f/u blood and urine cx
   - hold Remeron
   - avoid psycotropic medications as much as possible
   - evaluate and treat underlying medical issues
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.9 now 1.4.  Likely
   secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of CHF.
   - diuresis as per above
   - trend BUN/Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - renally dose all meds
   - replete K+ given patient on lasix
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was initially hypoxic on the floor despite 4L NC,
   but improved significantly with diuresis. Likely contributing is her
   pulmonary edema (given CXR findings) which may be [**12-27**] RV dilatation
   causing LV impingement with functional constrictive physiology and
   impaired L-sided filling.  Other possible contributing factors include
   PE.  Also on the differential would be patent PFO with reversal to
   R-->L shunting in the setting of high pulmonary pressure (although
   prior echo - ? if bubble study - commented on lack of PFO).
   - continue to monitor O2 sats and wean O2 as tolerated to keep sats>94%
   - continue to diurese as tolerated
   - continue empiric treatment of PE and consider further eval as above
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue outpt regimen of synthroid
   .
   # Anorexia:  Daughter and HCP report declining ability to take PO.
   Possibly [**12-27**] worsening dementia vs subacute medical illness.  Remeron
   recently started for this, unclear if this had been helpful.
   - holding remeron given ? AMS possibly related

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of dementia, hypertension, and TIA, who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including:

1. Acute right-sided heart failure: The patient has significant volume overload, as evidenced by her CXR and echocardiogram, which shows preserved EF but new severe RV dilatation consistent with RV pressure/volume overload.
2. Confusion/Lethargy: The patient has a waxing and waning level of consciousness, with intermittent disorientation, which may be related to worsening of her baseline dementia or acute delirium.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine was 0.9, which has now increased to 1.4, likely secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of CHF.
4. Hypoxia: The patient was initially hypoxic on the floor, but improved significantly with diuresis. The etiology of her hypoxia is unclear, but may be related to pulmonary edema, PE, or patent PFO.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is currently taking synthroid.

The patient's medical complications are being managed with the following treatments:

1. Lasix: The patient received 80mg IV lasix and diuresed nearly 1L in an hour. Gentle diuresis with lasix is planned with a goal of approximately 1L given the patient's significant preload dependence.
2. Heparin: The patient is receiving empiric treatment for PE with heparin, given her clinical picture and echo findings.
3. Repeat ECG: The patient will have a repeat ECG in the morning to monitor her cardiac status.
4. Trend CEs: The patient's CEs will be trended daily to monitor her cardiac function.
5. Daily weights: The patient will have daily weights to monitor her fluid status.
6. Repeat CXR: The patient will have a repeat CXR in the morning to monitor her pulmonary status.
7. PICC line: The patient will have a PICC line inserted today if she allows it.
8. Hold Remeron: The patient's Remeron will be held due to her altered mental status.
9. Avoid psycotropic medications: The patient will be avoided psycotropic medications as much as possible.
10. Evaluate and treat underlying medical issues: The patient's underlying medical issues will be evaluated and treated to address her confusion, lethargy, and other symptoms.

The patient's care plan includes:

1. Continue to monitor mental status.
2. Follow up blood and urine cultures.
3. Trend BUN/Cr.
4. Avoid nephrotoxic agents.
5. Renally dose all medications.
6. Replete K+ given the patient's use of lasix.
7. Continue to diurese as tolerated.
8. Continue empiric treatment of PE.
9. Consider further evaluation, including a CTA, once the patient's renal function has improved.

The patient's family has been informed of her condition and treatment plan, and the patient's code status has been confirmed as full code."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 84 yo F h/o dementia, htn, tia presenting with 10 lb weight
   gain and new lower extremity edema transferred to the CCU for
   hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   .
   # Acute right-sided heart failure: Patient significantly volume
   overloaded on exam and as evidenced by CXR.  Echo today demonstrated
   preserved EF but new severe RV dilatation consistent with RV
   pressure/volume overload.   The etiology of this RV dilatation is
   unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] pts immobility and age PE is high on the differential.
   Unable to obtain a CTA due to renal function but echo findings could be
   consistent with PE.  She is hypoxic, but not tachycardic, which argues
   against PE. Although EKG on this admission has Q-wave changes there are
   no ST abnormalities and while elevated troponins certainly are
   concerning for ACS this elevation is most like related to her heart
   failure exacerbation.  Q waves may represent recent ischemic event
   causing R heart failure. Finally, she may have another cause of
   pulmonary HTN either subacute or chronic such as intrinsic pulmonary
   disease.  Pt received 80mg IV lasix and diuresed nearly 1L in an 1 hr.
   - Gentle diuresis with lasix ggt with a goal of approximately 1L given
   patient is significantly preload dependent.
   - Continue treatment with Heparin .  ? Warfarin bridge
   - Renal function at 1.4 Cr. ?CTA in the near future given unclear
   etiology of heart failure exacerbation
   - Daily weights
   -Patient needs better access will get a PICC line today if pt allows it
   # Confusion/Lethargy: Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] level of
   consciousness as well as intermittent disorientation.  Differential
   includes worsening of baseline dementia (less likely give
   waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 226**]) vs acute delirium.  Possible causes of delirium in this
   elderly woman include infection, toxic/metabolic, medications.
   Possible medication culprits include remeron (recently satrted).
   Regarding toxic/metabolic, glucose has been widely fluctuating but
   currently WNL, electrolytes WNL, TSH WNL, BUN elevated but not frankly
   uremic level, patient not currently hypoxic.  Basic infectious w/u
   including blood/urine cx, CXR, without evidence of source.
   - Mental status improved this AM
   - f/u blood cx
   - urine cx no growth
   - hold Remeron
   - avoid psycotropic medications as much as possible
   - evaluate and treat underlying medical issues
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.9 still 1.4.  Likely
   secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of CHF.
   - diuresis as per above
   - trend BUN/Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - renally dose all meds
   - replete K+ given patient on lasix
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was initially hypoxic on the floor despite 4L NC,
   but improved significantly with diuresis. Likely contributing is her
   pulmonary edema (given CXR findings) which may be [**12-27**] RV dilatation
   causing LV impingement with functional constrictive physiology and
   impaired L-sided filling.  Other possible contributing factors include
   PE.  Also on the differential would be patent PFO with reversal to
   R-->L shunting in the setting of high pulmonary pressure (although
   prior echo - ? if bubble study - commented on lack of PFO).
   - Pt on room air  satting well.
   - continue to diurese as tolerated
   - continue empiric treatment of PE and consider further eval as above
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue outpt regimen of synthroid
   .
   # Anorexia:  Daughter and HCP report declining ability to take PO.
   Possibly [**12-27**] worsening dementia vs subacute medical illness.  Remeron
   recently started for this, unclear if this had been helpful.
   - Poor PO intake will follow nutrition

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Acute Right-Sided Heart Failure: The patient's severe RV dilatation and pulmonary edema may lead to further deterioration in cardiac function, increasing the risk of cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and death.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 1.4, and the patient is at risk of further renal deterioration due to poor forward flow in the setting of CHF. This may lead to further electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and need for dialysis.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may worsen due to continued pulmonary edema, RV dilatation, and potential PE. This may lead to respiratory failure, ARDS, and death.
4. Confusion/Lethargy: The patient's mental status may continue to deteriorate due to worsening dementia, acute delirium, or underlying medical issues. This may lead to further complications, such as falls, aspiration, and poor nutrition.
5. Infection: The patient's baseline dementia and immobility make them susceptible to infections, which may worsen their condition and lead to further complications.
6. Thromboembolic Events: The patient's immobility and age make them at high risk for thromboembolic events, such as DVT and PE, which may worsen their condition and lead to further complications.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's lasix use may lead to electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia, which may worsen their cardiac function and increase the risk of arrhythmias.
8. Anorexia: The patient's poor PO intake may lead to malnutrition, which may worsen their overall condition and increase the risk of further complications.

To mitigate these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their cardiac, renal, respiratory, and metabolic functions. This includes continued diuresis with lasix, anticoagulation therapy, and management of electrolyte imbalances. The patient also requires further evaluation and treatment of their underlying medical issues, including potential PE, RV dilatation, and hypothyroidism."

   This is an 84 yo F h/o dementia, htn, tia presenting with 10 lb weight
   gain and new lower extremity edema transferred to the CCU for
   hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   .
   # Acute right-sided heart failure: Patient significantly volume
   overloaded on exam and as evidenced by CXR.  Echo today demonstrated
   preserved EF but new severe RV dilatation consistent with RV
   pressure/volume overload.   The etiology of this RV dilatation is
   unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] pts immobility and age PE is high on the differential.
   Unable to obtain a CTA due to renal function but echo findings could be
   consistent with PE.  She is hypoxic, but not tachycardic, which argues
   against PE. Although EKG on this admission has Q-wave changes there are
   no ST abnormalities and while elevated troponins certainly are
   concerning for ACS this elevation is most like related to her heart
   failure exacerbation.  Q waves may represent recent ischemic event
   causing R heart failure. Finally, she may have another cause of
   pulmonary HTN either subacute or chronic such as intrinsic pulmonary
   disease.  Pt received 80mg IV lasix and diuresed nearly 1L in an 1 hr.

   # Confusion/Lethargy: Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] level of
   consciousness as well as intermittent disorientation.  Differential
   includes worsening of baseline dementia (less likely give
   waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 226**]) vs acute delirium.  Possible causes of delirium in this
   elderly woman include infection, toxic/metabolic, medications.
   Possible medication culprits include remeron (recently satrted).
   Regarding toxic/metabolic, glucose has been widely fluctuating but
   currently WNL, electrolytes WNL, TSH WNL, BUN elevated but not frankly
   uremic level, patient not currently hypoxic.  Basic infectious w/u
   including blood/urine cx, CXR, without evidence of source.

   secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of CHF.
   - diuresis as per above
   - trend BUN/Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - renally dose all meds
   - replete K+ given patient on lasix
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was initially hypoxic on the floor despite 4L NC,
   but improved significantly with diuresis. Likely contributing is her
   pulmonary edema (given CXR findings) which may be [**12-27**] RV dilatation
   causing LV impingement with functional constrictive physiology and
   impaired L-sided filling.  Other possible contributing factors include
   PE.  Also on the differential would be patent PFO with reversal to
   R-->L shunting in the setting of high pulmonary pressure (although
   prior echo - ? if bubble study - commented on lack of PFO).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of dementia, hypertension, and TIA, who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status. She has been diagnosed with acute right-sided heart failure, likely secondary to volume overload, and is being treated with diuresis and anticoagulation. She also has acute renal failure, hypoxia, and anorexia, and is being evaluated for possible causes of delirium. The patient is receiving treatment for her conditions, including diuresis, anticoagulation, and antibiotics, and is being monitored closely for any changes in her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia and respiratory distress may lead to respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by her underlying heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
2. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and hypotension may be indicative of sepsis, which could be caused by a variety of factors, including pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or other infections.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's acute right-sided heart failure and hypotension may increase her risk of cardiac arrest, particularly if her heart failure worsens or if she develops a cardiac arrhythmia.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if she continues to experience hypotension, heart failure, or other factors that reduce blood flow to her kidneys.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's anorexia and poor nutrition may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly if she develops a bleeding ulcer or other gastrointestinal complications.
6. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's immobility and poor nutrition may increase her risk of developing pressure ulcers, particularly if she is not turned regularly or if her skin is not properly cared for.
7. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and hypotension may increase her risk of developing an infection, particularly if she has a compromised immune system or if she is not receiving proper wound care.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   # Acute right-sided heart failure: Patient significantly volume
   overloaded on exam and as evidenced by CXR.  Echo today demonstrated
   preserved EF but new severe RV dilatation consistent with RV
   pressure/volume overload.   The etiology of this RV dilatation is
   unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] pts immobility and age PE is high on the differential.
   Unable to obtain a CTA due to renal function but echo findings could be
   consistent with PE.  She is hypoxic, but not tachycardic, which argues
   against PE. Although EKG on this admission has Q-wave changes there are
   no ST abnormalities and while elevated troponins certainly are
   concerning for ACS this elevation is most like related to her heart
   failure exacerbation.  Q waves may represent recent ischemic event
   causing R heart failure. Finally, she may have another cause of
   pulmonary HTN either subacute or chronic such as intrinsic pulmonary
   disease.  Pt received 80mg IV lasix and diuresed nearly 1L in an 1 hr.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   gain and new lower extremity edema transferred to the CCU for
   hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   .
   # Acute right-sided heart failure: Patient significantly volume
   overloaded on exam and as evidenced by CXR.  Echo today demonstrated
   preserved EF but new severe RV dilatation consistent with RV
   pressure/volume overload.   The etiology of this RV dilatation is
   unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] pts immobility and age PE is high on the differential.
   Unable to obtain a CTA due to renal function but echo findings could be
   consistent with PE.  She is hypoxic, but not tachycardic, which argues
   against PE. Although EKG on this admission has Q-wave changes there are
   no ST abnormalities and while elevated troponins certainly are
   concerning for ACS this elevation is most like related to her heart
   failure exacerbation.  Q waves may represent recent ischemic event
   causing R heart failure. Finally, she may have another cause of
   pulmonary HTN either subacute or chronic such as intrinsic pulmonary
   disease.  Pt received 80mg IV lasix and diuresed nearly 1L in an 1 hr.
   - CTA today to evaluate for possible PE
   - Gentle diuresis with lasix bolus
   - Continue treatment with Heparin .  ? Warfarin bridge
   - Renal function at 1.4 Cr. ?CTA in the near future given unclear
   etiology of heart failure exacerbation
   - Daily weights
   -Patient needs better access will get a PICC line today if pt allows it
   # Confusion/Lethargy: Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] level of
   consciousness as well as intermittent disorientation.  Differential
   includes worsening of baseline dementia (less likely give
   waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 226**]) vs acute delirium.  Possible causes of delirium in this
   elderly woman include infection, toxic/metabolic, medications.
   Possible medication culprits include remeron (recently satrted).
   Regarding toxic/metabolic, glucose has been widely fluctuating but
   currently WNL, electrolytes WNL, TSH WNL, BUN elevated but not frankly
   uremic level, patient not currently hypoxic.  Basic infectious w/u
   including blood/urine cx, CXR, without evidence of source.
   - Mental status improved this AM
   - f/u blood cx
   - urine cx no growth
   - hold Remeron
   - avoid psycotropic medications as much as possible
   - evaluate and treat underlying medical issues
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.9 still 1.4.  Likely
   secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of CHF.
   - diuresis as per above
   - trend BUN/Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - renally dose all meds
   - replete K+ given patient on lasix
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was initially hypoxic on the floor despite 4L NC,
   but improved significantly with diuresis. Likely contributing is her
   pulmonary edema (given CXR findings) which may be [**12-27**] RV dilatation
   causing LV impingement with functional constrictive physiology and
   impaired L-sided filling.  Other possible contributing factors include
   PE.  Also on the differential would be patent PFO with reversal to
   R-->L shunting in the setting of high pulmonary pressure (although
   prior echo - ? if bubble study - commented on lack of PFO).
   - Pt on room air  satting well.
   - continue to diurese as tolerated
   - continue empiric treatment of PE and consider further eval as above
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue outpt regimen of synthroid
   .
   # Anorexia:  Daughter and HCP report declining ability to take PO.
   Possibly [**12-27**] worsening dementia vs subacute medical illness.  Remeron
   recently started for this, unclear if this had been helpful.
   - Poor PO intake will follow nutrition

   - holding remeron given ? AMS possibly related
   - encouraged supervised eating
   - nutrition consult today since mental status has improved
   - Speech and swallow evaluation given her dementia and risk for

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Acute right-sided heart failure: The patient's volume overload, as evidenced by CXR and echo findings, can lead to further cardiac complications, such as pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and decreased cardiac output.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The unclear etiology of the patient's RV dilatation and the presence of Q-wave changes on EKG, along with elevated troponins, raise concerns about PE. Further evaluation with CTA is necessary to rule out this possibility.
3. Confusion and delirium: The patient's waxing and waning level of consciousness, as well as intermittent disorientation, may be related to worsening dementia, acute delirium, or underlying medical issues such as infection, toxic/metabolic, or medications.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine of 0.9 has increased to 1.4, likely secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of CHF. Diuresis and close monitoring of BUN/Cr are necessary to prevent further decline.
5. Hypoxia: The patient's initial hypoxia on the floor, which improved with diuresis, may be related to pulmonary edema, RV dilatation, or PE. Continuous monitoring and diuresis are necessary to prevent further hypoxia.
6. Anorexia: The patient's declining ability to take PO may be related to worsening dementia or subacute medical illness. Nutrition consultation and speech and swallow evaluation are necessary to ensure adequate nutrition and prevent aspiration.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism requires continued outpatient regimen of synthroid.
8. Infectious complications: The patient's baseline dementia, age, and immobility make her susceptible to infectious complications, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections. Close monitoring and prompt treatment of any suspected infections are necessary.
9. Medication-related complications: The patient's use of lasix, remeron, and other medications may lead to adverse effects, such as electrolyte imbalances, bleeding, or gastrointestinal disturbances. Close monitoring and adjustments to medications are necessary to minimize these risks.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Diuresis with lasix to manage volume overload and hypoxia
2. Gentle diuresis with lasix bolus to reduce pulmonary edema
3. Continue treatment with Heparin and consider warfarin bridge to evaluate for PE
4. Renal function monitoring and adjustment of medications to avoid nephrotoxic agents
5. Nutrition consultation and speech and swallow evaluation to ensure adequate nutrition and prevent aspiration
6. Close monitoring of BUN/Cr and electrolyte levels
7. Continued outpatient regimen of synthroid for hypothyroidism
8. Holding remeron and avoiding psychotropic medications to minimize the risk of delirium and confusion
9. Further evaluation with CTA to rule out PE and determine the etiology of the patient's RV dilatation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 84 yo F h/o dementia, htn, tia presenting with 10 lb weight
   gain and new lower extremity edema transferred to the CCU for
   hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   .
   # Acute right-sided heart failure: Patient significantly volume
   overloaded on exam and as evidenced by CXR.  Echo today demonstrated
   preserved EF but new severe RV dilatation consistent with RV
   pressure/volume overload.   The etiology of this RV dilatation is
   unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] pts immobility and age PE is high on the differential.
   Unable to obtain a CTA due to renal function but echo findings could be
   consistent with PE.  She is hypoxic, but not tachycardic, which argues
   against PE. Although EKG on this admission has Q-wave changes there are
   no ST abnormalities and while elevated troponins certainly are
   concerning for ACS this elevation is most like related to her heart
   failure exacerbation.  Q waves may represent recent ischemic event
   causing R heart failure. Finally, she may have another cause of
   pulmonary HTN either subacute or chronic such as intrinsic pulmonary
   disease.  Pt received 80mg IV lasix and diuresed nearly 1L in an 1 hr.
   - CTA today to evaluate for possible PE
   - Gentle diuresis with lasix bolus
   - Continue treatment with Heparin .  ? Warfarin bridge
   - Renal function at 1.4 Cr.
   - Daily weights
   # Confusion/Lethargy: Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] level of
   consciousness as well as intermittent disorientation.  Differential
   includes worsening of baseline dementia (less likely give
   waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 226**]) vs acute delirium.  Possible causes of delirium in this
   elderly woman include infection, toxic/metabolic, medications.
   Possible medication culprits include remeron (recently satrted).
   Regarding toxic/metabolic, glucose has been widely fluctuating but
   currently WNL, electrolytes WNL, TSH WNL, BUN elevated but not frankly
   uremic level, patient not currently hypoxic.  Basic infectious w/u
   including blood/urine cx, CXR, without evidence of source.
   - Mental status improved this AM
   - f/u blood cx
   - urine cx no growth
   - hold Remeron
   - avoid psycotropic medications as much as possible
   - evaluate and treat underlying medical issues
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.9 still 1.4.  Likely
   secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of CHF.
   - diuresis as per above
   - trend BUN/Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - renally dose all meds
   - replete K+ given patient on lasix
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was initially hypoxic on the floor despite 4L NC,
   but improved significantly with diuresis. Likely contributing is her
   pulmonary edema (given CXR findings) which may be [**12-27**] RV dilatation
   causing LV impingement with functional constrictive physiology and
   impaired L-sided filling.  Other possible contributing factors include
   PE.  Also on the differential would be patent PFO with reversal to
   R-->L shunting in the setting of high pulmonary pressure (although
   prior echo - ? if bubble study - commented on lack of PFO).
   - Pt on room air  satting well.
   - continue to diurese as tolerated
   - continue empiric treatment of PE and consider further eval as above
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue outpt regimen of synthroid
   .
   # Anorexia:  Daughter and HCP report declining ability to take PO.
   Possibly [**12-27**] worsening dementia vs subacute medical illness.  Remeron
   recently started for this, unclear if this had been helpful.
   - Poor PO intake will follow nutrition

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of dementia, hypertension, and TIA, admitted to the ICU for hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status. She has been experiencing weight gain, new lower extremity edema, and decreased breath sounds at the bases. Her lab results show elevated troponins, and an echocardiogram revealed preserved EF but new severe RV dilatation consistent with RV pressure/volume overload. The patient was given lasix and diuresed nearly 1L in an hour. She has also been experiencing confusion and lethargy, which may be related to worsening dementia or acute delirium.

Potential medical complications:

1. Acute right-sided heart failure: The patient's volume overload and RV dilatation may lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure exacerbation or arrhythmias.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's hypoxia and RV dilatation may be related to PE, which could worsen her condition if left untreated.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine is 0.9, and her current creatinine is 1.4, indicating worsening renal function. This may be secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of CHF.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's thyroid function test results are not mentioned in the note, but her current medication regimen includes synthroid.
5. Anorexia: The patient's declining ability to take PO may be related to worsening dementia or subacute medical illness, which could lead to malnutrition and other complications.
6. Confusion and lethargy: The patient's altered mental status may be related to worsening dementia or acute delirium, which could worsen if left untreated.
7. Infection: The patient's basic infectious w/u has not revealed a source of infection, but her elevated BUN and creatinine levels may indicate underlying kidney disease or infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue diuresis with lasix as tolerated to manage the patient's volume overload and RV dilatation.
2. Consider further evaluation for PE, including a CTA, to rule out this potential complication.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust her medication regimen as necessary to manage her acute renal failure.
4. Continue to manage the patient's hypothyroidism with synthroid, and monitor her thyroid function test results to adjust her medication regimen as necessary.
5. Encourage the patient to eat and consider a nutrition consult to assess her nutritional needs.
6. Monitor the patient's mental status closely and consider further evaluation for delirium or dementia.
7. Consider a speech and swallow evaluation to assess the patient's risk for aspiration.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medication regimen as necessary to manage her electrolyte imbalances."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 84 yo F h/o dementia, htn, tia presenting with 10 lb weight
   gain and new lower extremity edema transferred to the CCU for
   hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status.
   .
   # Acute right-sided heart failure: Patient significantly volume
   overloaded on exam and as evidenced by CXR.  Echo today demonstrated
   preserved EF but new severe RV dilatation consistent with RV
   pressure/volume overload.   The etiology of this RV dilatation is
   unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] pts immobility and age PE is high on the differential.
   Unable to obtain a CTA due to renal function but echo findings could be
   consistent with PE.  She is hypoxic, but not tachycardic, which argues
   against PE. Although EKG on this admission has Q-wave changes there are
   no ST abnormalities and while elevated troponins certainly are
   concerning for ACS this elevation is most like related to her heart
   failure exacerbation.  Q waves may represent recent ischemic event
   causing R heart failure. Finally, she may have another cause of
   pulmonary HTN either subacute or chronic such as intrinsic pulmonary
   disease.  Pt received 80mg IV lasix and diuresed nearly 1L in an 1 hr.
   - Gentle diuresis with lasix ggt with a goal of approximately 1L given
   patient is significantly preload dependent.
   - Empiric treatment for PE with heparin given clinical picture and echo
   findings.  Positive D-dimer not helpful in this setting.
   - Lower extremity U/S revelead no DVT in either leg
   - CTA in the near future given unclear etiology of heart failure
   exacerbation and once renal function has improved.
   - repeat ECG in AM
   - cont to trend CEs
   - Daily weights
   - Repeat CXR in the AM
   -Patient needs better access will get a PICC line today if pt allows it
   # Confusion/Lethargy: Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] level of
   consciousness as well as intermittent disorientation.  Differential
   includes worsening of baseline dementia (less likely give
   waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 226**]) vs acute delirium.  Possible causes of delirium in this
   elderly woman include infection, toxic/metabolic, medications.
   Possible medication culprits include remeron (recently satrted).
   Regarding toxic/metabolic, glucose has been widely fluctuating but
   currently WNL, electrolytes WNL, TSH WNL, BUN elevated but not frankly
   uremic level, patient not currently hypoxic.  Basic infectious w/u
   including blood/urine cx, CXR, without evidence of source.
   - continue to monitor mental status
   - f/u blood and urine cx
   - hold Remeron
   - avoid psycotropic medications as much as possible
   - evaluate and treat underlying medical issues
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.9 now 1.4.  Likely
   secondary to poor forward flow in the setting of CHF.
   - diuresis as per above
   - trend BUN/Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - renally dose all meds
   - replete K+ given patient on lasix
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient was initially hypoxic on the floor despite 4L NC,
   but improved significantly with diuresis. Likely contributing is her
   pulmonary edema (given CXR findings) which may be [**12-27**] RV dilatation
   causing LV impingement with functional constrictive physiology and
   impaired L-sided filling.  Other possible contributing factors include
   PE.  Also on the differential would be patent PFO with reversal to
   R-->L shunting in the setting of high pulmonary pressure (although
   prior echo - ? if bubble study - commented on lack of PFO).
   - continue to monitor O2 sats and wean O2 as tolerated to keep sats>94%
   - continue to diurese as tolerated
   - continue empiric treatment of PE and consider further eval as above
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue outpt regimen of synthroid
   .
   # Anorexia:  Daughter and HCP report declining ability to take PO.
   Possibly [**12-27**] worsening dementia vs subacute medical illness.  Remeron
   recently started for this, unclear if this had been helpful.
   - holding remeron given ? AMS possibly related
   - encouraged supervised eating
   - nutrition consult once mental status closer to baseline
   .

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of dementia, hypertension, and TIA, who was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, hypoxia, and altered mental status. She has been experiencing 10-pound weight gain and new lower extremity edema. The patient has been diagnosed with acute right-sided heart failure, acute renal failure, hypoxia, and anorexia. She is receiving treatment for pulmonary embolism, and a PICC line is being ordered. The patient's mental status is fluctuating, and she is experiencing confusion and lethargy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute right-sided heart failure: The patient's condition is likely to worsen if not managed properly, leading to further fluid overload, decreased cardiac output, and potential organ dysfunction.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she is at risk for further kidney damage if not managed properly. This could lead to chronic kidney disease, electrolyte imbalances, and potential end-stage renal disease.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation levels are stable, but she is at risk for further desaturation if not managed properly. This could lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and potential death.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's clinical picture and echo findings are consistent with pulmonary embolism, and if not treated promptly, it could lead to further respiratory distress, cardiac arrest, and potential death.
5. Delirium: The patient's mental status is fluctuating, and she is at risk for further cognitive decline if not managed properly. This could lead to prolonged ICU stay, increased risk of falls, and potential long-term cognitive impairment.
6. Anorexia: The patient's inability to take PO medications is a concern, and if not managed properly, it could lead to malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and potential organ dysfunction.
7. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal, and if not managed properly, it could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and potential organ dysfunction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and cardiac output.
2. Continue to manage the patient's fluid overload with diuretics and monitor for signs of worsening heart failure.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent further kidney damage.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation levels and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent further desaturation.
5. Continue to manage the patient's delirium with medication and non-pharmacological interventions, and monitor for signs of worsening cognitive decline.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
7. Consider ordering a CT scan or MRI to further evaluate the patient's pulmonary embolism and potential other causes of her symptoms."
