   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80M with a history of CVA, who presents with pneumonia
   with sepsis physiology and significant hypernatremia.
   #. Sepsis:  Most likely etiology is from PNA seen on CXR. Has a
   leukocytosis with a left shift on differential.  Was admitted on a NRB,
   but has been weened down to 5L NC.  Hypotension on admission, but is
   markedly hypernatremic, so hypovolumia likely more to plan than from
   peripheral dilitation of vaculature. Patient was given levo/CTX/flagyl
   in ED.
   - send off sputum cultures and urine legionella
   - will add on vanc as lives in nursing home, and continue levoflox
   - aggressive fluid [**Known lastname 6076**], and pressors if necessary to keep MAP
   > 65
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Possibly due to pna, versus UTI
   #. Hypernatremia:  Unclear etiology, but likely from poor PO intake
   with insensible loses.  No history of gastrointestinal losses.  Would
   need to consider central or DI or dysregulation of thirst centers.
   Patient weighs 90 kg, so has a free water deficit 4.8 L.  Would ideally
   give 120ml of d5W per hour to correct patient within 56 hrs so as to
   not cause dangerous fluid shifts with correction.  However, given need
   for rapid fluid [**Last Name (LF) 6076**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] use 1/2 NS and matain close eye on
   sodium so as to not be lowered is by &#8804;0.5 meq/L per hour and no
   more than by 12 meq/L per day.  Likely etiology of altered mental
   status.
   - fluid correction with 1/2NS
   - will check urine osms
   #.  Lethargy:  Likely etilogy is from significant hypernatremia.  Also
   could be compounded from PNA.  UA shows no evidence of UTI.  With
   altered mental status and infection, would consider meningitis.  No
   nucall rigidity, and seems less likely at this time.
   - correct hypernatremia and treat PNA as given above.
   #. Renal failure:  Most likely from pre-renal, with low CVP and exam
   consistent with dehyrdation.  Other etiologies could be post-renal
   failure with history of BPH.  No great derangments on UA.  Unclear
   baseline.
   - recheck after fluid resusitation, if not normalizing, proceed with
   further work up.
   #. Hypercalcemia: Patient with history of paget's disease.  Likely
   hypercalcemia exacerbated by dehydration.  Will follow with fluid
   resusitation.
   #. CHF: currently hypovolemic.  Has [**1-8**]+ MR on prior TTE.  Will hold
   metoprolol and lasix in the setting of infection.
   #.  Hypothyroidism: cont sythroid
   #.  Hx of Stroke: cont ASA 81mg, could discuss increasing dose with
   PCP.
   #.  Schizoaffective disorder:  on Wellbutrin, zyprexa, and remeron as
   outpatient.  Will hold in the setting of altered mental status.
   #. FEN: replete lytes prn, will need S/S study, but will give pureed
   diet for now.
   #. PPX: Sc heparin, fall precautions, bowel regimen prn, PPI blocker
   with hx of GERD
   #. ACCESS: RIJ
   #. CODE STATUS: DNR but okay to intubate.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, pneumonia with sepsis physiology, and significant hypernatremia. He was admitted to the ICU with a NRB mask, but was weaned down to 5L nasal cannula. The patient has leukocytosis with a left shift on differential, and sputum cultures and urine legionella are pending. He is being treated with antibiotics and has a high risk of developing septic shock.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Septic Shock:** The patient's pneumonia with sepsis physiology and hypernatremia put him at high risk of developing septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. **Hypernatremia:** The patient's sodium levels are significantly elevated, which can cause neurological symptoms, including lethargy, confusion, and seizures. If not corrected, hypernatremia can lead to brain damage and death.
3. **Renal Failure:** The patient's low CVP and dehydration increase the risk of developing pre-renal failure, which can progress to acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
4. **Hypercalcemia:** The patient's history of paget's disease and hypercalcemia exacerbated by dehydration increase the risk of developing hypercalcemia-related complications, such as kidney damage and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. **Meningitis:** The patient's altered mental status, fever, and lethargy raise the possibility of meningitis, which can be caused by bacterial or viral infections.
6. **Dehydration:** The patient's dehydration can lead to hypovolemic shock, which can cause organ dysfunction and failure.
7. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient's poor PO intake and potential gastrointestinal losses increase the risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation, diarrhea, and nausea.
8. **Thyroid Complications:** The patient's hypothyroidism can be exacerbated by dehydration and hypernatremia, leading to worsening of symptoms.
9. **Stroke Complications:** The patient's history of CVA increases the risk of developing stroke complications, such as cerebral edema, hemorrhage, and seizure.
10. **Psychiatric Complications:** The patient's schizoaffective disorder can be exacerbated by altered mental status, leading to worsening of symptoms and potential psychiatric complications.

**Plan:**

1. Continue antibiotics and monitor for signs of septic shock.
2. Correct hypernatremia with 1/2 NS and closely monitor sodium levels.
3. Recheck urine osmolality and adjust fluid therapy as needed.
4. Monitor for signs of renal failure and consider further workup if necessary.
5. Follow up on hypercalcemia and consider further workup if necessary.
6. Monitor for signs of meningitis and consider further workup if necessary.
7. Continue to monitor for dehydration and hypovolemic shock.
8. Monitor for gastrointestinal complications and adjust fluid therapy as needed.
9. Monitor for thyroid complications and adjust medication as needed.
10. Monitor for stroke complications and adjust medication as needed.
11. Monitor for psychiatric complications and adjust medication as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80M with a history of CVA, who presents with pneumonia
   with sepsis physiology and significant hypernatremia.
   #. Sepsis:  Most likely etiology is from PNA seen on CXR. Has a
   leukocytosis with a neutrophilic predominance on differential.  Was
   admitted on a NRB, but has been weaned down to 5L NC.  Hypotension on
   admission, but is markedly hypernatremic, so hypovolumia likely more to
   plan than from peripheral dilitation of vaculature. Patient was given
   levo/CTX/flagyl in ED, continued on vanc/zosyn in MICU.
   - recheck CV O2 sat
   - continue NS boluses as needed for intravascular volume expansion with
   goal MAP > 65
   - continue vanc/zosyn given risk of healthcare-associated pneumonia
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   #. Hypernatremia:  Unclear etiology, but likely from poor PO intake
   with insensible loses.  No history of gastrointestinal losses.  Would
   need to consider central or DI or dysregulation of thirst centers.
   Patient weighs 90 kg and had a free water deficit of 7 L at
   presentation.
   - correct sodium at 1/2 mEq per hour with D5W at 150 cc/hr
   - trend chemistries tid
   - check urine osmoles
   - consider Duboff placement for free water boluses after discussion
   with family
   #. Renal failure:  Most likely from pre-renal, with low CVP and exam
   consistent with volume depletion.  Other etiologies could be post-renal
   failure with history of BPH.  Trending down with IVFs.  No great
   derangements on UA.  Unclear baseline.
   - obtain [**Hospital1 966**] records to clarify Creatinine baseline
   - recheck after fluid resuscitation, if not normalizing, proceed with
   further work up.
   #. Anemia:   Hct drop to 31 from 45 on admission with unknown baseline,
   likely closer to baseline now given volume depletion and hypernatremia
   at presentation.   Normal bilirubin.
   - recheck p.m. hct
   #. Hypercalcemia: Patient with history of paget's disease.  Likely
   hypercalcemia exacerbated by dehydration.  Will follow with fluid
   resuscitation.
   #. CHF:  Has [**1-8**]+ MR on prior TTE.  Will hold metoprolol and lasix in
   the setting of infection.
   #.  Hypothyroidism: cont synthroid
   #.  Hx of Stroke: cont ASA 81mg, could discuss increasing dose with
   PCP.
   #.  Schizoaffective disorder:  on Wellbutrin, zyprexa, and remeron as
   outpatient.  Will hold in the setting of altered mental status.
   #. FEN: replete lytes prn, will need S/S study, but will give pureed
   diet for now.
   #. PPX: Sc heparin, fall precautions, bowel regimen prn, PPI blocker
   with hx of GERD
   #. ACCESS: RIJ
   #. CODE STATUS: DNR but okay to intubate, family prefers to avoid
   aggressive/invasive procedures if possible and prioritize reducing
   patient
s discomfort.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, who presents with pneumonia with sepsis physiology and significant hypernatremia. He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving antibiotics and fluids. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, and blood pressure of 111/46 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 100% on a nasal cannula. His laboratory results show leukocytosis with a neutrophilic predominance, hypernatremia, and hypercalcemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further complications from sepsis, including organ dysfunction, shock, and death.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is likely due to poor oral intake and insensible losses, and may lead to complications such as dehydration, seizures, and coma.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he may be at risk for further decline in renal function, potentially leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and he may be at risk for further decline in hemoglobin levels, potentially leading to anemia and its complications.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia is likely due to dehydration and may lead to complications such as nausea, vomiting, and constipation.
6. CHF: The patient has a history of CHF and may be at risk for further decline in cardiac function, potentially leading to heart failure and its complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80M with a history of CVA, who presents with pneumonia
   with sepsis physiology and significant hypernatremia.
   #. Sepsis:  Most likely etiology is from PNA seen on CXR. Has a
   leukocytosis with a neutrophilic predominance on differential.  Was
   admitted on a NRB, but has been weaned down to 5L NC.  Hypotension on
   admission, but is markedly hypernatremic, so hypovolumia likely more to
   plan than from peripheral dilitation of vaculature. Patient was given
   levo/CTX/flagyl in ED, continued on vanc/zosyn in MICU.
   - recheck CV O2 sat
   - continue NS boluses as needed for intravascular volume expansion with
   goal MAP > 65
   - continue vanc/zosyn given risk of healthcare-associated pneumonia
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   #. Hypernatremia:  Unclear etiology, but likely from poor PO intake
   with insensible loses.  No history of gastrointestinal losses.  Would
   need to consider central or DI or dysregulation of thirst centers.
   Patient weighs 90 kg and had a free water deficit of 7 L at
   presentation.
   - correct sodium at 1/2 mEq per hour with D5W at 150 cc/hr
   - trend chemistries tid
   - check urine osmoles
   - consider Duboff placement for free water boluses after discussion
   with family
   #. Renal failure:  Most likely from pre-renal, with low CVP and exam
   consistent with volume depletion.  Other etiologies could be post-renal
   failure with history of BPH.  Trending down with IVFs.  No great
   derangements on UA.  Unclear baseline.
   - obtain [**Hospital1 966**] records to clarify Creatinine baseline
   - recheck after fluid resuscitation, if not normalizing, proceed with
   further work up.
   #. Anemia:   Hct drop to 31 from 45 on admission with unknown baseline,
   likely closer to baseline now given volume depletion and hypernatremia
   at presentation.   Normal bilirubin.
   - recheck p.m. hct
   #. Hypercalcemia: Patient with history of paget's disease.  Likely
   hypercalcemia exacerbated by dehydration.  Will follow with fluid
   resuscitation.
   #. CHF:  Has [**1-8**]+ MR on prior TTE.  Will hold metoprolol and lasix in
   the setting of infection.
   #.  Hypothyroidism: cont synthroid
   #.  Hx of Stroke: cont ASA 81mg, could discuss increasing dose with
   PCP.
   #.  Schizoaffective disorder:  on Wellbutrin, zyprexa, and remeron as
   outpatient.  Will hold in the setting of altered mental status.
   #. FEN: replete lytes prn, will need S/S study, but will give pureed
   diet for now.

   with hx of GERD
   #. ACCESS: RIJ
   #. CODE STATUS: DNR but okay to intubate, family prefers to avoid
   aggressive/invasive procedures if possible and prioritize reducing

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, is admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, sepsis physiology, and significant hypernatremia. He is receiving treatment for sepsis, including antibiotics and fluid boluses. His hypernatremia is likely due to poor oral intake and insensible losses. He is also experiencing renal failure, anemia, hypercalcemia, and CHF. His medical history includes paget's disease, hypothyroidism, schizoaffective disorder, and stroke.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis physiology may worsen if not properly managed, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may cause central nervous system symptoms, such as seizures or coma, if not corrected.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia may cause symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, and abdominal cramps if not corrected.
6. CHF: The patient's CHF may worsen if not properly managed, leading to pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, or heart failure.
7. Infection: The patient's infection may spread to other parts of the body if not properly managed, leading to sepsis or septic shock.
8. Thrombosis: The patient's hypercoagulable state may increase the risk of thrombosis, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of his sepsis, hypernatremia, renal failure, anemia, hypercalcemia, CHF, and other potential complications."
