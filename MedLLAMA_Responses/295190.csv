   pain, type 2 diabetes, and bladder and prostate cancer s/p ilieal
   conduit, found unresponsive at home; found to have severe nongap
   metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, likely acute renal failure.
   .
   # Severe metabolic acidosis.  Normal AG of 10.  Tox screen negative.
   Common AG acidosis triggers negative (lactate and ketones).
   Methanol/Eth glycol less likely, as would expect anion gap but will
   check levels and would be reasonable to start fomepizole per toxicology
   recs.  Regarding non-gap etiologies; ARF seems most likely.  No
   evidence of GI losses.  Respiratory compensation only slightly
   suboptimal (mild relative respiratory acidosis).  Most likely related
   to underlying low bicarb in the setting of an ileal conduit complicated
   by poor PO intake.  Received NaHCO3 & D5W yesterday
   - Cont. D5W, increased to 250 mL/hr
   - Follow lytes Q4H
   - Pt. can drink to thirst now that mental status has improved.
   .
   # Altered mental status.  Most likely toxic metabolic given the above.
   Possibility of ingestions, tox negative, getting toxic alcohols as
   above.  CT head read as without acute process per OSH ED records.  LFTs
   normal.  No role for NAC per tox (given negative level and normal
   LFTs).  He appears to be protecting his airway.  Mental status much
   improved today.

   # Renal failure - acute on chronic.  Recent creatinine from VA records
   = 1.7.  Still above baseline, but much improved today.  Patient has
   impressive urine output, so obstruction is unlikely.   Urine ultrasound
   wnl.  Per VA records pt. has previous history of acute on chronic renal
   failure.  Acute worsening of renal function likely a mix of pre-renal
   and metabolic abnormalities on presentation.
   - urine lytes

   # Positive UA. unclear anatomy. ? ileum serving as bladder, in which
   case significance of pyuria is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] is afebrile and HD stable.
   - hold on antibiotics for now unless fevers, etc
   - gather info on anatomy and past urologic procedures
   - consider urology consult
   .
   # Hyperkalemia. no acute EKG changes on presentation.  Hyperkalemia now
   resolved.  Will continue to follow.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Free water deficit roughly 7L today.  Elevation in Na
   overnight likely related to combination of sodium in NaHCO3 and
   impressive urine output, likely very dilute.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient has severe nongap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and likely acute renal failure. He has improved mental status and is able to interact and speak more clearly. The patient has a history of ileal conduit and is at risk for poor PO intake, which may contribute to his metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Severe metabolic acidosis: The patient's severe metabolic acidosis is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment. Failure to correct the acidosis may lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory failure, and decreased cardiac output.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed promptly. This may lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and cardiovascular instability.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia may worsen if not managed promptly. This may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and respiratory failure.
4. Infections: The patient's altered mental status and poor PO intake may increase his risk of developing infections, which may worsen his condition.
5. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's poor PO intake and altered mental status may increase his risk of developing nutritional deficiencies, which may worsen his condition.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypertension and cardiac history may increase his risk of developing cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and stroke.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory acidosis and altered mental status may increase his risk of developing respiratory complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's acid-base status and adjust treatment as necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment as necessary.
4. Consider a urology consult to further evaluate the patient's urinary tract and address any potential complications.
5. Consider a nephrology consult to further evaluate the patient's renal function and address any potential complications.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment as necessary.
8. Consider a nutrition consult to further evaluate the patient's nutritional status and address any potential deficiencies."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 66 M with PMH of EtOH abuse, HTN, hypothyroidism, neuropathic
   pain, type 2 diabetes, and bladder and prostate cancer s/p ilieal
   conduit, found unresponsive at home; found to have severe nongap
   metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, likely acute renal failure.
   .
   # Severe metabolic acidosis.  Normal AG of 10.  Tox screen negative.
   Common AG acidosis triggers negative (lactate and ketones).
   Methanol/Eth glycol less likely, as would expect anion gap but will
   check levels and would be reasonable to start fomepizole per toxicology
   recs.  Regarding non-gap etiologies; ARF seems most likely.  No
   evidence of GI losses.  Respiratory compensation only slightly
   suboptimal (mild relative respiratory acidosis).  Most likely related
   to underlying low bicarb in the setting of an ileal conduit complicated
   by poor PO intake.  Received NaHCO3 & D5W yesterday
   - Cont. D5W, increased to 250 mL/hr
   - Follow lytes Q4H
   - Pt. can drink to thirst now that mental status has improved.
   .
   # Altered mental status.  Most likely toxic metabolic given the above.
   Possibility of ingestions, tox negative, getting toxic alcohols as
   above.  CT head read as without acute process per OSH ED records.  LFTs
   normal.  No role for NAC per tox (given negative level and normal
   LFTs).  He appears to be protecting his airway.  Mental status much
   improved today.
   - follow
   - avoid sedating meds
   .
   # Renal failure - acute on chronic.  Recent creatinine from VA records
   = 1.7.  Still above baseline, but much improved today.  Patient has
   impressive urine output, so obstruction is unlikely.   Urine ultrasound
   wnl.  Per VA records pt. has previous history of acute on chronic renal
   failure.  Acute worsening of renal function likely a mix of pre-renal
   and metabolic abnormalities on presentation.
   - urine lytes
   - trend creatinine
   - nephrology following, their recs appreciated.  \
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Positive UA. unclear anatomy. ? ileum serving as bladder, in which
   case significance of pyuria is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] is afebrile and HD stable.
   - hold on antibiotics for now unless fevers, etc
   - gather info on anatomy and past urologic procedures
   - consider urology consult
   .
   # Hyperkalemia. no acute EKG changes on presentation.  Hyperkalemia now
   resolved.  Will continue to follow.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Free water deficit roughly 7L today.  Elevation in Na
   overnight likely related to combination of sodium in NaHCO3 and
   impressive urine output, likely very dilute.
   - cont. free water repletion with D5W
   - allow patient to drink water now that MS has improved
   - urine lytes
   .
   # Anemia. mild, unclear baseline.
   - follow
   .
   # hx of HTN. Is on lisinopril as an outpatient, but will hold this
   medication given current acute worsening of renal function.
   - will trial hydralazine today
   .
   # PPx: H2 blocker, bowel reg, sc heparin
   .
   # Code: presumed full
   .
   # Dispo: ICU, can likely be called out to floor tomorrow.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 66 yo M with  bladder / prostate cancer with
   renal diversion, EtOH abuse, HTN, DM2 admitted with NAG acidosis,
   hypernatremia, hyperkalemia and ARF. Found down by family with profound
   aciosis, pH 7.0. Yesterday had A-line placed, renal us unremarkable,
   bicarb and D5, renal consult appreciated, insulin regimen increased.
   Had run wide complex tachycardia last night, HD stable.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.2   Tc 97.8 BP 132/65 HR 68-94 RR 18 with sat 99
   on RA, - 1 Liter  More alert (oriented X 3, only confused about
   which hospital but knows he is in ICU), cooperative, in NAD. CTA B rrr
   Soft NT +BS. No edema. Labs notable for WBC 3.7, HCT 31.4, na 155, K+
   4.0, Cr 2.4 (coming down). No new CXR; MICRO with urine GNRs --> 100K e
   coli ( [**5-15**] rbc and wbc on u/a)
   66 yo M who presented with profound NAG acidosis and ARF.
   Agree with plan to continue rehydration with NaHCO3 IVP and
   aggressive IV D5W repletion for acidosis and hypernatremia.
   Hyperkalemia has resolved.  AMS likely related to electrolyte
   abnormlaities and hypernatremia, now much improved. Appreciate renal
   input.  ARF is improving (VA OSH lab of 1.7 cr-? baseline). U/a with >
   100K e coli but given diversion suspect this is colonization as [**5-15**]
   rbc and wbc on u/a, remains af, and hemodynamically stable. Will need
   RISS for hyperglycemia in the setting of DM2 and aggressive D5W
   repletion. Will continue CIWA for possible etoh withdrawal-though has
   not required. Will start hydral for htn. OSH records list lisinopril,
   but will continue to hold given ARF. Will restart synthroid (check TSH)
   and asa. Advance diet with supervision. Remainder of plan as outlined
   above. Improving clinically but continue in ICU for now.  Monitor tachy
   runs on tele and follow lytes closely. Anticipate transition to floor
   tomorrow.
   Patient is critically ill.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   A/P: 66 M with PMH of EtOH abuse, HTN, hypothyroidism, neuropathic
   pain, type 2 diabetes, and bladder and prostate cancer s/p ilieal
   conduit, found unresponsive at home; found to have severe nongap
   metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, likely acute renal failure.
   .
   # Severe metabolic acidosis.  Normal AG of 10.  Tox screen negative.
   Common AG acidosis triggers negative (lactate and ketones).
   Methanol/Eth glycol less likely, as would expect anion gap but will
   check levels and would be reasonable to start fomepizole per toxicology
   recs.  Regarding non-gap etiologies; ARF seems most likely.  No
   evidence of GI losses.  Respiratory compensation only slightly
   suboptimal (mild relative respiratory acidosis).  Most likely related
   to underlying low bicarb in the setting of an ileal conduit complicated
   by poor PO intake.  Received NaHCO3 & D5W yesterday
   - Cont. D5W, increased to 250 mL/hr
   - Follow lytes Q4H
   - Pt. can drink to thirst now that mental status has improved.
   .
   # Altered mental status.  Most likely toxic metabolic given the above.
   Possibility of ingestions, tox negative, getting toxic alcohols as
   above.  CT head read as without acute process per OSH ED records.  LFTs
   normal.  No role for NAC per tox (given negative level and normal
   LFTs).  He appears to be protecting his airway.  Mental status much
   improved today.
   - follow
   - avoid sedating meds
   .
   # Renal failure - acute on chronic.  Recent creatinine from VA records
   = 1.7.  Still above baseline, but much improved today.  Patient has
   impressive urine output, so obstruction is unlikely.   Urine ultrasound
   wnl.  Per VA records pt. has previous history of acute on chronic renal
   failure.  Acute worsening of renal function likely a mix of pre-renal
   and metabolic abnormalities on presentation.
   - urine lytes
   - trend creatinine
   - nephrology following, their recs appreciated.  \
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Positive UA. unclear anatomy. ? ileum serving as bladder, in which
   case significance of pyuria is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] is afebrile and HD stable.
   - hold on antibiotics for now unless fevers, etc
   - gather info on anatomy and past urologic procedures
   - consider urology consult
   .
   # Hyperkalemia. no acute EKG changes on presentation.  Hyperkalemia now
   resolved.  Will continue to follow.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Free water deficit roughly 7L today.  Elevation in Na
   overnight likely related to combination of sodium in NaHCO3 and
   impressive urine output, likely very dilute.
   - cont. free water repletion with D5W
   - allow patient to drink water now that MS has improved
   - urine lytes
   .
   # Anemia. mild, unclear baseline.
   - follow
   .
   # hx of HTN. Is on lisinopril as an outpatient, but will hold this
   medication given current acute worsening of renal function.
   - will trial hydralazine today
   .
   # PPx: H2 blocker, bowel reg, sc heparin
   .
   # Code: presumed full
   .
   # Dispo: ICU, can likely be called out to floor tomorrow.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 66 yo M with  bladder / prostate cancer with
   renal diversion, EtOH abuse, HTN, DM2 admitted with NAG acidosis,
   hypernatremia, hyperkalemia and ARF. Found down by family with profound
   aciosis, pH 7.0. Yesterday had A-line placed, renal us unremarkable,
   bicarb and D5, renal consult appreciated, insulin regimen increased.
   Had run wide complex tachycardia last night, HD stable.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.2   Tc 97.8 BP 132/65 HR 68-94 RR 18 with sat 99
   on RA, - 1 Liter  More alert (oriented X 3, only confused about
   which hospital but knows he is in ICU), cooperative, in NAD. CTA B rrr
   Soft NT +BS. No edema. Labs notable for WBC 3.7, HCT 31.4, na 155, K+
   4.0, Cr 2.4 (coming down). No new CXR; MICRO with urine GNRs --> 100K e
   coli ( [**5-15**] rbc and wbc on u/a)
   66 yo M who presented with profound NAG acidosis and ARF.
   Agree with plan to continue rehydration with NaHCO3 IVP and
   aggressive IV D5W repletion for acidosis and hypernatremia.
   Hyperkalemia has resolved.  AMS likely related to electrolyte
   abnormlaities and hypernatremia, now much improved. Appreciate renal
   input.  ARF is improving (VA OSH lab of 1.7 cr-? baseline). U/a with >
   100K e coli but given diversion suspect this is colonization as [**5-15**]
   rbc and wbc on u/a, remains af, and hemodynamically stable. Will need
   RISS for hyperglycemia in the setting of DM2 and aggressive D5W
   repletion. Will continue CIWA for possible etoh withdrawal-though has
   not required. Will start hydral for htn. OSH records list lisinopril,
   but will continue to hold given ARF. Will restart synthroid (check TSH)
   and asa. Advance diet with supervision. Remainder of plan as outlined
   above. Improving clinically but continue in ICU for now.  Monitor tachy
   runs on tele and follow lytes closely. Anticipate transition to floor
   tomorrow.
   Patient is critically ill.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a complex medical history, including ethanol abuse, hypertension, hypothyroidism, neuropathic pain, type 2 diabetes, and bladder and prostate cancer with an ileal conduit. He was found unresponsive at home and was admitted to the ICU with severe non-gap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and likely acute renal failure.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Severe metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap
* Hyperkalemia that has resolved
* Mild anemia
* Hypernatremia with a free water deficit of approximately 7L
* Acute kidney injury with a recent creatinine level of 1.7 (improved from baseline)

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Mild respiratory acidosis
* No acute distress
* Overweight/obese
* Normal cardiovascular examination
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* No muscle wasting
* Warm, no rash
* Normal neurologic examination with some memory deficits

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continuation of D5W for rehydration and acidosis management
* Increased sodium bicarbonate infusion
* Free water repletion with D5W
* Trial of hydralazine for hypertension
* Hold on lisinopril due to acute kidney injury
* Restart of synthroid and ASA
* Advance diet with supervision

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening of metabolic acidosis
* Hyperkalemia
* Acute kidney injury
* Hypernatremia
* Hypoglycemia due to increased insulin regimen
* Infection due to ileal conduit and urinary tract colonization
* Pulmonary complications due to respiratory acidosis
* Cardiovascular complications due to hypertension and hyperkalemia
* Gastrointestinal complications due to ileal conduit and bowel regimen

The patient's condition is improving clinically, but he remains critically ill and requires close monitoring."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:
   66 M with unclear PMH, found unresponsive at home; found to have severe
   nongap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, likely acute renal failure.
   .
   # Severe metabolic acidosis.  Normal AG of 10.  Tox screen negative.
   Common AG acidosis triggers negative (lactate and ketones).
   Methanol/Eth glycol less likely, as would expect anion gap but will
   check levels and would be reasonable to start fomepizole per toxicology
   recs.  Regarding non-gap etiologies; ARF seems most likely.  No
   evidence of GI losses.  Respiratory compensation only slightly
   suboptimal (mild relative respiratory acidosis).
   - sodium bicarb in D5W
   - appreciate tox recs
   - consider start fomepizole, 15mg/kg IV loading dose.
   - send methanol and ethylene glycol levels STAT to [**Hospital1 1910**] (per tox).
   - ARF workup and management as detailed below.
   - serum osmolality for osmol gap
   .
   # Altered mental status.  Most likely toxic metabolic given the above.
   Possibility of ingestions, tox negative, getting toxic alcohols as
   above.  CT head read as without acute process per OSH ED records.  LFTs
   normal.  No role for NAC per tox (given negative level and normal
   LFTs).  He appears to be protecting his airway.
   - follow
   - avoid sedating meds
   .
   # Renal failure. Acute vs. acute on chronic.  Baseline unknown.  Has
   reported history of obstruction so postrenal is a possibility.
   Intrarenal still on differential as is prerenal considering his unknown
   length of time down.
   - Obtain baselines
   - urine lytes
   - renal u/s
   - trend creatinine
   - nephrology aware, will see in AM.
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Positive UA. unclear anatomy. ? ileum serving as bladder, in which
   case significance of pyuria is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] is afebrile and HD stable.
   - hold on antibiotics for now unless fevers, etc
   - gather info on anatomy and past urologic procedures
   - consider urology consult
   .
   # Hyperkalemia. no acute EKG changes.  Suspect he will not cooperate
   with kayexalate.
   - trend K, if worsens/develops EKG changes, can consider insulin, etc.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Free water deficit roughly 3-4 L.
   - free water repletion.
   .
   # Anemia. mild, unclear baseline.
   - follow
   .
   # hx of HTN. unknown if currently treated.
   - no antihypertensives for now as not significantly hypertensive
   - medication reconciliation.
   .
   # PPx: H2 blocker, bowel reg, sc heparin
   .
   # Code: presumed full

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male who was found unresponsive at home and was admitted to the ICU with severe nongap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and likely acute renal failure. The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Worsening of metabolic acidosis: The patient's severe metabolic acidosis can worsen if not properly managed, leading to further acidosis and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and potentially life-threatening complications if not properly managed.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can worsen if not properly managed, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if not properly managed, leading to further respiratory complications and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Infections: The patient's altered mental status and positive UA can increase the risk of infections, which can worsen his condition and potentially lead to sepsis and organ failure.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's hyperkalemia and acidosis can lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and potentially life-threatening cardiac events.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's altered mental status and positive UA can increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status can worsen if not properly managed, leading to further neurological complications and potentially life-threatening complications.

To manage these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU. This includes:

1. Monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values to detect any changes or worsening of the patient's condition.
2. Management of metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and acute renal failure with medications and fluids as needed.
3. Monitoring of respiratory status and providing respiratory support as needed.
4. Monitoring of electrolyte levels and providing electrolyte replacement as needed.
5. Monitoring of urine output and providing diuretic therapy as needed.
6. Monitoring of blood pressure and providing antihypertensive therapy as needed.
7. Monitoring of cardiac status and providing cardiac support as needed.
8. Monitoring of neurological status and providing sedation and analgesia as needed.
9. Monitoring of gastrointestinal status and providing antiemetic therapy as needed.
10. Monitoring of infection risk and providing antibiotics as needed.

The patient's care requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving the ICU team, nephrologists, cardiologists, and other specialists as needed. Close communication and collaboration are essential to ensure the patient receives the best possible care and management of his complex condition."
