   Assessment and Plan
   27 yo M with metastatic melanoma presenting with large volume
   hematemesis.
   .
   1. Hematemesis - unclear if source is GI vs. nasopharyngeal. EGD done
   upon arrival to MICU showed most evidence of blood in upper airway;
   that being said, there is a lesion suspicious for metastasis in the
   antrum of the stomach, however it does not appear to be the source of
   the bleed at this time. More concerning, however, is the marked
   progression of the nasopharyngeal mass seen on MRI head on [**4-29**]. A
   posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma could explain his
   large volume epistaxis and hematemesis.
   - GI input appreciated
   - ENT visualized two nasopharyngeal masses - ?active bleeding, not
   surgical options
   - rad onc consulted, plan for XRT if no rebleeding
   - if rebleed, plan is to call anesthesia for oral airway, then
   thoracics for possible surgical airway if needed. Then call
   interventional neuroradiology for embolization
   - continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **] (evidence of gastritis)
   - continue 2 large bore IV's
   - maintain active type and screen
   - monitor Q6 hour hcts x 3
   - s/p 3 unit pRBC's
   - keep NPO for now, consider ADAT to clears
   - if hypotensive, consider adding stress dose steroids
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   2. Leukocytosis - recently started on prednisone 20mg daily on [**2181-4-20**]
   by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**]. No evidence of infection at this time, but will
   continue to monitor.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   3. Hyponatremia - patient has been struggling for months now with
   nausea, vomiting and difficulty tolerating PO. He could be very
   dehydrated. Already received 2L NS in ED, and will give pRBC's here,
   with continuation of IVF overnight. On last admission sodium was wnl.
   Cr is just slightly elevated, also raising suspicion for mild prerenal
   azotemia.
   - monitor
   - IVF, NS PRN
   .
   4. Tachycardia - resolving with IVF. Will monitor on tele.
   .
   5. Metastatic Melanoma - currently traveling to [**Location (un) 3327**] to see Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 5606**] for evaluation for the Plexikon clinical trial. He is awaiting
   tumor tissue analysis to determine eligibility. It is unclear when the
   next open slot will be and another cycle of chemotherapy was advised
   given his symptoms, which was initiated on [**2181-4-20**].
   - supportive care, pain regimen
   - further plan per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5607**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**] (they are aware of
   patient
s admission)
   .
   6. FEN - IVF and pRBC's. NPO until plan is finalized, then advance to
   clears as tolerated. Replete lytes prn.
   .
   7. Access - 2 18 gauges
   .
   8. Code - Full, confirmed with patient
   .
   9. ICU Care - iv ppi given evidence of gastritis, pneumoboots
   .
   10. Dispo - ICU for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old male with metastatic melanoma who presented to the ICU with large-volume hematemesis. The patient's condition has been unstable, with a fever of 101.4°F (38.6°C) overnight, which was asymptomatic. The patient has a history of nausea, vomiting, and difficulty tolerating oral intake, which may be contributing to his dehydration and hyponatremia.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a WBC count of 17.7 K/uL, and hyponatremia, with a sodium level of 120 mEq/L. The patient's Cr level is slightly elevated, which may indicate mild prerenal azotemia. The patient's platelet count is 368 K/uL, and his Hct is 29.1%.

The patient's physical examination reveals a pale and weak-appearing individual with evidence of ulceration on the esophagus. The patient's neurologic examination is nonfocal, and his skin is without rash.

The patient's medical plan includes continued IV ppi for gastritis, maintenance of active type and screen, and monitoring of Q6-hour Hct for 3 days. The patient will receive 3 units of PRBCs and will be kept NPO for now, with consideration of ADAT to clear. If hypotensive, the patient may require addition of stress-dose steroids.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Bleeding: The patient's large-volume hematemesis and nasopharyngeal bleed may continue, requiring further intervention.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and fever may indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be monitored and treated promptly.
3. Dehydration: The patient's hyponatremia and difficulty tolerating oral intake may lead to further dehydration, requiring IV fluids and electrolyte replacement.
4. Prerenal azotemia: The patient's slightly elevated Cr level may indicate mild prerenal azotemia, which needs to be monitored and treated promptly.
5. Metastatic disease progression: The patient's metastatic melanoma may continue to progress, requiring further evaluation and treatment.
6. Nutritional compromise: The patient's difficulty tolerating oral intake may lead to nutritional compromise, requiring enteral or parenteral nutrition support.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's evidence of gastritis and ulceration may lead to further gastrointestinal bleeding, requiring further intervention."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a significant medical history, including a diagnosis of melanoma and previous gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.4°F (38.6°C) overnight, which has since decreased to 98.3°F (36.8°C). The patient's heart rate is within normal limits, and blood pressure is stable. Respiratory support is not required, and oxygen saturation is 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 17.7 K/uL (elevated)
* Hemoglobin: 9.7 g/dL (low)
* Platelet count: 368 K/uL (elevated)
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL (normal)
* Glucose: 92 mg/dL (normal)
* Other laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes, altered liver function, and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the lack of assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed and is currently being treated for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (melena). The patient is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis is being provided.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis due to the elevated white blood cell count and fever
* Hemorrhagic complications due to the patient's history of gastrointestinal bleed and ongoing bleeding
* DVT and pulmonary embolism due to the patient's immobility and risk factors
* Stress ulcer and gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's history of gastrointestinal bleed and medications
* Electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances due to the patient's liver dysfunction and kidney function
* Infection and sepsis due to the patient's immunocompromised state and cancer diagnosis
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying medical conditions and potential for respiratory complications"

Summary:

The patient is a 70-inch tall individual with a fever of 101.4°F (38.6°C) overnight, which is asymptomatic. They were cultured for blood at 11:00 PM. The patient has a history of melanoma and is currently experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, with evidence of ulceration on endoscopy. They are receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/74 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and blood culture may indicate the presence of an infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing bleeding may continue to worsen, leading to hypovolemic shock or other complications.
3. Melanoma recurrence: The patient's history of melanoma increases their risk of recurrence, which could have implications for their treatment and prognosis.
4. VAP: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia due to their respiratory support and prolonged mechanical ventilation.
5. DVT: The patient's immobility and risk factors may increase their risk for deep vein thrombosis.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness and use of corticosteroids may increase their risk for stress ulcer bleeding.
7. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level may indicate anemia, which could exacerbate their respiratory and cardiovascular status.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show abnormal electrolyte levels, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias or other complications.
9. Infection: The patient's history of melanoma and gastrointestinal bleeding may increase their risk for infection, which could have implications for their treatment and prognosis."

   Assessment and Plan
   27 yo M with metastatic melanoma presenting with large volume
   hematemesis.
   .
   1. Hematemesis - unclear if source is GI vs. nasopharyngeal. EGD done
   upon arrival to MICU showed most evidence of blood in upper airway;
   that being said, there is a lesion suspicious for metastasis in the
   antrum of the stomach, however it does not appear to be the source of
   the bleed at this time. More concerning, however, is the marked
   progression of the nasopharyngeal mass seen on MRI head on [**4-29**]. A
   posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma could explain his
   large volume epistaxis and hematemesis.
   - appreciate GI input and EGD, will review final report
   - continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **]
   - ENT consult for nasopharyngeal mass - ?active bleeding
   - continue 2 large bore IV's
   - maintain active type and screen
   - monitor Q6 hour hcts x 3
   - 2 unit pRBC's now, 2 additional crossmatched
   - keep NPO for now, consider ADAT to clears later after ENT eval
   - if hypotensive, consider adding stress dose steroids
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   2. Leukocytosis - recently started on prednisone 20mg daily on [**2181-4-20**]
   by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**]. No evidence of infection at this time, but will
   continue to monitor.
   .
   3. Hyponatremia - patient has been struggling for months now with
   nausea, vomiting and difficulty tolerating PO. He could be very
   dehydrated. Already received 2L NS in ED, and will give pRBC's here,
   with continuation of IVF overnight. On last admission sodium was wnl.
   Cr is just slightly elevated, also raising suspicion for mild prerenal
   azotemia.
   - monitor
   - NS 1L @ 175cc/hr
   - recheck PM lytes
   .
   4. Tachycardia - resolving with IVF. Will monitor on tele.
   .
   5. Metastatic Melanoma - currently travelling to [**Location (un) 3327**] to see
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5606**] for evaluation for the Plexikon clinical trial. He is
   awaiting tumor tissue analysis to determine eligibility. It is unclear
   when the next open slot will be and another cycle of chemotherapy was
   advised given his symptoms, which was initiated on [**2181-4-20**].
   - supportive care
   - further plan per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5607**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**]
   .
   6. FEN - IVF and pRBC's. NPO until ENT eval, then advance to clears as
   tolerated. Replete lytes prn.
   .
   7. Access - 2 18 gauges
   .
   8. Code - Full, confirmed with patient
   .
   9. ICU Care - iv ppi given evidence of gastritis, pneumoboots
   .
   10. Dispo - ICU until documented to be hemodynamically stable x 24
   hours

   27 yo M with metastatic melanoma presenting with large volume
   hematemesis.
   .
   1. Hematemesis - unclear if source is GI vs. nasopharyngeal. EGD done
   upon arrival to MICU showed most evidence of blood in upper airway;
   that being said, there is a lesion suspicious for metastasis in the
   antrum of the stomach, however it does not appear to be the source of
   the bleed at this time. More concerning, however, is the marked
   progression of the nasopharyngeal mass seen on MRI head on [**4-29**]. A
   posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma could explain his
   large volume epistaxis and hematemesis.
   - appreciate GI input and EGD, will review final report
   - continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **]
   - ENT consult for nasopharyngeal mass - ?active bleeding
   - continue 2 large bore IV's
   - maintain active type and screen
   - monitor Q6 hour hcts x 3
   - 2 unit pRBC's now, 2 additional crossmatched
   - keep NPO for now, consider ADAT to clears later after ENT eval
   - if hypotensive, consider adding stress dose steroids
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   2. Leukocytosis - recently started on prednisone 20mg daily on [**2181-4-20**]
   by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**]. No evidence of infection at this time, but will
   continue to monitor.
   .
   3. Hyponatremia - patient has been struggling for months now with
   nausea, vomiting and difficulty tolerating PO. He could be very
   dehydrated. Already received 2L NS in ED, and will give pRBC's here,
   with continuation of IVF overnight. On last admission sodium was wnl.
   Cr is just slightly elevated, also raising suspicion for mild prerenal
   azotemia.
   - monitor
   - NS 1L @ 175cc/hr
   - recheck PM lytes

Summary:

The patient is a 27-year-old male with metastatic melanoma presenting with large-volume hematemesis. He has undergone an EGD, which showed evidence of blood in the upper airway, but not the source of the bleed. A nasopharyngeal mass is suspected to be the cause of the epistaxis and hematemesis. The patient has leukocytosis, hyponatremia, tachycardia, and mild prerenal azotemia. He is receiving supportive care, including IV fluids, pRBCs, and electrolyte repletion.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's nasopharyngeal mass may continue to bleed, leading to further hematemesis and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen his condition.
3. Dehydration: The patient's hyponatremia and history of nausea, vomiting, and difficulty tolerating PO may indicate dehydration, which could lead to further complications.
4. Cardiac Issues: The patient's tachycardia may be a sign of cardiac issues, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Metastatic Disease: The patient's metastatic melanoma may continue to progress, leading to further complications and potentially life-threatening outcomes.
6. Nutritional Issues: The patient's NPO status and history of difficulty tolerating PO may lead to nutritional deficiencies and further complications.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's hyponatremia and mild prerenal azotemia may lead to electrolyte imbalances, which could worsen his condition.
8. Renal Issues: The patient's mild prerenal azotemia may indicate early renal damage, which could worsen with further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   27 yo M with metastatic melanoma presenting with large volume
   hematemesis.
   .
   1. Hematemesis - unclear if source is GI vs. nasopharyngeal. EGD done
   upon arrival to MICU showed most evidence of blood in upper airway;
   that being said, there is a lesion suspicious for metastasis in the
   antrum of the stomach, however it does not appear to be the source of
   the bleed at this time. More concerning, however, is the marked
   progression of the nasopharyngeal mass seen on MRI head on [**4-29**]. A
   posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma could explain his
   large volume epistaxis and hematemesis. GI input appreciated. ENT
   visualized two nasopharyngeal masses - ?active bleeding, not surgical
   options. XRT started yesterday, plan for 10 treatments total. IR
   embolization yesterday without complication.
   - if rebleed, plan is to call anesthesia for oral airway, then
   thoracics for possible surgical airway if needed.
   - continue PPI (evidence of gastritis)
   - continue 2 large bore IV's
   - maintain active type and screen
   - monitor hct
   - s/p 3 unit pRBC's
   - ADAT
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   2. Leukocytosis - recently started on prednisone 20mg daily on [**2181-4-20**]
   by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**]. No evidence of infection at this time, but will
   continue to monitor.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   3. Hyponatremia - patient has been struggling for months now with
   nausea, vomiting and difficulty tolerating PO. He could be very
   dehydrated. Received 2L NS in ED, and 3 units pRBC's here, with
   continuation of IVF to maintain UOP. On last admission sodium was wnl.
   Cr was also just slightly elevated, also raising suspicion for mild
   prerenal azotemia.
   - monitor
   - IVF, NS PRN
   .
   4. Tachycardia
 Possibly related to tumor, also following cultures as
   above. Appears to resolve some with IVF. Will monitor on tele.
   .
   5. Metastatic Melanoma - currently traveling to [**Location (un) 3327**] to see Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 5606**] for evaluation for the Plexikon clinical trial. He is awaiting
   tumor tissue analysis to determine eligibility. It is unclear when the
   next open slot will be and another cycle of chemotherapy was advised
   given his symptoms, which was initiated on [**2181-4-20**].
   - supportive care, pain regimen
   - further plan per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5607**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**] (they are aware of
   patient
s admission)
   .
   6. FEN - IVF and pRBC's. advance diet as tolerated. Replete lytes prn.
   .
   7. Access - 2 18 gauges, plan to remove a-line prior to transfer to the
   [**Hospital Ward Name **].
   .
   8. Code - Full, confirmed with patient
   .
   9. ICU Care - ppi given evidence of gastritis, pneumoboots
   .
   10. Dispo - ICU for now, plan to transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name **] for XRT

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old male with metastatic melanoma who presented with large volume hematemesis. The patient has undergone radiation therapy, IR embolization, and has been receiving supportive care, pain management, and chemotherapy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 38.4°C (101.2°F), Tcurrent 37.8°C (100°F), HR 115 bpm, BP 148/82 mmHg, RR 16 inspirations per minute, SpO2 96%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient has a central venous catheter and an arterial line in place.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received 4,092 mL of fluids, with a total output of 3,070 mL, resulting in a positive fluid balance of 1,022 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is not receiving oxygen therapy, but has an SpO2 of 96%.
* Laboratory results: The patient has leukocytosis (WBC 17.7-20.8 K/uL), hyponatremia (sodium 108-121 mg/dL), and mild prerenal azotemia (creatinine 0.9-1.0 mg/dL).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Bleeding: The patient has a history of large volume hematemesis and may continue to bleed, potentially leading to hypovolemic shock.
2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and is receiving immunosuppressive therapy, making him susceptible to infection.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which can lead to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and seizures if not treated.
4. Prerenal azotemia: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating kidney damage, which can progress to acute kidney injury if not treated.
5. Tumor progression: The patient has metastatic melanoma, which can progress and cause further complications, such as bleeding, infection, and organ failure.
6. Radiation therapy side effects: The patient is receiving radiation therapy, which can cause side effects such as fatigue, nausea, and skin irritation.
7. Immune suppression: The patient is receiving immunosuppressive therapy, which can increase the risk of infection and other complications.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic status, and laboratory results.
2. Provide supportive care, including pain management and hydration.
3. Continue radiation therapy and chemotherapy as planned.
4. Monitor for signs of bleeding, infection, and tumor progression.
5. Consider adjusting the patient's immunosuppressive therapy to minimize the risk of infection.
6. Provide prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection.
7. Monitor the patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
8. Consider transferring the patient to a higher level of care, such as an intensive care unit, if his condition deteriorates."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a male with a history of melanoma and is currently receiving radiation therapy and embolization for bilateral spheno-palantine branches of the internal maxillary artery. They are being treated in the ICU for tachycardia, anxiety, and gastrointestinal bleeding (melena). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 115 bpm, and blood pressure of 148/82 mmHg. The patient is receiving infusions of lorazepam and hydromorphone for anxiety and pain management.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. Radiation-induced complications: The patient is receiving radiation therapy, which can cause skin reactions, fatigue, and gastrointestinal toxicity.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's current gastrointestinal bleeding (melena) may worsen, leading to hemorrhagic shock or requiring urgent endoscopy.
3. Infection: The patient's fever (101.2°F) may indicate an underlying infection, which could spread and worsen the patient's condition.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia (heart rate of 115 bpm) may be a sign of cardiac instability, which could lead to arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.
5. Renal complications: The patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels may be affected by the radiation therapy, embolization, and infusions, potentially leading to acute kidney injury or electrolyte imbalances.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's current neurological status is not assessed, but radiation therapy and embolization may cause neurological deficits or seizures.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support is currently not required, but radiation therapy and embolization may cause respiratory distress or failure.

**Recommendations:**

1. Monitor the patient's vital signs closely, particularly temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure.
2. Continue to manage the patient's anxiety and pain with lorazepam and hydromorphone infusions.
3. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and consider urgent endoscopy if the bleeding worsens.
4. Consider antibiotics if the patient's fever persists or worsens.
5. Monitor the patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels closely, and consider adjusting infusions as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and consider neurological consult if deficits or changes are noted.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider respiratory consult if respiratory distress or failure develops."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old post-operative patient in the ICU following radiation therapy and IR embolization for melanoma. They have a history of gastrointestinal bleed and are currently experiencing fever, tachycardia, and anemia. Their vital signs are stable, but they are pale and weak-appearing. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and liver enzymes. They are receiving infusions of lorazepam and hydromorphone for anxiety and pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly.
2. Bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleed and anemia may increase the risk of bleeding complications, especially with the use of anticoagulant medications.
3. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of central lines may increase the risk of infection, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver dysfunction, which can lead to coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and other complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen their symptoms and increase the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Respiratory compromise: The patient's tachycardia and anemia may increase their risk of respiratory compromise, especially if they experience a sudden drop in blood pressure or cardiac output.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and anemia may increase their risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or cardiac failure.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and aggressive management of the patient's symptoms, as well as ongoing evaluation of their laboratory results and clinical status."

   Assessment and Plan
   27 yo M with metastatic melanoma presenting with large volume
   hematemesis.
   .
   1. Hematemesis - unclear if source is GI vs. nasopharyngeal. EGD done
   upon arrival to MICU showed most evidence of blood in upper airway;
   that being said, there is a lesion suspicious for metastasis in the
   antrum of the stomach, however it does not appear to be the source of
   the bleed at this time. More concerning, however, is the marked
   progression of the nasopharyngeal mass seen on MRI head on [**4-29**]. A
   posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma could explain his
   large volume epistaxis and hematemesis.
   - GI input appreciated
   - ENT visualized two nasopharyngeal masses - ?active bleeding, not
   surgical options
   - rad onc consulted, plan for XRT if no rebleeding
   - if rebleed, plan is to call anesthesia for oral airway, then
   thoracics for possible surgical airway if needed. Then call
   interventional neuroradiology for embolization
   - continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **] (evidence of gastritis)
   - continue 2 large bore IV's
   - maintain active type and screen
   - monitor Q6 hour hcts x 3
   - s/p 3 unit pRBC's
   - keep NPO for now, consider ADAT to clears
   - if hypotensive, consider adding stress dose steroids
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   2. Leukocytosis - recently started on prednisone 20mg daily on [**2181-4-20**]
   by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**]. No evidence of infection at this time, but will
   continue to monitor.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   3. Hyponatremia - patient has been struggling for months now with
   nausea, vomiting and difficulty tolerating PO. He could be very
   dehydrated. Already received 2L NS in ED, and will give pRBC's here,
   with continuation of IVF overnight. On last admission sodium was wnl.
   Cr is just slightly elevated, also raising suspicion for mild prerenal
   azotemia.
   - monitor
   - IVF, NS PRN
   .
   4. Tachycardia - resolving with IVF. Will monitor on tele.
   .
   5. Metastatic Melanoma - currently traveling to [**Location (un) 3327**] to see Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 5606**] for evaluation for the Plexikon clinical trial. He is awaiting
   tumor tissue analysis to determine eligibility. It is unclear when the
   next open slot will be and another cycle of chemotherapy was advised
   given his symptoms, which was initiated on [**2181-4-20**].
   - supportive care, pain regimen
   - further plan per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5607**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**] (they are aware of
   patient
s admission)
   .
   6. FEN - IVF and pRBC's. NPO until plan is finalized, then advance to
   clears as tolerated. Replete lytes prn.
   .
   7. Access - 2 18 gauges
   .
   8. Code - Full, confirmed with patient
   .
   9. ICU Care - iv ppi given evidence of gastritis, pneumoboots
   .
   10. Dispo - ICU for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 27-year-old male with metastatic melanoma who presented with large-volume hematemesis. He has undergone radiation therapy, embolization of bilateral spheno-palantine branches of the IMAX, and serial HCT has been stable. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and hyponatremia, and has been receiving IV fluids and pRBCs. He has also been experiencing nausea, vomiting, and difficulty tolerating PO, and has received 2L NS in the ED.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Nasopharyngeal bleeding: The patient's nasopharyngeal mass has progressed, and there is a risk of posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma, which could explain his large-volume epistaxis and hematemesis.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a lesion suspicious for metastasis in the antrum of the stomach, and there is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be due to infection, and will need to be monitored for signs of infection.
4. Dehydration: The patient has been struggling with nausea, vomiting, and difficulty tolerating PO, which could lead to dehydration.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which could be due to dehydration or other causes, and will need to be monitored.
6. Tachycardia: The patient has tachycardia, which could be due to fever, dehydration, or other causes, and will need to be monitored.
7. Metastatic melanoma: The patient has metastatic melanoma, and will need to be monitored for progression of the disease and potential complications.
8. Bleeding complications: The patient has received radiation therapy and embolization, which could lead to bleeding complications.
9. Infection-related complications: The patient has received antibiotics, which could lead to infection-related complications.
10. Dehydration-related complications: The patient has received IV fluids, which could lead to dehydration-related complications.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's nasopharyngeal mass has progressed, and there is a risk of posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma. The patient will need to be monitored for signs of bleeding and infection. The patient will also need to be monitored for dehydration and hyponatremia, and will need to receive IV fluids and electrolyte replacement as needed. The patient will also need to be monitored for tachycardia and will need to receive anti-tachycardic medications as needed. The patient will also need to be monitored for metastatic melanoma and will need to receive further treatment as needed."
