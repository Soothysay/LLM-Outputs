   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 13471**] is a 85 year-old female with hypertension, PVD, complete
   block s/p pacemaker placement, and an ischemic right leg s/p
   thrombectomy and RLE angiogram complicated by a small perforation being
   monitored in the CCU for hematoma formation.
   # Ischemic R foot s/p thrombectomy and RLE angiogram with small
   performation: Vascular surgery has been consulted.  Her anticoagulation
   with heparin has been reversed with protamine.  Her initial Hct is
   stable at 35.7.  She denies any pain currently.
   - Active type and screen.
   - Immediate Hct check now and trend for q6h
   - Appreciate vascular surgery consult, will f/u recs.
   - Will monitor calf circumference and peripheral pulses q2h.
   - Hold off anticoagulation currently.
   - Continue plavix 75 mg po daily.
   # CORONARIES: Patient was reported to have elevated CEs at the OSH,
   however her CK here was normal and her trop was 0.03.  She has no
   history of chest pain, but does have severe PVD which makes the
   likelihood of CAD high.  She has had no previous catheterizations in
   our system.
   - Defer workup for possible CAD to primary [**Hospital1 1896**] team/outpatient setting
   once her acute situation has resolved.
   - Will continue the B-blocker and ASA which was started here by the
   [**Hospital1 1896**] team unless she has evidence of bleeding.
   # PUMP/Hypertension:  The patient appears euvolemic.
   - Continue home Amlodipine 5mg PO daily.
   - Will continue holding her home lasix for now.
   # RHYTHM: She had complete heart block s/p pacemaker placement.
   Admission EKG showed V-paced rhythm.
   - Monitor on telemetry.
   # Tobacco use:
   - Smoking cessation counceling.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), complete heart block with a pacemaker, and an ischemic right leg following thrombectomy and RLE angiogram complicated by a small perforation. She is currently being monitored in the ICU for hematoma formation. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 150/52 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 94%, and she is not receiving respiratory support.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 330 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to her peripheral vascular disease, and she is not able to assess her peripheral pulses. She is not experiencing pain and is responding to stimuli.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's anticoagulation with heparin has been reversed with protamine, and she is being monitored for hematoma formation. Vascular surgery has been consulted, and the patient is being closely monitored for any signs of bleeding or hematoma formation. Her initial Hct is stable at 35.7%.

The patient is being advised to hold off anticoagulation currently and to continue taking Plavix 75 mg PO daily. She is being monitored for calf circumference and peripheral pulses every 2 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hematoma formation: The patient's small perforation during thrombectomy and RLE angiogram increases her risk of hematoma formation, which could lead to bleeding and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's PVD and recent thrombectomy increase her risk of developing DVT, which could lead to pulmonary embolism and other complications.
3. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient's history of PVD and elevated CEs at the OSH suggest that she may have underlying CAD, which could increase her risk of cardiac complications.
4. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and recent use of antihypertensive medications increase her risk of developing hypertension, which could lead to cardiac complications.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but her underlying PVD and potential CAD increase her risk of developing respiratory failure.
6. Sepsis: The patient's recent surgical procedure and potential infection increase her risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ failure and death.

Given the patient's complex medical history and recent surgical procedure, it is essential to closely monitor her for any signs of bleeding, hematoma formation, DVT, CAD, hypertension, respiratory failure, or sepsis."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 13471**] is a 85 year-old female with hypertension, PVD, complete
   block s/p pacemaker placement, and an ischemic right leg s/p
   thrombectomy and RLE angiogram complicated by a small perforation being
   monitored in the CCU for hematoma formation or possible compartment
   syndrome.
   # Ischemic R foot s/p thrombectomy and RLE angiogram with small
   performation: Vascular surgery has been consulted.  Her anticoagulation
   with heparin has been reversed with protamine.  Her initial Hct is
   stable at 35.7.  She denies any pain currently.

   - Immediate Hct check now and trend for q6h
   - Appreciate vascular surgery consult, will f/u recs.
   - Will monitor calf circumference and peripheral pulses q2h.
   - Hold off anticoagulation currently.
   - Continue plavix 75 mg po daily.
   # CORONARIES: Patient was reported to have elevated CEs at the OSH,
   however her CK here was normal and her trop was 0.03.  She has no
   history of chest pain, but does have severe PVD which makes the
   likelihood of CAD high.  She has had no previous catheterizations in
   our system.

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old female who underwent a right leg thrombectomy and RLE angiogram complicated by a small perforation of the distal peroneal artery. She is currently being monitored in the ICU for hematoma formation or possible compartment syndrome. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 150/52 mmHg. Her respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 94% and no respiratory support. Her physical examination is notable for a well-healing incision on her right leg with some tenderness and ecchymoses on her arms.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hematoma formation: The patient's small perforation of the distal peroneal artery increases the risk of hematoma formation, which could lead to compartment syndrome and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Compartment syndrome: The patient's ischemic right leg and small perforation increase the risk of compartment syndrome, which could lead to tissue necrosis and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of PVD and recent thrombectomy increase the risk of DVT, which could lead to pulmonary embolism and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of PVD and recent thrombectomy increase the risk of pulmonary embolism, which could lead to respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of hypertension, PVD, and complete heart block increase the risk of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and potentially life-threatening cardiac events.
6. Infection: The patient's surgical site and recent trauma increase the risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Bleeding: The patient's recent surgery and anticoagulation therapy increase the risk of bleeding, which could lead to hemorrhagic complications and potentially life-threatening events.
8. Renal failure: The patient's history of hypertension and recent surgery increase the risk of renal failure, which could lead to potentially life-threatening complications."

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), complete heart block with a pacemaker, and an ischemic right leg following thrombectomy and RLE angiogram with a small perforation. She is currently in the ICU for monitoring of hematoma formation or possible compartment syndrome. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 124/46 mmHg, and SpO2 of 93%. Her physical examination reveals a faint heart sound, lungs clear, and normoactive bowel sounds. She has a well-healing incision on her right femoral area with a tender hematoma and bruise.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Compartment syndrome: The patient's right leg is at risk for compartment syndrome due to the small perforation and potential bleeding. Monitoring of calf circumference and peripheral pulses every 2 hours is essential to detect any changes.
2. Hematoma formation: The patient's right leg is at risk for hematoma formation, which can lead to compartment syndrome and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's PVD and history of thrombectomy make her at risk for DVT, which can be exacerbated by immobility in the ICU.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's PVD and history of thrombectomy also increase her risk for pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening.
5. Heart block: The patient's complete heart block with a pacemaker requires close monitoring of her heart rhythm and potential adjustments to her pacemaker settings.
6. Ischemic right foot: The patient's ischemic right foot is at risk for further complications, such as gangrene or amputation, if not properly managed.
7. Infection: The patient's wound and potential bleeding sites are at risk for infection, which can lead to sepsis and other complications.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying PVD and potential respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure, require close monitoring and potential interventions.
9. Cardiac failure: The patient's underlying hypertension and potential cardiac complications, such as heart failure, require close monitoring and potential interventions.
10. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation status and potential bleeding risks require close monitoring and potential adjustments to her anticoagulation therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, complete heart block, and an ischemic right leg following thrombectomy and RLE angiogram complicated by a small perforation. She is being monitored for hematoma formation or possible compartment syndrome. The patient is currently stable, with no overnight events reported. Her vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 124/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%.

Physical examination reveals a faint heart sound, normoactive bowel sounds, and soft, non-tender abdomen. Her right femoral area has a well-healing incision with staples and a large old bruise, with some tenderness over the incision. Her left femoral area has a dressing in place with slight oozing of red blood. Her right leg circumference is 34 cm and stable, with sensation intact.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.7, hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, platelet count of 95 K/uL, and creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hematoma formation or compartment syndrome in the right leg, which can lead to further ischemia, necrosis, or even amputation.
2. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, given the patient's history of complete heart block and pacemaker placement.
3. Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, given the patient's age and underlying medical conditions.
4. Renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease, given the patient's history of hypertension and peripheral vascular disease.
5. Infection, such as deep vein thrombosis or sepsis, given the patient's history of vascular surgery and presence of a central line.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings to prevent and manage potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and complete heart block, who underwent pacemaker placement and thrombectomy for an ischemic right leg. She has been admitted to the ICU for monitoring of hematoma formation or possible compartment syndrome. Her current condition is stable, with no signs of worsening compartment syndrome or hematoma. Her hemoglobin (Hct) levels have stabilized at 30%, and her vital signs are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hematoma formation: The patient's right leg is at risk of hematoma formation, which could lead to compartment syndrome and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Compartment syndrome: The patient's ischemic right leg is at risk of compartment syndrome, which could lead to tissue necrosis and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of PVD and recent thrombectomy make her at risk of developing DVT.
4. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's history of PVD and recent thrombectomy also make her at risk of developing PE.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of complete heart block and recent pacemaker placement make her at risk of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and heart failure.
6. Infection: The patient's recent surgery and prolonged hospital stay make her at risk of developing infections, including wound infections and pneumonia.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's prolonged hospital stay and limited mobility make her at risk of developing nutritional deficiencies, including protein-energy malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies.
8. Pressure ulcers: The patient's prolonged hospital stay and limited mobility make her at risk of developing pressure ulcers.
9. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of PVD and recent surgery make her at risk of developing respiratory complications, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 13471**] is a 85 year-old female with hypertension, PVD, complete
   block s/p pacemaker placement, and an ischemic right leg s/p
   thrombectomy and RLE angiogram complicated by a small perforation being
   monitored in the CCU for hematoma formation or possible compartment
   syndrome.
   # Ischemic R foot s/p thrombectomy and RLE angiogram with small
   performation:
   Vascular surgery has been consulted.  Her anticoagulation with heparin
   had been reversed with protamine.  Her initial Hct is stable at 35.
   She denies any pain currently.  Hct now stable at 30 but no worsening
   signs on exam, no signs of compartment syndrome.
   - Active type and screen.
   - trend Hct daily and monitor for compartment syndrome
   - Appreciate vascular surgery consult, will f/u recs.
   - Will monitor calf circumference and peripheral pulses q2h.
   - Hold off anticoagulation currently.
   - Continue plavix 75 mg po daily.
   # NSTEMI/Demand Ischemia:
   Patient was reported to have elevated CEs at the OSH, however her CK
   here was normal and her trop was 0.03.  She has no history of chest
   pain, but does have severe PVD which makes the likelihood of CAD high.
   She has had no previous catheterizations in our system.
   - Defer workup for possible CAD to primary floor Cardiology
   team/outpatient setting once her acute situation has resolved.
   - Will continue the B-blocker and ASA which was started here by the
   floor Cardiology team unless she has evidence of bleeding.
   # PUMP/Hypertension:  The patient appears euvolemic.
   - Continue home Amlodipine 5mg PO daily.
   - Will continue holding her home lasix for now.
   # RHYTHM: She had complete heart block s/p pacemaker placement.
   Admission EKG showed V-paced rhythm.
   - Monitor on telemetry.
   # Tobacco use:
   - Smoking cessation counseling.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), complete heart block after pacemaker placement, and an ischemic right leg after thrombectomy and RLE angiogram. She is currently in the ICU for monitoring for hematoma formation or possible compartment syndrome.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 71 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 150/60 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 93%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a stable cardiac output and no signs of cardiac compromise.

The patient's physical examination reveals a tender hematoma and bruise around the incision site in the right leg, with stable leg circumference and sensation intact. Her pulses are normal, with no signs of compartment syndrome.

Laboratory results show a stable hemoglobin level, with a slight drop in hematocrit from 35.7 to 30.7%. The patient's platelet count is 307 K/uL, and her creatinine level is 0.8 mg/dL. Her white blood cell count is 9.7 K/uL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 24 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hematoma formation or expansion: The patient's tender hematoma and bruise around the incision site suggest a risk of hematoma formation or expansion, which can lead to compartment syndrome or bleeding.
2. Compartment syndrome: The patient's symptoms of leg pain and tender hematoma suggest a risk of compartment syndrome, which can lead to muscle and nerve damage if left untreated.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of hypertension, PVD, and complete heart block after pacemaker placement put her at risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
4. Infection: The patient's presence in the ICU and her history of surgery increase her risk of infection, particularly with the use of central lines and other invasive devices.
5. Bleeding: The patient's history of anticoagulation with heparin and her current hold on anticoagulation therapy put her at risk for bleeding, particularly at the incision site.
6. Thrombosis: The patient's history of thrombectomy and RLE angiogram put her at risk for thrombosis, particularly in the right leg.

In terms of the patient's management, the plan is to continue monitoring her for hematoma formation or possible compartment syndrome, with daily trending of her hemoglobin level and monitoring of her calf circumference and peripheral pulses every 2 hours. The patient will also be continued on prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy will be held for now. The patient will be transferred to the floor once her acute situation has resolved."
